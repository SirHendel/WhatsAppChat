03.12.22, 12:47 - Niki: Yeah I think I ask him but he didn't respond because we were distracted by what was going on in dnd at that time. So still no idea if he wants to come with us
03.12.22, 12:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, guess we'll have to ask him some other time then. Maybe I'll just send him a message to ask
03.12.22, 12:51 - Niki: yeah sounds good

03.12.22, 12:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I was thinking... If you look at the plan we made up, we could take Anthony with us for 1 day and then pass by Fantoft, after that drive on to the next place? Idk

25.12.22, 00:10 - Niki: Oh boy Aeneas is coming over u need to keep me update. 
Yeah to day was kinda fun told my parents about the trip in Norway and u guys. There were really interested in all of the friends I made "up there". One of my sister also somehow figured out that I have a girlfriend. She knows me to well I don't know 😅
25.12.22, 00:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll definitely keep you up-to-date! No one really asked me any questions, it was just a nice get together with the family. Kind of wished they did, it would give me a great excuse to tell them about you 😅
I love that your sister already figured it out, how did she respond to that??
Aeneas also gave me some really nice pictures, I'll send them to you!
25.12.22, 00:21 - Niki: Yeah my sister just want to take the trash out with me and the just ask if she is right about me have a gf. 
I was like yes but how? she just said that she new the moment I got in there room I don't know 🤨

You will find the right moment or Aeneas will find it for u in the drunk state of mind. Or nothing happens and u just tell them on the drive back 😆
25.12.22, 00:21 - Niki: Oh I think my sister was kinda proud to see me grow or something like that
25.12.22, 00:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

25.12.22, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's kinda cute
25.12.22, 00:26 - Niki: Yeah i don't know she is a alien for sure.

Was ur mom the one how said something about meeting some one in Norway?
25.12.22, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, my mom was the one who said something about that indeed. Especially because I think last time she called she asked something like "so there's really no one interesting around there?" And I was like "Nahhh... Not really" ... What a lie 🥲
25.12.22, 00:29 - Niki: I would love to see ur moms reaction. It will be priceless
25.12.22, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, if you're really lucky and I'm really stupid, Aeneas just might film it for you 😅😂
25.12.22, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Who knows what will happen tomorrow??
25.12.22, 00:33 - Niki: We will see. Good night 😘
25.12.22, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess we will! Goodnight 😘
25.12.22, 11:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aeneas arrived and this is the funniest shit ever I swear 😂
25.12.22, 14:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out... My dad and Aeneas have the exact same coat... This is complete and utter bullshit 😂
25.12.22, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aeneas just left and it's been a great day, a lot of fun... But it also really made me miss you, I just wanted to tell you that 😅
25.12.22, 20:35 - Niki: Hope u parent had a good impression of him. I didn't want to write you anything to make u feel bad. But I also missed u a lot since yesterday. Love you ❤️
25.12.22, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They had a pretty good impression of him, they were quite taken by his honesty. You wouldn't make me feel bad saying anything ❤️
25.12.22, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also, I told my parents... Quite honestly their reactions were quite funny. My dad especially, he got up to get a glass of whiskey first of all 😅... And then he said he's happy you're at least German 😂... My mom was just happy!
25.12.22, 23:47 - Niki: Love the reaction from ur dad. I would have thought he would do something like this from how u discribe him. What nationality was he sacred of France?
25.12.22, 23:49 - Niki: Good night 😘
26.12.22, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... Quite honestly I think there are few nationalities he'd have reacted better to than German... Although this also means that I will have to suffer to my whole family's relentless German jokes for the rest of the week. It was foolish of me to hope that telling just my parents wouldn't mean my whole family finding out by the morning of course... 😅
26.12.22, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight 😘
26.12.22, 00:05 - Niki: I believe u can endure it😁. If there is a good one u can share it with me.
26.12.22, 00:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... there's been so many already I... You can't possibly expect me to remember them 😭
26.12.22, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad has already started to subconsciously say things in German now... Just to fuck with me... I'll endure it but god knows I will struggle not to choke them
26.12.22, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why oh why is messing with someone the love language of my family?? 😂
26.12.22, 00:08 - Niki: Haha I will cover for u if need it.
26.12.22, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh I'd pay to see that 😂
26.12.22, 00:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Night ❤️
26.12.22, 00:20 - Niki: Night ❤️
26.12.22, 09:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are your plans for today? More Christmas celebrations or are those done?
26.12.22, 09:41 - Niki: More Christmas celebrations with my dad's side of the family. Again around 15 people. Most of the are quit nice.
 What about ur plans for today?
26.12.22, 09:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So many celebrations! We're thankfully done with those! I'm just going to show my family the fantoft church and a couple of other things today, pretty chill
26.12.22, 09:55 - Niki: Yeah but today is the last day of celebrations so it's okay. 
Sounds really nice hope the weather is good in Bergen.
26.12.22, 09:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you have fun! The weather in Bergen is... Rainy, so they're definitely having the Norway experience!
26.12.22, 15:55 - Niki: Finally done with the christmas celebration with the family. Now meeting up with some friends. What are u plans for tonight?
26.12.22, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That was done pretty early! Have fun with your friends! We're going to the gingerbread house city and then we're just having a nice movie night.
26.12.22, 20:30 - Niki: Hope the like the gingerbread houses. I watch with my family glass onion knives out was pretty nice. I can  recommend it.
26.12.22, 20:30 - Niki: Yeah there pure chaos but it's nice to hang with them again.
26.12.22, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Creepy fact, that was exactly the movie we were gonna watch 😂
26.12.22, 20:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not sure we still will though, we only just finished dinner and everyone is quite tired.
26.12.22, 20:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... I look forward to hanging out with my friends again too, the chaos is brilliant 😁
27.12.22, 00:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Night ❤️
27.12.22, 01:00 - Niki: Night ❤️
27.12.22, 13:52 - Niki: What are ur plans with ur family today? Mabye visit Anthony and Aeneas in fantoft. Anthony is sick mabye u can bring him some ginger tee.
27.12.22, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We just got done going snowshoe hiking, I would have sent you a message but I was late already when we left 😅.
We're now driving back. Yeah, I heard that Anthony is sick, he's not allowing anyone in though... I'll go to fantoft tomorrow so I'll check up on him then. What are your plans today?
27.12.22, 14:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or well, last time I checked he was just sleeping, let me put it that way
27.12.22, 14:31 - Niki: The christmas celebration is over for my family so now we sit back and watch some movies and play some games together. How was the snowshoe hike did u take some pictures?
27.12.22, 14:31 - Niki: Okay still a bit worried about them because I can't see the regular and he is also sick.
27.12.22, 14:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What movies are you watching? Sounds fun and relaxing! I took a couple of pictures but my camera is awful, I'll send you a couple when I get the pictures my family took
27.12.22, 14:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... I'm also worried about them, Anthony is sick, Jingwen is apparently also getting sick again and Aeneas... Is just really not looking forward to going back home again. I felt bad when he spent the day with my family because he said he felt jealous and I didn't really know how to handle that. I'll definitely ask him to hang out tomorrow though, I'm going back to fantoft to clean up but we could probably play some pool as well and just hang out
27.12.22, 14:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And Anthony... He sent me a message about french fries today so I think he's getting better, I'll let you know when I see them both tomorrow
27.12.22, 14:34 - Niki: Glass onion knives out, the hunger games and now watching some series "1899" on Netflix
27.12.22, 14:35 - Niki: Sound good
27.12.22, 14:37 - Niki: Don't feel bad I know it's hard. Hope he can forget about home some more and then prepare him self for it
27.12.22, 14:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope so too, and if he needs it we're just a call away :)
27.12.22, 14:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any exciting plans for the next couple of days?
27.12.22, 14:40 - Niki: Meet with some friends to go watch avatar 2 and good family time.
27.12.22, 14:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a really good time
27.12.22, 14:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't spoil avatar 2 please, I have no clue when I'm going to be able to watch it 😅
27.12.22, 14:43 - Niki: Yeah no worrys would dare to 😁
27.12.22, 15:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
27.12.22, 15:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

27.12.22, 15:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
27.12.22, 15:51 - Niki: Looks real beautiful but also real tiring.
27.12.22, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was really amazing, not that tiring honestly, just a lot of fun :)
27.12.22, 15:56 - Niki: Nice whats the plan for tonight
27.12.22, 15:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My family is going to the sauna, I'm staying home with my cousin and grandparents, after that dinner and then maybe we'll go to a bar, not sure yet. What are you doing tonight?
27.12.22, 16:02 - Niki: I need to drive my sister somewhere and my family watches darts. Tonight we cook together again will be fun. Hope you enjoy the night with ur cousin and grandparents
27.12.22, 16:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, it's the world championship right? I read about Belgium doing pretty good I think? Any idea of what you're cooking? Have fun with your family as well ❤️
27.12.22, 16:08 - Niki: My dad said they have some good players. I don't know what we cook. I just cut and do what my mum and sister tell me to do 😅
27.12.22, 16:08 - Niki: Thx will do ❤️
27.12.22, 16:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, this reminds me of something 😜
27.12.22, 22:25 - Niki: Good night ❤️
27.12.22, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good night ❤️
28.12.22, 21:14 - Niki: How was your day today while you were sick? What did u do? Are u the only one in ur family that's sick? Hope u get better soon
28.12.22, 21:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My way quite honestly sucked, just slept through most of it honestly. It's only now that I'm feeling a little bit better and I just got to eat something. No worries, I'll be better soon! I'm not the only one, my grandpa also isn't feeling too good, but I think it might have been food poisoning from the sushi we had yesterday. How was your day? I hope a lot better than mine!
28.12.22, 21:20 - Niki: Sounds better than I thought even though it's still suck at least u get better. My sister gone back to where she life. My parents when on vacation over new year. So I am now alone at home. Right now I watch avatar with friends and it's 3 hours long. There is a break now but it ends now see u after the movie.
28.12.22, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, at least I'm getting better now. I hope I'll be back to normal tomorrow though, otherwise the 2 day roadtrip will be hell 😅
Are you meeting up with your friends for new years? I hope you enjoyed the family time, even when it was short!
Enjoy avatar!!
28.12.22, 22:59 - Niki: New year party with friends is kinda in danger now because some of the can't come so we don't know if we do it now. Hope u get better have a good night of sleep
28.12.22, 23:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aw, that sucks. Did you enjoy the movie? I hope you have fun on new years nonetheless!
28.12.22, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not gonna go to sleep yet, I have wayyy too much energy after sleeping all day 😅
28.12.22, 23:08 - Niki: Yeah kinda sucks  but it's okay. Yeah the movie was good.
28.12.22, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm glad you enjoyed your night then 😘
29.12.22, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
29.12.22, 00:34 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
29.12.22, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
29.12.22, 11:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today? We're just driving all day
29.12.22, 11:26 - Niki: My great parents invited for lunch but my Great grandfather died so I don't know if they still have the time. The rest of the day I have nothing planned now. Are u going to take a farry tonight? Did u already pack everything?
29.12.22, 11:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh shit, are you alright?
29.12.22, 11:30 - Niki: I didn't know him that well we only saw each other on Christmas but not this year he was already sick. I don't know how to say it right but it was no surprise that he die.
29.12.22, 11:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, I understand. Still I'm sorry for your loss ❤️
29.12.22, 11:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We packed everything and we're already on our way to Oslo, we're taking the ferry tomorrow so we're staying in a hotel tonight. I said bye to the guys this morning :(
29.12.22, 11:35 - Niki: How was the goodbye. Where they okay like mentally. Did Aeneas say anything about going back? Is Anthony still sick?
29.12.22, 11:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anthony is still sick, but I think he is slowly getting better. They're taking a plane tomorrow... They didn't really say much about how they were feeling, other than Jingwen saying he really doesn't want to go back either. I think mentally all of them were doing alright, but I'm planning on sending them a message sometime tomorrow to remind them that they can always call. My dad also invited them to Ghent so we'll definitely be seeing them sometime in the next year.
29.12.22, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was kinda hard to say anything really emotional because my family was closeby taking some weird photos 😅
Then again, it didn't really feel like a goodbye, god knows I am 100% sure I'll see them again next year
29.12.22, 11:43 - Niki: Yeah for sure. I want to see them around Ende of January next year. I want to come to Belgium for a week first if u have the time. After that I though we could  go to France if u want to?
29.12.22, 11:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll talk to my parents about you staying with us for a week, but I'd absolutely love that! And we're definitely going to France!
29.12.22, 11:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad loves the roadtrip playlist I put together from the songs we listened to :)
29.12.22, 11:49 - Niki: Nice hope the way to  Oslo goes by a bit faster with the Playlist ☺️
29.12.22, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I sure hope so too, but at least the view is really nice as well, the snowy landscape is absolutely amazing
29.12.22, 12:05 - Niki: I already miss the landscape of Norway 😢
29.12.22, 16:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Norway is gorgeous, but driving for 7 hours does get boring after a while. What are you up to?
29.12.22, 16:09 - Niki: After I ate lunch with my grandparents. I Just slept till now. Don't know what I should do now though. Your in Oslo now?
29.12.22, 16:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I swear you're like a cat sometimes, sleeping so much 😂
Nah, we're still driving to Oslo, it's getting very boring. My aunt is sleeping, her boyfriend is driving and my dad is not the most talkative in the car, something I get from him 😅
29.12.22, 16:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No clue what you could do now either... Watch a movie? Read a book? Solve a puzzle? Talk to me? ;)
29.12.22, 16:13 - Niki: Yeah I don't know just felt like sleeping. What ever u wanna talk about I am up to it. How long u still need to drive?
29.12.22, 16:14 - Niki: It didn't felt than long for me to drive from Bergen to Oslo but it long xD
29.12.22, 16:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough, sleep is very nice! We still have at least 2 hours of driving to go... The roads aren't great and we had to take a detour because one of the mountain passes was closed
29.12.22, 16:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I slept... 16 hours since yesterday sooo... I honestly can't say anything 😂
29.12.22, 16:16 - Niki: The detour suck. How much did it snow in the last days up there
29.12.22, 16:16 - Niki: If ur sick it's just great to sleep
29.12.22, 16:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite a lot I think, lots of places we passed had a meter of snow or something, it's crazy
29.12.22, 16:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly
29.12.22, 16:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But also just in general
29.12.22, 16:17 - Niki: Man would love to see you 😘 and the snow again
29.12.22, 16:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a great combination indeed 😘
29.12.22, 16:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wanna just ask random questions we both have to answer?
29.12.22, 16:19 - Niki: Sure sounds fun
29.12.22, 16:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay... 1 place that is on your bucket list to visit?
29.12.22, 16:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For me that's Iceland
29.12.22, 16:20 - Niki: Gent right now
29.12.22, 16:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute ❤️
29.12.22, 16:22 - Niki: Iceland is crazy. My parents and my uncle be there and the pictures are awesome. Kinda looks like a other planet
29.12.22, 16:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I know some people that went and it sounds really interesting, if not extremely expensive 😭, maybe in a couple of years!
29.12.22, 16:23 - Niki: Yeah it crazy expensive
29.12.22, 16:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Your turn for a question?
29.12.22, 16:25 - Niki: What's your favorite movie of all time? I know that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was ur favorite for a while still is ?
29.12.22, 16:27 - Niki: My is animate one is Howl's Moving Castle
And favorite of all time is hard there to many good ones to pick one
29.12.22, 16:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... I mean, I really do like the movie but I'm not sure it is my favourite of all time anymore... I honestly don't really have an answer for this one... Though I do also love Les Choristes, but it's been too long since I last saw it... It's too hard to pick!
29.12.22, 16:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really should watch Howl's Moving Castle...
29.12.22, 16:29 - Niki: We can watch it together if u want to love to see it again. I really dislike watch movies again because I remember everything the first 5 min but not with this one I don't know
29.12.22, 16:29 - Niki: I have never seen les choristes.
29.12.22, 16:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, I have the same thing with movies! There's only a couple that I can rewatch, same thing with books.
29.12.22, 16:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a French movie I once saw in class, but I have no clue where to find it 🥲
29.12.22, 16:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can definitely watch Howl's Moving Castle together
29.12.22, 16:31 - Niki: Mabye we can ask Anthony if he know where to find it?
29.12.22, 16:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's a good idea!
29.12.22, 16:32 - Niki: Ur next question?
29.12.22, 16:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Favourite season and why?
29.12.22, 16:35 - Niki: Winter or fall because of the cold and jsut the feeling around them. Don't know how to describe it. Just feels nicer than summer or spring
29.12.22, 16:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For me it's winter in the Nordics, but autumn in Belgium, specific, I know 😅
The reason is that I love snow, but we rarely ever have it in Belgium, so I like autumn best because it is very cosy!
29.12.22, 16:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe controversial but I really dislike summer. It's too hot, too many mosquitoes and all that
29.12.22, 16:39 - Niki: Mabye but I am also on this one. Don't like it either especially because my family drag me too camping with them in the summertime from when I was 11 till I was 16 years. Was nice camping but the heat and the mosquitoes where 2x times worse than at home.
29.12.22, 16:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's very understandable
29.12.22, 16:41 - Niki: What's the best year in your life except this year and why what happened?
29.12.22, 16:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goddamn, uhm... I need to think about this one
29.12.22, 16:44 - Niki: My was probably 2018. Me and my friends did a lot of stupid stuff and it was really fun. Was also the year i realized what I want to do in the future. That help me a lot with me personally.
29.12.22, 16:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably 2018, not because it was such a great year for me, but mostly because of how much I grew in that year I think? I had to completely rethink my future path in that year, had to start getting along with completely different people from what I was used to and just... Started looking at the world in a different way?
29.12.22, 16:44 - Niki: We just connected some how 😁
29.12.22, 16:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We seem to have a lot in common 😂
29.12.22, 16:45 - Niki: Sounds really interesting would love to speak to manon from that year
29.12.22, 16:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh believe me, she was silly and way too insecure+ hiding it behind a small superiority complex... She wasn't bad at all, but I believe she changed a lot since then 😅
29.12.22, 16:48 - Niki: Sounds like it but I think I would still get along with her pretty well
29.12.22, 16:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Perhaps!
29.12.22, 16:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What is a realisation you had this year that changed something for you?
29.12.22, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For me, I think I realised I'm much more independent and dependable than I always gave myself credit for. Really boosted my self confidence a lot
29.12.22, 16:51 - Niki: I just realized that the future the think I was waiting for was now. I could go where ever I want to and I could do next in life what ever I want to. So I start doing more stupid stuff with my friends and everything I got the chance too.
29.12.22, 16:52 - Niki: Sound like you to be honest 😁
29.12.22, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have no clue how much self confidence I gained just being in Norway honestly 😅
29.12.22, 16:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That... Sounds like something I probably should realise too 😅
29.12.22, 16:54 - Niki: Sounds perfect I will help you where ever I can.
29.12.22, 16:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Your next question?
29.12.22, 16:56 - Niki: Whats the one think object u would never ever give up?
29.12.22, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My cat teddybear I got from my great grandma. I have taken that thing literally everywhere, it has seen more of the world than half the people I know and that's not even an exaggeration. I'm just very sentimental about it I guess
29.12.22, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe a little childish but eh, I don't really care about that
29.12.22, 17:00 - Niki: My is a teddy bear from when I was 1. It does have that much value to me but it's been there since I could think and it saw me in every phase of my life
29.12.22, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... How? 😂
29.12.22, 17:01 - Niki: I also thought it was mabye a bit childish and want to rigth something else but well
29.12.22, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, guess we match anyway ;)
29.12.22, 17:02 - Niki: Your next question?
29.12.22, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Favourite thing you've read (book, newspaper article, anything)?
29.12.22, 17:03 - Niki: Karl-Heinz Tuschel – Die Insel der Roboter
29.12.22, 17:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not my favourite book, but it's something that always stuck with me after reading it and that is Chesil Beach. I had to read it for school and did not expect I was going to like it at all. I loved it so much, it was brilliant to read because of how the characters were written.
29.12.22, 17:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's it about?
29.12.22, 17:04 - Niki: I don't know why but this book got my attention and brought me back to reading books again
29.12.22, 17:05 - Niki: It's about the creation of a Maschine that can work under any circumstances. I don't know it kinda weird but I like it 😅
29.12.22, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds interesting!
29.12.22, 17:06 - Niki: Sounds really nice we only need to read German classic that are drag to read like Faust and more
29.12.22, 17:07 - Niki: It's also a place in the real world
29.12.22, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, yeah, most of the books we had to read absolutely sucked, and I'm sure 90% of my class hated this one as well, but it struck a cord in me somehow
29.12.22, 17:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's where most of the booked is set. It's about a couple on their wedding night but they both have very different expectations of what is going to happen. Quite explicit at times but really interesting!
29.12.22, 17:10 - Niki: Sounds interesting
29.12.22, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe that's a bit of a very broad description, basically the woman is asexual (though this is never said explicitly throughout the book) so when the moment arrives she is absolutely disgusted and runs away, the man on the other hand has been looking forward to this moment their whole relationship and is absolutely horrified by what happens. This is then explained from both sides and just the psychological idea behind the book is really interesting, especially because it is set in the 80s, idk, I just found it really nice
29.12.22, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think it's your turn for a question?
29.12.22, 17:15 - Niki: If u could go back in time and change on decision of one of your friends which one would it be and what's the decision?
29.12.22, 17:18 - Niki: My would be my friend Ole and his decision to go back to his ex because she was a toxic nightmare. She didnt call him or text him he didn't receive any love from her its was hard to see a friend like this and he was still so in love. I don't know even thing about it makes me sad and mad at her. In the Ende after 2 years he final realized it and I was so happy for him
29.12.22, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... Interesting... Probably my friend getting together with her ex... While I think she did mature through the relationship, it definitely hurt her a lot as well and I want to protect her from that. However, I also don't want to control what she does so I never said anything against it as long as I wasn't aware of the hurt it brought her.
29.12.22, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm glad your friend realised she was toxic, damn, it always sucks to see that happen to your friends
29.12.22, 17:20 - Niki: I was straight up against the relationship. Yeah it just hurts to see your friends like this and then they are blind by love to see the other person.
29.12.22, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely, my friend's ex was 6 years older than her and I was fucking apprehensive against it, especially because she was 17 when they first got to know each other, and 18 when they got together. He seemed like an alright guy though and she was happy at first so I thought it was alright. I never really saw him enough to make a good estimation of him.
29.12.22, 17:23 - Niki: But after this I told him I would break into his house and kidnap his cats if he goes back to her.
29.12.22, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have to use that threat next time, I bet it would work with her dog as well
29.12.22, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Favourite place to go/thing to do when you're upset?
29.12.22, 17:26 - Niki: Talk with Alex about it he either talks me down or we do stupid stuff together.
29.12.22, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I like to go to a bridge near my house over some train tracks and just... Look around? I don't know, it feels soothing.
29.12.22, 17:27 - Niki: Like driving 6 hours to the see to take a dive and freeze our ass off
29.12.22, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Talking to Alex definitely works as well though 😂
29.12.22, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fuck that's so long to the sea 😭
29.12.22, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a great thing to do when you're upset though
29.12.22, 17:28 - Niki: Sounds like a perfect save places to relax
29.12.22, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... Safe is subjective
29.12.22, 17:28 - Niki: Emotional Support Alex 😅
29.12.22, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly!
29.12.22, 17:29 - Niki: Whats your favorite food and made by how?
29.12.22, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anything my grandma makes... That woman cooks with her heart and you can taste it goddamn. More specifically though I love when she makes broccoli courgette soup or cheesecake, but yeah, literally anything she makes
29.12.22, 17:31 - Niki: Mine is pancakeade by my mum because she made them everytime I was sad when I was small. She made them everytime one of my siblings was also sad so it's a thing for all of us.
29.12.22, 17:32 - Niki: Hope I can taste it sometime in the future
29.12.22, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We'll see 😘
29.12.22, 17:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's 1 thing you would never do? (I'm talking bungee jumping or things like that, not murder obviously)
29.12.22, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd never climb the Burj Khalifa (no matter how impossible it is to even get permission to do that)
29.12.22, 17:36 - Niki: I am open for everything but I would probably be scared to death. If I go sky diving
29.12.22, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was also thinking that, I'm willing to try anything once, but somehow I still wouldn't climb the Burj Khalifa, it's just a feeling
29.12.22, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Scared to death to go sky diving though 😅
29.12.22, 17:38 - Niki: It's how u died in your last life
29.12.22, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, now that's an interesting theory... 🧐
29.12.22, 17:39 - Niki: What's your favorite snack?
29.12.22, 17:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This really depends, it changes often. Like right now it's maïs waffles, but other times it can be dried mango or anything really
29.12.22, 17:41 - Niki: My is the cinamon rolls right now. But yeah it changes a lot
29.12.22, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How many packs do you have left?
29.12.22, 17:41 - Niki: 10 or 9 I think
29.12.22, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going through them quickly I see 😜
29.12.22, 17:42 - Niki: I share them with my family though
29.12.22, 17:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair!
29.12.22, 17:43 - Niki: Yeah there just really nice and everytime I eat them I think about all the stuff from Norway. Just great snack
29.12.22, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Favourite and least favourite colour?
29.12.22, 17:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is usually blue purple or green, right now it's purple. Least favourite is brown or orange.
29.12.22, 17:46 - Niki: Purple, white and black are my favorites by far, least favorite is yellow
29.12.22, 17:46 - Niki: That reminds of the orange hoodie from your university.
29.12.22, 17:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... If it weren't so comfortable and holding good memories... I would never ever wear it 😅
29.12.22, 17:48 - Niki: But I also got a yellow shirt with the same thing
29.12.22, 17:49 - Niki: If u need to transform in to a animal which one would you chose?
29.12.22, 17:50 - Niki: I think I would love to be a panda. They feel like very nice animals to hang around and life with
29.12.22, 17:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably a Pallas Cat? They're adorable and very sneaky. In the past I probably would have said a koala though
29.12.22, 17:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pandas do sound like they have very chill lives
29.12.22, 17:51 - Niki: They look so cute
29.12.22, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They do
29.12.22, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What is a habit you have had ever since you were small?
29.12.22, 17:53 - Niki: I saw a video of them putting there paws on there tails to hold them warm sooo cute 😍
29.12.22, 17:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yessss ... Fucking cute 😍
29.12.22, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I pull on my lips when I'm thinking or anxious, or I bite them
29.12.22, 17:57 - Niki: I get coose bumms if i  hear the sounds of tooth bruching. 
I need to touch everthink i find interesting.
29.12.22, 17:57 - Niki: Saw that a few times. I find it really cute 🥰
29.12.22, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't realise I do it that often 😅
29.12.22, 17:59 - Niki: One memory of your childhood u don't know why but remember very clearly
29.12.22, 18:00 - Niki: Your still driving?
29.12.22, 18:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp...
29.12.22, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sitting underneath the table at my great grandma's house reading a book and listening to the conversation of the adults. I have absolutely no clue why I remember that so well. I think I was 7 or 8?
29.12.22, 18:04 - Niki: My is a memory of me and my cousin watching lion King on VS on the second Christmas day. I don't know why we just watch it all one one bed looking at a small screen.
29.12.22, 18:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh... This reminds me of another memory... One time I stayed over at my great grandma's place and we both woke up at 5am or something so we watched the gymnastics world championships together at 5am, I really liked that
29.12.22, 18:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That sounds fun 😊
29.12.22, 18:06 - Niki: Sounds like your grandmother is a wonderful person.
29.12.22, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She was, sadly passed away a couple of years ago but I really liked spending time with her 😊
29.12.22, 18:08 - Niki: Sad but sounds like you had only good memories of her
29.12.22, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do, but that's only natural
29.12.22, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, what is one thing you regret not doing?
29.12.22, 18:12 - Niki: That's hard need some time for this one
29.12.22, 18:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't say I regret anything because I'm quite happy with where I've gotten so far, but maybe I regret not telling the people in my life that I really appreciate them enough. Or just... Being sentimental? Especially towards my parents, we rarely ever talk about emotions and I can't even remember the last time I told them I love them by myself, even if I really really do.
29.12.22, 18:18 - Niki: Same for my family and my life. My sister and I start talk more about tis stuff but that's the only person in my family. I think i should tell more people that I love and appreciate them. I regret that I am also bad at staying in touch with some of my friends. But I try to change that's aspect of me.
29.12.22, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You just reminded me that I still have to wish one of my friends happy holidays 😭😅
29.12.22, 18:20 - Niki: This text summs up my feeling really really well and it's fits so well. I don't know
29.12.22, 18:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know how to explain that one but yeah, guess we match on that one as well
29.12.22, 18:21 - Niki: I think u describe it well in words but yeah it a weird feeling.
29.12.22, 18:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know, I normally do have a thing with words, let's just blame it one that
29.12.22, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Your turn?
29.12.22, 18:25 - Niki: What's on trade that you inherited from your parents that you like and dislike?
29.12.22, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh... That's a hard one... I might need to think about this one
29.12.22, 18:29 - Niki: My trade that I like is  my mums protection. I will allways side with the one in question first and try to understand his side.

One trade I don't like is my mums worry about thinks only if the look really bad. Before that she like" it will all work out in the Ende " and I am the same even thought I don't want to at times.
29.12.22, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think I necessarily have inherited any traits that I dislike, or maybe I just haven't discovered them yet? But some traits I do sometimes like and dislike are my rationality and ability to 'turn off' my emotions? It's very handy sometimes but it's also a defense mechanism that is very easy to get access to but also shuts people out.
29.12.22, 18:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Actually no, I do have 1 trait I dislike. My mom's need for independence to the point where asking for help is pretty much impossible
29.12.22, 18:30 - Niki: Sounds like a cures and a gift at the same time
29.12.22, 18:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A trait I like is the fairness both my parents instilled in me, as well as being sceptical about everything
29.12.22, 18:31 - Niki: Sounds like you sometimes 😁😊
29.12.22, 18:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh... I'm trying to work on it 😅
29.12.22, 18:32 - Niki: Great parenting from your parents.
29.12.22, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... The protection is a really good trait, but I see your problem with the other trait
29.12.22, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They certainly did the best they could and I'm personally convinced they did great 😊
29.12.22, 18:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We've arrived!!! 🥳🥳
29.12.22, 18:33 - Niki: Yeah it Handy sometimes if I want to relax but it also suck at times
29.12.22, 18:33 - Niki: .
29.12.22, 18:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I usually overthink everything so I see the blessing in that one for sure 😂
29.12.22, 18:34 - Niki: You need to check in now? What your family plan for the night?
29.12.22, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, we're gonna check in and find a place to eat now. You have any plans?
29.12.22, 18:37 - Niki: Need to make myself something to eat and need to call my parents
29.12.22, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a calm evening, enjoy it?😘
29.12.22, 18:39 - Niki: You too😘
29.12.22, 23:28 - Niki: Good night ❤️

31.12.22, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooh, let me know what you think! I just got to Kiel :)
31.12.22, 10:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any plans for today?
31.12.22, 10:19 - Niki: Lunch with my grandparents again. Then take the train to Leipzig and new years party with my friends. And you after the 8 hour drive?
31.12.22, 10:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun at the party! We're having a small get-together at my house with some family members, nothing too big, the question is whether or not we'll be home on time for the food 😅
31.12.22, 10:30 - Niki: Hope you make it but still drive save 😘
31.12.22, 10:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries, my dad and Pieter are both good drivers and my dad loves driving in Germany. Have a nice lunch with your grandparents 😘
31.12.22, 17:39 - Niki: Hope your family and you aren't too tried after driving for so long
31.12.22, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope so too because the table is ready and everything 😅
31.12.22, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
31.12.22, 17:41 - Niki: Looks better prepared than we are we search for a place to order like 30 min already
31.12.22, 17:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... We're the same family that made an excel for a holiday so... What did you expect honestly? Hope you find something soon though!
31.12.22, 17:43 - Niki: Yeah but I think we gone through most of them so mabye we will decide on something soon
31.12.22, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Remember that cousin of mine that is in a band? Apparently he doesn't play banjo (unfortunately) but bass instead... Dudes are actually good, I'm impressed 😅
31.12.22, 20:27 - Niki: Nice. Do they have something online?
31.12.22, 20:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not yet unfortunately, they only had 2 concerts so far. How's your evening going?
31.12.22, 20:31 - Niki: Pretty nice. We ate sushi and are now playing some games together. How is your evening going?
31.12.22, 20:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice! We just had some snacks and now my grandpa is making the first dish... It's gonna be wayyy too much and slightly over the top but should be delicious! It's fun so far, just chatting and all that
31.12.22, 20:34 - Niki: Sounds nice.
01.01.23, 00:18 - Niki: Happy new year❤️❤️
01.01.23, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Happy new year 😘❤️
01.01.23, 01:51 - Niki: Me and Alex are driving to a party from one of his old class mades from high school. I know like 2/30 people there 🥲
01.01.23, 01:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhm... Have fun?? Get to know some people?? We're literally cleaning up right now 😅
01.01.23, 01:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My parents wish you a happy new year as well 😊
01.01.23, 01:55 - Niki: I will try to have fun and I don't know about getting to know them. Not really in the mood to. Hope it's not that much to clean
01.01.23, 01:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah it's alright :)
If you really don't like it just call me, I'll keep you company 😊
01.01.23, 01:56 - Niki: Don't want to keep you awake
01.01.23, 01:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't worry about that, I'm not going to sleep anytime soon anyway
01.01.23, 01:58 - Niki: Okay mabye will see 😘
01.01.23, 01:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Try to have some fun first though ;)
01.01.23, 03:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Having fun? :)
01.01.23, 03:09 - Niki: Na not really but we're going to leave soon
01.01.23, 03:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, that's sad, good that you don't have to stay too much longer though!
01.01.23, 03:09 - Niki: At least two people sayed hello
01.01.23, 03:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's something? I mean, could be worse? 😅
01.01.23, 03:10 - Niki: Yeah but atleast we both don't want to stay
01.01.23, 03:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good, would suck if one of you wanted to stay and the other was bored as hell just waiting
01.01.23, 03:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just watching a series my dad recommended rn... No way I'm going to sleep soon 😅
01.01.23, 03:13 - Niki: What series ur watching? Sounds more interesting than this here
01.01.23, 03:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The recruit, it's about a recently graduated lawyer who starts working at the CIA and somehow gets involved in a mess
01.01.23, 03:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's quite good so far! Mostly comedy
01.01.23, 03:14 - Niki: Sounds interesting
01.01.23, 03:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'd definitely recommend if you have nothing to watch
01.01.23, 03:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How far did you get with Ragnarok?
01.01.23, 03:15 - Niki: Need to finish ragnarök first though 
2 session 2 episode
01.01.23, 03:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still 6 episodes to go then I think? Who is your favourite character so far? Alive or dead
01.01.23, 03:17 - Niki: Dead the green hair girl at the start and a live Loki
01.01.23, 03:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same... I loved her, really hated how quickly they killed her off 😅
And Loki doesn't need any explanation, he's just a vibe
01.01.23, 03:18 - Niki: Yeah her death was kinda the think that got me hooked
01.01.23, 03:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh my... Now you say it that is so true...
01.01.23, 03:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know how to feel about that 😭... But I was very happy when I saw the first episode of the second season!
01.01.23, 03:20 - Niki: Yeah know what you mean. Really hypt for the rest
01.01.23, 03:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you like it!
01.01.23, 03:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So why exactly did you go to this party?
01.01.23, 03:22 - Niki: We knew someone that was here and we want to see him but he left early so. I don't know really?
01.01.23, 03:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah... Ah, love those kind of situations 😅
01.01.23, 03:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is why I hate meeting up with people during a festival, you never fucking find them 😭
01.01.23, 03:25 - Niki: True its sucks at times but we out now
01.01.23, 03:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Better make the best of it! Going anywhere else after this?
01.01.23, 03:26 - Niki: Na just home and get some sleep. I am done for today.
01.01.23, 03:27 - Niki: Got something I want to ask you tomorrow pls ask me about "what did Killian ? "
01.01.23, 03:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay? Sure, I'll ask you tomorrow :)
01.01.23, 03:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any closer to going home or still waiting around at the party?
01.01.23, 03:28 - Niki: Na we are in the car
01.01.23, 03:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, nice!
01.01.23, 03:29 - Niki: Finally 🥳
01.01.23, 03:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's weird being at home. It feels like I never left
01.01.23, 03:30 - Niki: Yeah I know this feeling
01.01.23, 03:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It kind of feels like Norway was a dream
01.01.23, 03:32 - Niki: Yeah I know what you mean
01.01.23, 03:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: According to my family I changed a lot, kind of hard to tell though, it's just kinda weird
01.01.23, 03:32 - Niki: My friends told me the Same
01.01.23, 03:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I asked what they meant and the only answer they gave me was that I was more myself... Which is just a very vague thing to say 😅
01.01.23, 03:34 - Niki: My friends told me that I just changed and that I am more grown up I think. Don't really know what they mean with that to be honest.
01.01.23, 03:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... It's always hard to tell yourself I guess?
01.01.23, 03:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe once I meet up with friends they'll be able to tell me, kinda doubt it though
01.01.23, 03:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The _vibe_ has changed
01.01.23, 03:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is what they will say 😅
01.01.23, 03:36 - Niki: I mean some of your friends were with you up there
01.01.23, 03:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex yeah, but god knows we psychoanalyse everything yet still don't know shit about who we are 😂
01.01.23, 03:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any new years resolutions? I don't know why I'm asking, I don't do any myself but anyway
01.01.23, 03:39 - Niki: Not really I don't do things like that ever
01.01.23, 03:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think they're kinda pointless, you feel bad about not getting them a couple weeks after anyways
01.01.23, 03:42 - Niki: Yeah. I am going to sleep now. Hope you have a good night ❤️
01.01.23, 03:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sweet dreams ❤️
I'll be up a bit longer, the party my neighbours are having is in full swing 😅
01.01.23, 12:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good... Morning? Noon?
01.01.23, 12:52 - Niki: Good morning
01.01.23, 12:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've been awake for 2 hours yet I still don't know 😅
01.01.23, 12:53 - Niki: Know that feeling. I don't think I can be productive today so I just relax for today
01.01.23, 12:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, I have the opposite! I've been helping out cleaning up the place and all that, after this I'll probably start cleaning out my closet and all that
01.01.23, 12:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, before I forget!
01.01.23, 12:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You asked me to ask you about this?
01.01.23, 13:03 - Niki: Yeah I want to ask you? Or me and Alex got in a situation. Me and Alex went to pick up Killian friend of us after a party. Then we saw him and his first crush kiss and making out. Alex was really confused because Killian is the typ of person that does date or likes to start a relationship easily. Then Alex thought that Killian used the drunken State of the girl (Helena) and was disappointed in Killian. Then I said mabye there both drunk and just one think let to other. In the Ende we talk about at the party with out Killian and where really confused because Killian isn't the person to use somebody or get easily into a relationship. After we pick him up he explained that he ask her Multiple times if it was okay and that he has still feeling for her. But she also made out with someone else that night so we don't really know what to think of this situation it's weird.
01.01.23, 13:03 - Niki: Sorry for the wall of text 😁🙏
01.01.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay so basically he kissed a girl he still has feelings for and another girl at the same party?
01.01.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no, wait, SHE kissed someone else?
01.01.23, 13:06 - Niki: Yes
01.01.23, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhu... Okay, and was she drunk or not?
01.01.23, 13:07 - Niki: She was drunk and we think Killian to at the point where they made out but we are not sure about both of them
01.01.23, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If she was drunk, and even if she wasn't, I think the situation isn't that serious? They made out but I honestly doubt anything is going to come of this, other than maybe Killian getting his heart broken... It's hard to tell of course because I don't know either of them
01.01.23, 13:12 - Niki: Yeah we don't know either really but it was untypical for Killian. We hope they get together or it was just a type thing to be honest
01.01.23, 13:12 - Niki: Yeah that get us guess yesterday while we were at the this boring party of them
01.01.23, 13:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a pretty eventful party?
01.01.23, 13:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess only time will tell!
01.01.23, 13:14 - Niki: Yeah kinda
01.01.23, 13:15 - Niki: How was your evening in the Ende.
01.01.23, 13:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was nice! A little bit boring, especially because it was only my cousin and I as the young ones. Everyone also left really early, but yeah, it was nice seeing some family again :)
01.01.23, 13:17 - Niki: Sounds like a lovely evening though.
01.01.23, 13:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was, guess I just wanted a little more excitement out of it, but I certainly enjoyed it!
01.01.23, 13:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm making plans for January with my parents now, any clue when you'd want to come here/go to France?
01.01.23, 13:20 - Niki: I go time after the 7 of January so mabye around there. My grandfather celebrat his 80 birthday so all of my family will be there.
01.01.23, 13:21 - Niki: And the we need to tell the other 2 when we come to France and hope that Aeneas and Anthony have some time
01.01.23, 13:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe we should ask them about that first
01.01.23, 13:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My parents are fully on board with you coming over and staying here... On 1 condition 😂... You have to help me study for my driver's exam 😂
01.01.23, 13:30 - Niki: No worrys got you 😘
01.01.23, 13:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, love that 😘
01.01.23, 15:13 - Niki: What's the trip with your cousin. Where you going?
01.01.23, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're going to watch a live recording of a tv show and we're making a weekend out of it in Brussels
01.01.23, 15:35 - Niki: Sounds nice what TV show
01.01.23, 15:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a show we have here to decide who's going to Eurovision for Belgium, should be funny 😁
01.01.23, 15:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My cousin and I love watching Eurovision, make an event out of it, just for shits and giggles, so this will be very nice :)
01.01.23, 15:41 - Niki: Nice do u hoth have a favorite in the show?
01.01.23, 15:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I honestly have no clue who is participating 😂
01.01.23, 15:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My cousin probably does... Wait, I'm gonna check who is participating and if I actually know anyone
01.01.23, 15:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out there's some big (for Belgium) names in there and a couple I've never even heard of! I'm always a fan of an underdog though, so I'll be rooting for Gala Dragot
01.01.23, 15:48 - Niki: Will listen to some of her  songs. Sounds interesting does she sing in Dutch, French or English?
01.01.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: English, but she only has 1 song on Spotify so far 😅
01.01.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One of the songs she will present on the show has a french title though, so I'm very curious what that's gonna be like!
01.01.23, 15:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like I said, I'm a fan of an underdog 😁, I know NOTHING about her 😂
01.01.23, 15:50 - Niki: I am rooting for her too allways for the underdog
01.01.23, 15:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love that, I'll let you know how she does then 😊
01.01.23, 17:26 - Niki: Okay in ragnarök I kinda start to like everybody 😊
01.01.23, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohh, how come, what happened?
01.01.23, 17:29 - Niki: I don't know everybody got there owe drive at they start to grow on me. Didn't expect to be this into the show
01.01.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The second season is just really good 😁
01.01.23, 17:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, they all definitely get some character growth/fleshing out in the second season and it benefits the series immensely!
01.01.23, 17:33 - Niki: Yeah it's great
01.01.23, 17:47 - Niki: What are your doing tonight?
01.01.23, 17:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing much, just trying to figure out what we're doing for dinner. What about you?
01.01.23, 17:49 - Niki: Watching ragnarök and chill. I also thinking about what I want to eat for dinner
01.01.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice. I just made a deal with my mom to not be forced to go on a walk right now
01.01.23, 17:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's absolutely ridiculous
01.01.23, 17:56 - Niki: Well good job I guess
01.01.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
01.01.23, 17:57 - Niki: Beautiful i love it 🥰
01.01.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Bahaha, of course you do
01.01.23, 17:58 - Niki: You can tell your mum I am thankful
01.01.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, I will 😂
01.01.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Random question, I'm supposed to cook while they're on a walk, wanna call while I do that?
01.01.23, 17:59 - Niki: Sure Sounds nice
01.01.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Awesome, I'll call you in like 2 minutes then 😊
01.01.23, 18:53 - Niki: Sorry i don't know
01.01.23, 18:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahaha
01.01.23, 18:53 - Niki: I am really bad at social thinks
01.01.23, 18:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's okayyy
01.01.23, 18:54 - Niki: I am also getting red right now
01.01.23, 18:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was adorable actually
01.01.23, 18:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute
01.01.23, 18:55 - Niki: Thx you too 🥰
01.01.23, 18:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you just get awkward because of my parents or just because you had to find something to talk about?
01.01.23, 18:57 - Niki: Both I think but I don't know i just little weird sometimes
01.01.23, 18:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's okay, I get that 😊
01.01.23, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will keep saying it's cute though, be prepared for that ;)
01.01.23, 18:59 - Niki: Will get red at times but sure. I am prepared for it
01.01.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Great!
01.01.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just out of curiosity, if I'm done eating and I get away from my parents, do you want to still call or not? I can find something to talk about so you don't have to worry about that :) (but also if you don't want to I totally understand that)
01.01.23, 19:02 - Niki: We can sure sounds lovely 🥰
01.01.23, 19:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, give me 5 minutes 😘
01.01.23, 19:02 - Niki: No worrys
02.01.23, 13:50 - Niki: How is unpacking going so far?
02.01.23, 13:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.01.23, 13:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.01.23, 13:53 - Niki: Looks like a lot hope you can find some space in your closet
02.01.23, 13:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, yeah, that's gonna be alright, I already have a big box of clothes I'm throwing away
02.01.23, 13:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's so much 😭
02.01.23, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But good news! I'm seeing one of my friends in an hour!! 🥳
02.01.23, 13:55 - Niki: Hey that nice mabye they can help you a bit
02.01.23, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, we're going on a walk near their place because she's studying mathematics and needs a break 😅
02.01.23, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's alright, I'll manage! I could probably do it in 2 hours or less if I really tried 😅
02.01.23, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you doing today?
02.01.23, 13:57 - Niki: Okay I understand that. Hope she can get her mind of math and relax a bit
02.01.23, 13:57 - Niki: My family came back so unpacking and going to other family members
02.01.23, 13:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, we're doing similar things today then!
02.01.23, 13:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I should probably get back to unpacking... 🥲
02.01.23, 13:59 - Niki: Hope you can finish it fast ☺️
02.01.23, 14:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks 😘
02.01.23, 18:58 - Niki: How was your day did you unpack everything?
02.01.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My day was pretty good, didn't unpack everything but I'll get there... Maybe tomorrow! Did go on a walk and saw Jinte which was very nice, so I feel quite good about today. How about you?
02.01.23, 19:05 - Niki: Sounds nice 🥰. Me and my parents went too our aunt for coffee and cake. But we stayed for too longe so we are eating out now. It's quite nice a lot of drama on my aunt side her boyfriend cheated and i didn't know about so I got the full drama story today.
02.01.23, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds very interesting! Hope she wasn't too affected by it though, but sounds like you had quite the entertainment today!
02.01.23, 19:11 - Niki: Yeah it was quit entertaining but I think she is over him and she is dating someone new. But I think it's hard at that age to find someone you like.
02.01.23, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh that's good! How old is she? I'm sure you can find someone at any age, but it definitely does get harder
02.01.23, 19:17 - Niki: Yeah she is 50 something I don't really know.
02.01.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, she's not that old!
02.01.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom says hi btw 😊
02.01.23, 19:21 - Niki: My mom and dad can't read English well but they stare at my screen while I read and it's quit funny
02.01.23, 19:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, my parents understand everything and I'm in between them on the couch, it's kinda funny. They're pretty preoccupied with their series though
02.01.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And they respect my privacy not to read anything, but sometimes my mom gets curious so she asks who I'm chatting with
02.01.23, 19:25 - Niki: Nice. My family doesn't really care about privacy. We know everything about each other. I told my mum about us and she said she geussed that we were together. I think I am really obivous sometimes
02.01.23, 19:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think both my parents and I like to be on our own sometimes, so privacy is pretty important I guess? How are you so obvious about that though?? I keep getting surprised by how oblivious I clearly must have been 😂
02.01.23, 19:32 - Niki: Yeah I don't know. i was  surprised because I thought she didn't know.  But my dad had no idea
02.01.23, 19:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's kinda funny
02.01.23, 19:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently, my dad told me later, he wasn't as surprised as he showed when I first told him. Apparently he saw it coming?? I don't know how but anyway, my mom was much more surprised
02.01.23, 19:37 - Niki: Quite the opposite of my family reaction. Love that
02.01.23, 19:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Once again, complementary 😁
02.01.23, 19:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any other plans tonight?
02.01.23, 19:40 - Niki: We need to visit my sister in 30 min and watch dart with my family. I don't really care but my family is really into it around Christmas every year
02.01.23, 19:40 - Niki: What about you?
02.01.23, 19:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dart can be interesting to watch, but not a whole evening of it I think! I'm just gonna watch some tv with my parents I think, nothing special
02.01.23, 19:43 - Niki: Sounds relaxing. My phone has only 3% left and we are still out for 1 more hour😢
02.01.23, 19:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh... That's too bad! Your phone is definitely gonna die soon 🥲
02.01.23, 19:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe 1 question before that happens. I said when I'm free in the other chat 15-30 so when do you want to come visit?
02.01.23, 19:46 - Niki: 15 if I can make it but I am not sure. Will tell you tomorrow
02.01.23, 19:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing, just let me know :)
02.01.23, 19:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now enjoy the night with your family! ❤️
02.01.23, 19:47 - Niki: You too
02.01.23, 21:06 - Niki: Finally back home and watching dart now with my family 😅.
02.01.23, 21:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know, every time you mention darts I want to check how Belgium is doing so now I'm gonna look it up
02.01.23, 21:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're in the semi finals with Dancing fucking Dimi??? 😂
02.01.23, 21:11 - Niki: xD my family already got a back up plan if Germany is out. They are switching to the Belgium player
02.01.23, 21:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahaha, love that
02.01.23, 21:12 - Niki: The name 😂 but yeah he is good I think
02.01.23, 21:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's his nickname apparently, he dances when he's doing well 😂
02.01.23, 21:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.01.23, 21:16 - Niki: The advertisements are so bad in Germany like 0 acting skills. It's kinda sad and funny at the same time😅
02.01.23, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Haven't had any ads yet, but apparently one of the commentators got their car stolen on new years, so fun story about that I guess?
02.01.23, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also love that it's Belgium vs Holland, our arch nemesis in any competition
02.01.23, 21:18 - Niki: I hate Holland too now
02.01.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Showing solidarity with me or for another reason?
02.01.23, 21:20 - Niki: Solidarity but I will find a reason soon or later
02.01.23, 21:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cute
02.01.23, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're definitely gonna lose this one though 😅
02.01.23, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They've played against each other a bunch of times and we've never won
02.01.23, 21:22 - Niki: I believe in the Belgium dancer
02.01.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, I guess I'll have to believe in it to see it, so I'll believe as well
02.01.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (Though statistics do say something else)
02.01.23, 21:24 - Niki: It's like the troll move you just need to believe in it then it will happen
02.01.23, 21:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That was what I was quoting 😅
02.01.23, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The Dutch player is so cocky... God I can't stand him
02.01.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The hatred against the Dutch is in my blood but this man gets the blood from underneath my nails
02.01.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I definitely did not directly translate a Flemish saying... No)
02.01.23, 21:28 - Niki: Soo I hate him too now. 😊
02.01.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Lovely 😊
02.01.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're talking about cyber bullying of players now. Never realised the darts scene was that cutthroat 😅
02.01.23, 21:32 - Niki: I never realized it's such a serious game
02.01.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Me neither
02.01.23, 21:34 - Niki: I mean Belgium vs Holland is more than just darts so 🤔
02.01.23, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's true, but apparently it's just in general that they get a lot of hate on social media. I seriously never knew people cared so much 😅
02.01.23, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But the Belgium-Holland match certainly will lead to a lot of hate on both sides 😅
02.01.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not my parents and I trying to figure out how the game works right now... 😁
02.01.23, 21:41 - Niki: My dad explains the game every year again. so if I have questions just ask I try to help 😊
02.01.23, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay... I think we got most of it, but how many legs are there to a set?
02.01.23, 21:45 - Niki: 3
02.01.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, thanks!
02.01.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have to say, Belgian ads aren't that bad... Pleasantly surprised
02.01.23, 21:50 - Niki: German ads are soo bad. there either for poker, fitness or insurance
02.01.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We have ads for cars, holidays and all that, pretty much never for insurance, rarely for poker and yeah... We do have fitness ads
02.01.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basic fit, you always get a free backpack
02.01.23, 21:52 - Niki: Sounds way better than the German ads
02.01.23, 21:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, could be worse I guess? American ads are out of this world though
02.01.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like, batshit crazy
02.01.23, 21:54 - Niki: The political ads are the worse on in the world
02.01.23, 21:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh god yes... Awful
02.01.23, 21:57 - Niki: I love the fan song in the back
02.01.23, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love the guy wearing a hotdog suit
02.01.23, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The audience is really entertaining though
02.01.23, 22:00 - Niki: Yeah I think the fans are great except the cyper bulling
02.01.23, 22:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The atmosphere there looks amazing!
02.01.23, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're also shooting fireworks again in my neighbourhood... Until when???
02.01.23, 22:02 - Niki: Crazy maybe some kids that found some or got some leftovers
02.01.23, 22:03 - Niki: The mood of my family is now on the down side they are kinda disappointed
02.01.23, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I sure hope they're not kids but yeah probably
02.01.23, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How come? The German player is doing quite good no?
02.01.23, 22:05 - Niki: Yeah he is 2 vs 4 and they need 6 to win
02.01.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 2 vs 4?? It's still 1 vs 1 here 😭
02.01.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay yeah, I understand the disappointment then 😅
02.01.23, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out somehow we were watching with a delay??
02.01.23, 22:10 - Niki: Yeah sorry for spoiling it
02.01.23, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, thanks for that actually, we didn't realise it 😂
02.01.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will say this in advance, and I'm very sorry about it, but if both Germany and Belgium are out, I will 100% root for the Englishman
02.01.23, 22:13 - Niki: No worries, I will also root for the Englishman.fuck the Holland guy
02.01.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also, have you ever heard of the word Schilderwald?
02.01.23, 22:15 - Niki: Yeah
02.01.23, 22:16 - Niki: It meas something like  you have way too many signs on the road or in a short way
02.01.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom bought a book on 'hygge' and for some reason that was in there
02.01.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So she wanted me to ask you about it
02.01.23, 22:19 - Niki: Love that I could help
02.01.23, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks 🥰
02.01.23, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm afraid... It's over for Germany...
02.01.23, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My condolences
02.01.23, 22:21 - Niki: Now we are on the Belgium side
02.01.23, 22:21 - Niki: Thanks 🥲
02.01.23, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love that, I hope we don't disappoint
02.01.23, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are you guys gonna watch the next match as well?
02.01.23, 22:30 - Niki: Yeah I think so but we are tired so I don't know how long
02.01.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair, same for us probably
02.01.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If we do really bad it we will not watch for long at all 😂
02.01.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The way they fuck up names in English is always funny to me
02.01.23, 22:35 - Niki: He has the moves though 😅
02.01.23, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That he does 😂
02.01.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is it too early to lose hope?
02.01.23, 22:41 - Niki: Maybe
02.01.23, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That answer inspired absolutely no hope in me so I will say 'no'
02.01.23, 22:42 - Niki: 😅 well it looks like it to be honest
02.01.23, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay okay, I have faith in his skills again
02.01.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind
02.01.23, 22:43 - Niki: I believe again too
02.01.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why can't he be consistent??
02.01.23, 22:44 - Niki: It needs to be a rollercoaster of emotion
02.01.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If that's what they're going for, they're doing a great job 😂
02.01.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have faithhhh
02.01.23, 22:45 - Niki: 170 omg
02.01.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yessss
02.01.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know what, Belgium is inconsistent as fuck, so I will blame his inconsistency on that
02.01.23, 22:48 - Niki: Love the hate for the inconsistency I have it two
02.01.23, 22:48 - Niki: Too
02.01.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just learning to live with it
02.01.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any clue what trebbleless visits are?
02.01.23, 22:53 - Niki: No idea
02.01.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love the sportsmanship of the Dutch... 😑
02.01.23, 22:55 - Niki: 😁 Well he is just a nice guy
02.01.23, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, yes, he just _loves_ getting close and cosy with his opponent
02.01.23, 22:56 - Niki: It's when they it the triple 5 instead of the 20
02.01.23, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohhhh, thanks!!
02.01.23, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And... I lost hope again
02.01.23, 23:00 - Niki: It looks really bad to be honest. But there is a slight hope left
02.01.23, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's just the difference in moods for me, the Dutch guy is cocky as hell and the Belgian guy looks so nervous 😭
02.01.23, 23:03 - Niki: I know what you mean feel the same way
02.01.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What an arsehole 😠
02.01.23, 23:06 - Niki: True he is a cunt
02.01.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is the rivalry peaking
02.01.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is gonna be so slow now 😭
02.01.23, 23:08 - Niki: 😂 I love that the hate between the countrys is universal in ever think
02.01.23, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's probably universal but goddamn it, we really can't stand them 😂
02.01.23, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh, so, we're rooting for England tomorrow? 🙃
02.01.23, 23:09 - Niki: I found a reason my reason to hate them now
02.01.23, 23:09 - Niki: Yeah my mum also was like we are for the English player now
02.01.23, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let's go 😂
02.01.23, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, the Belgian guy did just hit the highest set average in the competition though
02.01.23, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The Belgian commentators keep saying to keep calm, everything is still possible and all that... Sureeee...
02.01.23, 23:14 - Niki: 😅 Well it's true but very unlikely.
02.01.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know it's possible but I'm Belgian... It's better to expect the worst
02.01.23, 23:15 - Niki: 😅 At least you won't be that disappointed when he loses
02.01.23, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I have no faith in Belgium in any competition we enter, some shit always happens that throws us off
02.01.23, 23:18 - Niki: I mean the other guy is a real asshole with his foot and the standing right behind him
02.01.23, 23:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, but he should be used to it by now, they've played against each other a bunch of times
02.01.23, 23:19 - Niki: Yeah still I would hate him
02.01.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I'm not talking just darts, literally any competition
02.01.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, 100%
02.01.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've accepted our loss
02.01.23, 23:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Speedrun the 5 stages of grief
02.01.23, 23:27 - Niki: Yeah it's kinda over 0 vs 4. My mum already went ot bed and I think I will go too soon
02.01.23, 23:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably a good idea
02.01.23, 23:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not like it's gonna last much longer though
02.01.23, 23:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Give it 15 minutes and it's over 😂
02.01.23, 23:28 - Niki: Yeah but I can't watch it anymore I will head to bed
02.01.23, 23:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're right
02.01.23, 23:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
02.01.23, 23:29 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
02.01.23, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We were slaughtered... How sad. 6-0 😭
02.01.23, 23:42 - Niki: We get our revenge tomorrow
02.01.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes
03.01.23, 13:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How/what are you doing today?
03.01.23, 13:13 - Niki: I am doing fine just a little procrastination. My grandfather has his 80 birthday today and we go there for coffee around 15. What are you doing and how are you doing?
03.01.23, 13:14 - Niki: I think i can come around the 15 to Belgium if everything works out btw
03.01.23, 13:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, same on the procrastinating :)
Have fun at the party!
I'm doing alright, just going to clean up more and tonight we're visiting some family for dinner
03.01.23, 13:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was thinking maybe the 16th would be better for 2 reasons: 
1) the 15th is the last day my family is drinking and it is also the new years reception that day which means free drinks -> they will try to drink you under the table for free
2) I just get back from the trip that day
So maybe the 16th is better?
03.01.23, 13:18 - Niki: Yeah sounds better not to get drunk the first night I would be there
03.01.23, 13:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... Maybe 😂
03.01.23, 15:48 - Niki: My grandfather is taking about politics again with my uncle its kinda funny how they get so into the topic in like 10 min. How is your cleaning going?
03.01.23, 15:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, gotta love politics at family gatherings! My cleaning is... Not going 😅
I'm in full procrastination mode
03.01.23, 15:50 - Niki: Hope you get out of this mode at some point today
03.01.23, 15:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda doubt it, but we'll see. I still have 3 hours before we go to my family 😅
03.01.23, 15:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Other than the politics, is it a nice party?
03.01.23, 15:52 - Niki: Yeah really nice even though I am the only one in my age group
03.01.23, 15:53 - Niki: You can procrastination for 3 more hours 🥳
03.01.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, yeah, I know how you feel
03.01.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yesss... I definitely shouldn't... Ugh...
03.01.23, 15:56 - Niki: Yeah but it's so confy☺️
03.01.23, 15:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.01.23, 15:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is...
03.01.23, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I forgot that these particular family members are also clients of my parents... It's all about accounting
03.01.23, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although there's some drama, but still 😅
03.01.23, 18:36 - Niki: Business and family dinner sounds really interesting 😅
03.01.23, 18:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, not gonna lie, the whole story about their landlord is really interesting, but I really don't care about their inventory 😅
03.01.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Though they do apparently have a darts club with about 30 members that frequents the bar, so that's kinda cool?
03.01.23, 18:40 - Niki: Sounds nice at times and boring at others but sounds interesting over all
03.01.23, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could be worse for sure, I just thought their kid was gonna be here too so we could play some games or something like that, now I'm just following along. I'll probably learn some things though so I shouldn't complain too much
03.01.23, 21:41 - Niki: I watch the last 2 episodes of ragnarök now. i need more episodes. The ending was just some much questions about what gone happen next
03.01.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes... I have no clue if there's gonna be a next season though 😅
03.01.23, 21:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's gonna be a third and final season apparently but god only knows when
03.01.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, rather that than the writers just dragging it out and writing a bad storyline for money
03.01.23, 21:57 - Niki: Yeah true hate it when the drag it for too longe and nothing makes real sense anymore
03.01.23, 21:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, there's too much of that these days
03.01.23, 22:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just got home from my family, the stories I heard of when they used to go out in their youth are crazy! So many fights 😅
03.01.23, 22:04 - Niki: My grandmother on my mom's side told me 4 days ago I think. That my dad sang a lot when he was drinking and smoking out side with his buddies. that they already knew that my mom was home before she opened the door because of that
03.01.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahha, yeah, it's sometimes worse than that. 1 story I really was 'impressed' by was when my dad and some friends wanted to go out and my mom was gonna drive them. She stayed in the car and was gonna sleep while they partied. Not even half an hour later my dad came back, couldn't walk on his left leg anymore and they had to call the ambulance for one of his friends 😅
03.01.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently that was normal back then???
03.01.23, 22:08 - Niki: Sounds not good for ones health but sure why not 😁
03.01.23, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahah, yeah no 😂
03.01.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They did tell me about something interesting I wanna try though, apparently there's a night restaurant in the city and it's supposed to be really good? Sounds fun to try 😁
03.01.23, 22:11 - Niki: Yeah sounds interesting never heard of a night restaurant before but sound nice
03.01.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's pretty self-explanatory, it's not open during the day which is probably why I've never gone there before
03.01.23, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're watching the darts finals now, my dad wants to see the Dutch guy lose
03.01.23, 22:23 - Niki: Feel the same way
03.01.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He's an arsehole and I'd love to see him trip and miss 😅
03.01.23, 23:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Revenge was served 😁
03.01.23, 23:50 - Niki: Good night ❤️
03.01.23, 23:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
04.01.23, 12:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna drive a car for the first time in 5 months... God save me
04.01.23, 12:58 - Niki: You got this 😊
04.01.23, 14:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out driving is like riding a bicycle, you don't really forget how to do it 😁
04.01.23, 14:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How are you doing?
04.01.23, 14:15 - Niki: That's great 😊
04.01.23, 14:15 - Niki: Taking with aeneas
04.01.23, 14:15 - Niki: Talking
04.01.23, 14:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, have fun! Tell him I said hi or something 😊
04.01.23, 14:17 - Niki: Hey back and he wants to call now
04.01.23, 14:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's fun!
04.01.23, 14:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tell him to call me sometime, I'll follow my cat if he wants it 😁
04.01.23, 14:36 - Niki: Told him he wants to call you today I think but he will write you frist if u got time for sure. It was nice talking to him. He also said that Norway was like a dream to him was really nice 😊
04.01.23, 18:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, he sent me a message! Norway really was like a dream to all of us huh? 😅
04.01.23, 18:39 - Niki: Seems like it. How was your day and the drive?
04.01.23, 18:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My day was pretty good, at the hairdresser now. The drive also went pretty well! How was your day?
04.01.23, 18:42 - Niki: Nice but I procrastination a lot today so I need to work now to get alest something done.
04.01.23, 18:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah yeah... I feel that, good luck with what you need to do then!! You can do it 😘
04.01.23, 23:01 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
04.01.23, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
Just got off the phone with Aeneas btw, was fun to talk to him again 😊
05.01.23, 09:40 - Niki: What did you talk about with aeneas? How was the hairdresser everything went well?
05.01.23, 09:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We talked a bit about everything, showed him my cat as well and then he talked to my parents for a couple of minutes. Hairdresser went well!
05.01.23, 09:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you end up being productive yesterday?
05.01.23, 09:50 - Niki: Yeah kinda not really but it's okay. What are you doing today?
05.01.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: More cleaning! Well, if I don't procrastinate...
05.01.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you have time to call sometime today or tomorrow?
05.01.23, 09:52 - Niki: Sure today around 15?
05.01.23, 09:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's perfect!
05.01.23, 14:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Call me when you want
05.01.23, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: All the fucking sauces
05.01.23, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
05.01.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
05.01.23, 18:43 - Niki: I get the names of 80% of them but still so much sauces
05.01.23, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes... Also a lot of the names make no sense whatsoever 😅
05.01.23, 23:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
05.01.23, 23:18 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
06.01.23, 12:44 - Niki: Hey what are u doing today? How were the fries yesterday?
06.01.23, 13:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hey! I just went to the store to buy paint! The fries were amazing, what are you doing today?
06.01.23, 13:26 - Niki: Did some work on the paper then I went out with my dad because he need my help with some measurements. Now it's back to the paper until my sister comes home. What are u plans for the rest of the day?
06.01.23, 13:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cleaning my room, trying to get rid of my closet and all that. After that Celine is coming over to pick up her stuff from Norway. Then movie night with my aunt and Pieter!
06.01.23, 13:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with the paper 😊
06.01.23, 13:30 - Niki: Sounds nice hope you don't get distracted that much while cleaning you room ☺️
06.01.23, 13:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think that's probably too much to ask, but one can hope! 🙃
06.01.23, 16:15 - Niki: How is cleaning going ? Was Celine already there and got here stuff?
06.01.23, 16:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cleaning isn't going too well, but I'll get through it! Celine is coming in about 20 minutes. How's the paper going? Your sister is arriving later tonight right?
06.01.23, 16:22 - Niki: Paper isn't going well neither but I will get through it too. Yeah she is arriving at 19:25 and I need to pick her up from the train station.
06.01.23, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Celine just left, turns out the whole 'norway felt like a dream' thing is universal! She's doing good though, leaving for Ireland in February.
Cheers for the paper, you'll be fine 😊
06.01.23, 17:23 - Niki: She is going to Irland nice to hear. She gone Studie there or for what she gone go there. The papaer will be fine I think 😅
06.01.23, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's doing her internship there at a headhunting firm, should be interesting for her! 
I have full faith in your ability to do the paper :)
06.01.23, 21:00 - Niki: Pick up my sister from the train station and eat dinner together now we watching Kaleidoscope. How is your movie night going?
06.01.23, 21:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your sister doing? Happy to be back? Kaleidoscope is pretty good, I hope you enjoy it! Movienight is going good, Barry keeps barking at the most random things though, but it's kinda funny.
06.01.23, 21:16 - Niki: She doing great but 6 hours train ride was tiring.
06.01.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, travel is always tiring. Hope she has a good night sleep tonight 😊
06.01.23, 23:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
06.01.23, 23:45 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
07.01.23, 11:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Excited for the birthday party? Anything else you're doing today?
07.01.23, 11:45 - Niki: At the party right now it's nice. I talk a lot with my aunt about France and Belgium. Nothing plan after 17:30
07.01.23, 11:53 - Niki: What are you planning to do today?
07.01.23, 13:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does she know a lot about Belgium and France? 
I just went driving, went alright, almost had an accident though... But it's alright! Tonight Laura and her family are coming over, other than that just cleaning up again.
07.01.23, 13:05 - Niki: Yeah she went on a few trips to Belgium and France. Almost accidents happen so often I don't count anymore. Well you can procrastination until they come over and have a great time then 😅
07.01.23, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's cool! Yeah no, this one was 100% my fault, should have kept an eye out and I just didn't see the car in time 😅
Nah, this time I have no chance of procrastinating ... My mom is gonna supervise 😅
07.01.23, 13:08 - Niki: Well at least you gone make some progress with supervision.
07.01.23, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's true!
07.01.23, 17:08 - Niki: The birthday party is finally over I love them a lot but longer than 3 hours is hard. How is your day going?
07.01.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I totally get that, my family is amazing but sometimes I can't stand being around them 😅
I feel like I accomplished something, but I have so much left to do 😅.
We got rid of probably 1/3 of my closet though, so that's good!
07.01.23, 17:18 - Niki: Yeah, nice that you've been productive. For the rest. Starting is the hardest thing allways. You can relax with Laura later 🥰
07.01.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope she doesn't have too much energy or I'll be dead 😭
Love her, but I'm tired 😅
07.01.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: These are moments where I'd absolutely love to just cuddle with you on a couch and do nothing for the rest of the day
07.01.23, 17:26 - Niki: Same wish you were here now. You the only person I am never sick of ❤️
07.01.23, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A bit more than a week 😘
08.01.23, 00:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Laura left just now, I am so tired 😅
08.01.23, 00:21 - Niki: Now u can relax ☺️
08.01.23, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, sleep! I had fun though, but a bit too much for today 😅
08.01.23, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
08.01.23, 00:24 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
08.01.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are your plans for today?
08.01.23, 11:45 - Niki: I am just resting and writing some text for the paper. What about you?
08.01.23, 11:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going driving again, then preparations for painting my room, nothing special
08.01.23, 11:55 - Niki: Preparing for the painting sounds like a lot what you need to do for that?
08.01.23, 11:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not that much honestly, just have to get rid of the remaining things in my room and then wash my walls
08.01.23, 12:02 - Niki: Yeah okay that's not that much. If it gets boring just write me I will gladly entertain you 😊
08.01.23, 12:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll definitely keep that in mind 😊
08.01.23, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My room is super empty and it looks weird. We also just went driving and it went great! How's your day going?
08.01.23, 16:52 - Niki: Great going out now with Alex to a friend.
08.01.23, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun!
09.01.23, 00:14 - Niki: Finally home 😅

How was the call with Alex yesterday?
09.01.23, 11:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with not procrastinating then ;)
Just for fun, tell Alex I said hi 😁 and have fun at the bday!
I'm just working on my room and doing some administration for my internship today. The call with Alex was fun, but we both stayed up until 2:30 because of it 😅
09.01.23, 17:17 - Niki: I am at my friend's apartment now and we eat burger to night hope the get good. How is your room working out? Did everything go well with the internship?
09.01.23, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Burgers are nice! No clue what we're eating tonight... 🧐

09.01.23, 18:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's hanging out with your friends? What do you guys do when you're hanging out?

10.01.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning 😊
What are you up to today?
10.01.23, 11:47 - Niki: Good morning ☺️Relaxing with my friends in his apartment. At 14/15 I drive to my friend who's birthday is today. What about you?
10.01.23, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah! You told me about that yesterday! Have fun! 
I'm painting my room today, then driving lessons with my grandpa and meeting up with Celine
10.01.23, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you manage to teach them Yanosh? And if so, did they get it?
10.01.23, 11:53 - Niki: We didn't play. We played monopoly and I won but monopoly is not really funny 🥲.
10.01.23, 11:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, maybe next time! Monopoly is funny if you just fuck with people though 😁
10.01.23, 18:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Never knew watching Alex create a Tinder profile would be this interesting 😂... So much unnecessary information and then "oh my god there's so many pretty people"
10.01.23, 19:15 - Niki: Yeah tinder is crazy we got one friend who has a account and sometimes we swipe together for fun. After that he meet some of the people and there were interesting
10.01.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex already had an account in the past but deleted the app, so had to make a new profile. There's so many things you have to fill in?? Like your astrology sign?? She's met some people on there before but it's usually not that interesting, at least hasn't been in the past
11.01.23, 00:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So much newfound respect for painters holy shit. I don't mind doing it, but I really don't have the patience for this 😅
How's your evening going?
11.01.23, 00:49 - Niki: Sound like a lot of work. How long do you need to work on it? Nights going great played some wizard and went out for ramen. Then we talk a lot about university stuff and some stories with his friends from university. I think we go back now and sleep soon. I am really tried to be honest 😅
11.01.23, 00:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's better than it looks, if I could just stay concentrated I could have finished much earlier for today 😅
Sounds like a nice night! I hope you get back soon then, get some good sleep 😊
11.01.23, 01:28 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
11.01.23, 01:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
11.01.23, 16:12 - Niki: What are you plans for today? How is the dryed paint looking?
11.01.23, 16:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just taking a small break from painting today and visiting my grandpa. What & how are you doing?
11.01.23, 16:48 - Niki: I am doing okay just a lot of social interaction. I am kinda tired but it's okay. Back at my friend's apartment. Sleeping there for the night. They want to eat out at place they found in the last month's.
11.01.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, yeah, social battery is drained?
11.01.23, 16:50 - Niki: Yeah did way to much the last week 😅
11.01.23, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you don't have too exciting plans for the weekend so you can rest up? 😅
11.01.23, 16:59 - Niki: Yeah I got nothing planned but if somebody ask I would probably say yeah to anything 😅
11.01.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's valid, probably same
11.01.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I kind of miss social interaction now I'm back home
11.01.23, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm really good at being on my own, but I forgot how much time it gives me to think
11.01.23, 17:04 - Niki: Got some advantages and disadvantages at times
11.01.23, 17:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I think this time it's more disadvantages but it's alright
11.01.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You are (probably) massively screwed
11.01.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad and aunt may or may not decide to drink anyway next week
11.01.23, 22:43 - Niki: Okay I think I will be fine
11.01.23, 23:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
11.01.23, 23:51 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
12.01.23, 11:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any plans for today?
12.01.23, 11:23 - Niki: Just the paper and relaxing to be honest.  What about you? Planning the trip with Laura?
12.01.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: More painting and meeting up with a friend from school, kind of last minute but nice nonetheless! The trip this weekend is fully planned so that's nice :)
Enjoy the relaxing day! 😘
12.01.23, 21:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day been?
12.01.23, 22:09 - Niki: I procrastinating too much but now I work so I guess okay 😅. I talk with Aeneas about the trip and what's going on in Paris and what we could do there. What about you? How is your day going?
12.01.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
12.01.23, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Late night work... Ah, the joy!
I also talked to Aeneas today, we should probably start planning everything 😅
12.01.23, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a nice time meeting up with my friend at the library, she went on Erasmus in Germany actually!
12.01.23, 22:14 - Niki: Nice what were impression of Germany?
12.01.23, 22:14 - Niki: Looks good. Love to hear your voice 🥰
12.01.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She loved it! Also learnt German pretty well, it's really cool how fast she did that!
12.01.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well then, call me more often if you love hearing my voice that much 😜😘
13.01.23, 00:42 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
13.01.23, 00:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
13.01.23, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: More relaxing/paper today or any fun plans?
13.01.23, 11:57 - Niki: Paper and relaxing nothing new 🥲. What are your plans for today?
13.01.23, 11:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Painting the last walls (eureka), going driving again and maybe we'll go watch the annual christmas tree bonfire, but that depends on the weather. You'll get the paper done, slowly but surely ;)
13.01.23, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you like cheesecake?
13.01.23, 16:15 - Niki: Yeah. Do you like potato salad?
13.01.23, 16:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
13.01.23, 16:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My friend is making cheesecake and I really want some as well, that's what prompted the question
13.01.23, 16:17 - Niki: Ahh okay so you gone make some or you gone ask her if I can come over for some cake?
13.01.23, 16:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I'm probably gonna make some next week, it's my grandma's recipe
13.01.23, 18:18 - Niki: How was driving today and are you going to the  christmas tree burning?
13.01.23, 18:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Driving went okay, not as well as I wanted it to be but it was alright! We're not going to the bonfire, my mom is tired and my dad is meeting with a friend to play padel apparently. How's your day been?
13.01.23, 18:31 - Niki: What went wrong today while you were driving? Yeah was okay done some catching up with some old friends and procrastinating my work again.
13.01.23, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just didn't park as well as I'd like to, like I said, it's alright! Just some more practise! Catching up with friends is always fun, procrastinating isn't though 😅
13.01.23, 20:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to right now?
13.01.23, 20:53 - Niki: Watching Menace 2 Society was recommended from my friend.
13.01.23, 20:53 - Niki: What about you what are your plans?
13.01.23, 20:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's it about? I'm just watching tv, kinda bored
13.01.23, 20:55 - Niki: It's about a black kid growing up in LA at around 1980.
13.01.23, 20:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds interesting
13.01.23, 20:56 - Niki: Yeah it's actually pretty good.
13.01.23, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe I'll check it out sometime... I still have the whole movie list from in Bergen, I'll add it 😅
13.01.23, 20:57 - Niki: Oh yeah what's still on the list?
13.01.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me look at that... I think there's like 15 movies on there?
13.01.23, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have to start up my laptop first though... Cue the beeping 😭
13.01.23, 20:59 - Niki: Love the beeping did you bring it too a repair shop
13.01.23, 21:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I still have to do that, problem is that my laptop was bought for my parents' company so their repair guy has to do it for warranty purposes, so it might take a while 😅
13.01.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, the list:
Schindler's list
1917
Arrival
The Giver
Matrix 1
Interstellar
Slumdog millionaire
Dracula
Spaceball
The triangle of sadness
12 monkeys
Alien 2
Seven
Menace 2 society
13.01.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Less movies than I thought honestly
13.01.23, 21:02 - Niki: Still a lot of good movies to watch on the list
13.01.23, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, for sure! Have to get around to watching them all though, that's gonna take a while
13.01.23, 21:05 - Niki: For sure it's great to procrastinate with the movies
13.01.23, 21:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really can't afford procrastinating more than I already do 😭
13.01.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yes, this would be a great way to do so 😅
13.01.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although I usually easily get bored watching movies though, but I guess that depends on the movie
13.01.23, 21:09 - Niki: Yeah kinda same but I just do some all night working and i will get it done
13.01.23, 21:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I could do the same... But god knows I do not want my mom to nag at me because of it 😅
13.01.23, 21:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you get the tire for your car? I heard that it's taking a really long time for them in Belgium
13.01.23, 21:13 - Niki: Yeah got the tire no worrys. It took a week to get though.
13.01.23, 21:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, it only took a week? That's a relief. I know some people that have been waiting for 3 weeks
13.01.23, 21:15 - Niki: Crazy but yeah it was quit fast to be honest.
13.01.23, 21:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good
13.01.23, 21:17 - Niki: I am done with the movie it's great but the ending is really sad. It's like kids from 1995 same energy
13.01.23, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just found out I still have to fill in a questionnaire about HVL... Guess that's what I'm doing now!
13.01.23, 21:17 - Niki: From your university or from HVL?
13.01.23, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohhh, I see! Sounds nice but sad indeed
13.01.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: From mine, it's about the academic quality or something
13.01.23, 21:22 - Niki: Only good thinks about Norway and HVL right. Mabye the courses were a little bit easier than at home 😊
13.01.23, 21:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course! The courses were a little easier yeah, but that's what happens when you have approximately 10 hours for classes a week 😁
13.01.23, 21:24 - Niki: Yeah it was quit nice to have that much free time though.
13.01.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very true, I never would have been able to experience that much if I had more classes
13.01.23, 21:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Watching another movie now or what are you going to do?
13.01.23, 21:26 - Niki: I think back to working on the paper but mabye another movie😁
13.01.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, you should probably work on the paper though :) but yeahhh, I get it
13.01.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would you be more motivated to work if you were calling someone that was also working? Just out of curiosity
13.01.23, 21:28 - Niki: I mean we can of you want too
13.01.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... do you want to?
13.01.23, 21:28 - Niki: Yeah

14.01.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So turns out my white walls are shit 😅😭
Anyway, how's your day looking?
14.01.23, 12:13 - Niki: What you mean with your wall. Is the paint bad or did you make a mistake? My mom is persistent on me bring presents to your parents so we went shopping for a plant and a pot for the plant. Can send you a picture later if you want to see it? Now we are grocery shopping for a 1 hour and 30 min. I can't anymore 🥲. Alex wants to do something tonight so we plan to go somewhere. How are you traveling to Brussels  and when do you go with your cousin?
14.01.23, 12:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not sure what went wrong honestly... It just looks really patchy after 2 layers, which is shouldn't... We're gonna try to fix it but yeah, doesn't look great for now! 
Please do send me a picture of the plant! I'm very curious what you got. Grocery shopping for over an hour??? Are you buying things for a whole army? 
Have fun with Alex! I leave for brussels in about 2 hours, we're taking a train :)
14.01.23, 12:27 - Niki: Yeah my mum ist really relaxed while shopping. Hope you get the wall fix. Have fun on the trip with your cousin.
14.01.23, 12:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like it! It's probably a nice state of mind though, not worried about time! We always rush grocery shopping, half an hour max. It leaves time for other things but sometimes I like exploring new things. I hope I'll get it fixed too! Thanks ❤️
14.01.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: God knows the underground is an adventure every single time... Brussels is shitty as hell, I doubt Paris can be worse
14.01.23, 16:16 - Niki: Did something in particular happen or just awful everything?
14.01.23, 16:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just a guy talking to us on the subway, kinda wholesome, he was just being nice but obviously drunk and my cousin felt uncomfortable. Other than that it's just filthy everywhere 😅
14.01.23, 16:19 - Niki: Sounds creepy to be honest but yeah most big cities are really dirty
14.01.23, 16:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just slightly, I wasn't too worried because he just really looked like he wanted to talk to someone. Apparently someone he knew just died and I think that's why he got so drunk and started 'spreading love' like he said in his own words
14.01.23, 16:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not a fan of most big cities
14.01.23, 21:23 - Niki: Okay me and Alex now sleep at our friends house and play minecraft and monopoly on ps4.
14.01.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Niceee, have fun!! I'm still at Eurosong, all the acts are so good 😭 how am I supposed to vote for any of them??
14.01.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Monopoly on PS4??
14.01.23, 21:34 - Niki: Yeah it's a shit version where you give the controller to the next person 😅.
14.01.23, 21:36 - Niki: What's Laura's opinion on the acts? Sounds nice hope you find some new good songs to listen too.
14.01.23, 21:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah no, it's my other cousin Cato! They like some of the acts a lot, both of us have a hard time deciding 😅
14.01.23, 21:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That... Sounds shit indeed but also really funny
14.01.23, 22:01 - Niki: Oh sorry Cato I thought yeah sorry 😅
14.01.23, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, my family is confusing, no worries 😂
15.01.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got back to the hotel, there was an afterparty but the third DJ kinda sucked so we left. How is Minecraft and monopoly?
15.01.23, 00:05 - Niki: Minecraft was kinda lame on ps4 but monopoly is fun because there are so angry because they lose even thought it's luck 😂
15.01.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, that sounds hilarious 😂, it's always great to play monopoly and have people get angry over it
15.01.23, 01:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
15.01.23, 01:14 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
15.01.23, 10:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On the train back home now. How was your evening yesterday?
15.01.23, 10:59 - Niki: Great how won the entire to the Eurovision song contest? Yeah yesterday... First I told Alex I want to be home around 23. We stay until 4 in the morning and I need to drive back because Alex was too tired. We wanted to sleep there first but he had no blankets so we said no. But it's was really nice though 😁
15.01.23, 11:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahha, 4am?? Damn, and you're awake already?? Glad you had fun! 
The winner isn't who I wanted to win, but I guess it's alright? His name is Gustaph, he wears fancy hats but he's definitely not gonna win. I'm kinda sad Gala Dragot didn't win, she had a great song! But it was fun so I don't really care :)
15.01.23, 11:46 - Niki: Yeah it was way to late. Sad that she didn't win you know what her song was called? What are your plans for today?
15.01.23, 11:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://open.spotify.com/track/5MCZNN35NryfsNdKH3UZtI?si=0Zu8kjJASTenwgrIh7Lb4w&utm_source=copy-link
15.01.23, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's the song, but I hope they put the performance video online soon as well, it looked really nice! 
(There's no such thing as too late when it's fun)
I'm just walking home now because there's apparently no bus driving right now. Then I'm cleaning up my room I guess, or trying to save my walls, idk. What are your plans?
15.01.23, 11:56 - Niki: Packing and relaxing for mw today. At 15:15 my parents friends come over and my uncle's family for some cake. I am so tried right now 🥲
15.01.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy the cake! Maybe you should take a nap if you're so tired??
15.01.23, 12:00 - Niki: Yeah probably gone do after lunch.
15.01.23, 12:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Great plan! 😊

06.02.23, 18:27 - Niki: Nice i try to remind you next time . I am save at home now 🥰
06.02.23, 18:39 - Niki: When did you have your week off from the intership?
06.02.23, 19:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm glad you got home safely! 🥰
06.02.23, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have off from the 8th to the 16th of April I think
06.02.23, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad was right, it's only 3 weeks. Completely forgot that Februari is a shorter month
06.02.23, 20:27 - Niki: Oh yeah well thats a pleasant surprise can't wait to see you in 3 weeks 😘
06.02.23, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, a really pleasant surprise! Also fun fact, my parents know nothing of what we were up to... They didn't even realise we slept in the same bed 😂😅
06.02.23, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was the drive btw?
06.02.23, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not too much trouble with bad Belgian drivers I hope 😜
06.02.23, 20:32 - Niki: Crazy i tough we were very obivous sometimes but well okay
06.02.23, 20:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Diese Nachricht wurde gelöscht.
06.02.23, 20:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, same, I have no clue how... Especially with the shower yesterday? But my mom asked if I actually slept in my own bed and when I told her I didn't she said "oh good, that would have been sad"
06.02.23, 20:33 - Niki: The drive was okay just kept thinking about you made me sad so I turned the Music louder and sang along. What did you do the rest of the day?
06.02.23, 20:34 - Niki: "That would have been sad" 🤣 I love your mom so much 😁
06.02.23, 20:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just watched some videos, tried not to think about you too much because it made me sad. Had a good conversation with my mom though, so I feel slightly better now 😊
Oh, and I got a start at the German course book!
06.02.23, 20:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, same, my dad too btw. They also wanted to know if you were comfortable here and if you felt like they were hospitable enough, love them loads
06.02.23, 20:35 - Niki: Yeah I now start to miss you a lot while laying in bed alone but I can type with so that's better
06.02.23, 20:36 - Niki: Yeah they were great pls tell them that I really like it there ☺️
06.02.23, 20:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's gonna be weird to sleep alone again tonight... I got used to having you around to cuddle with
06.02.23, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will!
06.02.23, 20:37 - Niki: Hope the book is of use because if you want to understand my parents and family the only option is german
06.02.23, 20:38 - Niki: Same. Only 3 weeks 😘
06.02.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope so too! I'm gonna try to study as much as possible before coming over in April! Speaking might still be difficult though 😅
06.02.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I already put it in my calendar 😘
06.02.23, 20:39 - Niki: No pressure I will translate everything you don't get 🥰
06.02.23, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, that reassures me (though I had no doubt you would) but still, I'd love to understand them myself, so I'll try my best!
06.02.23, 20:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I also had to tell you that we apparently locked Moustache in the garage all night... Whoops. He's alright though, laying against me on the couch now 😊
06.02.23, 20:50 - Niki: Sorry Moustache pet him for me a few times pls 😅
06.02.23, 20:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will do, I think he misses you too actually... He was looking for something before ;)
06.02.23, 20:51 - Niki: Sooo cute 🥰
06.02.23, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
06.02.23, 23:15 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
07.02.23, 09:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, I'm going to Brussels today :)
What are your plans?
Also, sleeping alone in my own bed was weird and cold :(
07.02.23, 10:28 - Niki: What are you going to do in Brussels? The walk with jinte an luna is Thursday right?
Some programming stuff and later meet up with Alex talk and we gone play some pool/billiard. Yeah sleeping alone sucks 🥲
07.02.23, 10:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, no, the walk is today! Thursday I'm meeting up with my cousin. (Too many plans, it gets confusing) 
Good luck with the programming and have fun with Alex! I don't know if I'll be able to respond until tonight if you send me anything, just so you know :(
07.02.23, 10:34 - Niki: Okay yeah I get confused. Tell jinte I said hi and have fun 🥰
07.02.23, 10:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will! If it's not too weird, tell Alex I said hi as well 😊
07.02.23, 10:40 - Niki: Will do no worrys 🥰
07.02.23, 13:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If we die or get lost, know that it was Jinte's fault...
07.02.23, 13:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Child does not know the way
07.02.23, 13:05 - Niki: I trust jinte else save yourself first
07.02.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... I'll let you know if I safely arrive back to civilization
07.02.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have survived... Somehow. We planned on walking 10km... We did at least double... I hate Jinte
07.02.23, 17:04 - Niki: xD
07.02.23, 17:05 - Niki: But atleast your good now how was it something interesting you talked about?
07.02.23, 17:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am so happy to sit down on the train now 😭
Yeah, it was nice, especially to see Luna again after so long! Talked a lot about DnD actually and now I want to change my character... Slightly
How's your day going so far? Did you already meet up with Alex?
07.02.23, 17:11 - Niki: Yeah we going to Leipzig later to meet up with someone for there birthday. It's quit nice to see him again talk a lot with him about future and stuff everything is settled now.
07.02.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm glad you guys talked about everything 😊 Have fun at the birthday celebration! I'm just gonna drop dead on the sofa 😴
07.02.23, 17:14 - Niki: What do you want to change about your character? Does Luna play a lot of dnd. Hope you did leave jinte out of the conversation. She mabye had her hands full with navigating ☺️
07.02.23, 17:15 - Niki: Yeah we just play some mortal combat and are getting ready to go now ☺️ have a nice rest from your 20km walk 🥰
07.02.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just a couple of minor details that might make it more powerful, I still have to adjust things to the campaign anyway! Yeah, Luna is starting a new campaign with some online friends soon and she watches a lot of videos about it so she knows a _lot_ more than I do. Definitely left Jinte out of that conversation... She did scouts so she *should* be good at navigation you would think 😅
07.02.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love, enjoy your evening 😘
07.02.23, 17:27 - Niki: Poor jinte but nice. Luna will be a good DM for sure. Thanks hope your evening will be nice too😘
08.02.23, 00:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
08.02.23, 00:42 - Niki: Driving home now and then I will go to sleep
08.02.23, 00:42 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
08.02.23, 00:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Drive safe, hope you had a good time 😊
08.02.23, 00:48 - Niki: Yeah was really nice to talk with my friends again ☺️
08.02.23, 13:13 - Niki: What are your plans for today? Still relaxing from your walk from yesterday?
08.02.23, 13:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I don't really have anything planned today so I'm gonna study some German :) 
How about you?
08.02.23, 13:22 - Niki: If you need some explanation or anything I can try to help you. I just need to fill out so forms because of Norway and for my university.
08.02.23, 13:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks! I'll let you know if I have any questions! Good luck with the forms and trying to not procrastinate on them 😉
08.02.23, 13:26 - Niki: Yeah I already do right now so will get back to it at times
08.02.23, 13:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good! Keep up the good work then ;)
08.02.23, 14:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question: when I come to Germany in April I will probably take the train as it's the easiest option. What trainstation should I pick as my destination?
08.02.23, 14:58 - Niki: Leipzig main train station or "haubt Bahnhof" would be the easiest
08.02.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, thanks!
08.02.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm calling with Aeneas and Jingwen now
08.02.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently Anthony might join later as well
08.02.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you want to join?
08.02.23, 18:18 - Niki: Yeah but give me 5 min
08.02.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing, let me know and I'll add you to the call
08.02.23, 18:23 - Niki: Okay I am ready
08.02.23, 18:26 - Niki: the call lags alot
08.02.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, that's sad :(
08.02.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But there's too much going on, I can't keep up with the french
08.02.23, 18:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you're okay with it, I totally forgot to ask you, sorry 😅
08.02.23, 18:52 - Niki: yeah no worrys
08.02.23, 18:52 - Niki: but i kinda need to work too but will be fine
08.02.23, 18:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, still, should probably confer with you first in the future though!
08.02.23, 19:41 - Niki: dachs dogs
08.02.23, 22:34 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
08.02.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
09.02.23, 01:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I kind of regret asking Aeneas to come over for the week... I love spending time with him but I also really want to spend some time with you 😅
Anyway, I don't know what you think and it's too late right now to think about it for me so I'm gonna go sleep, just had to get this off my chest. Night 😴😘
09.02.23, 07:18 - Niki: To be honest I feel the same way. I really like to spent a couple of days with him like 2 or maybe 3. But I would rather spend the rest of the time with you alone. I kinda miss just the two of us alone already 😅😘.
09.02.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm pretty sure Aeneas would be understanding enough if we told him we feel that way? 😅 But I'm glad we're on the same page 😘
09.02.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also what are you up to today?
09.02.23, 09:30 - Niki: The interview at 14:00 and else just some small stuff I push back the howl time. When is your cousin coming and what else did you plan today?
09.02.23, 09:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My cousin is coming in an hour, just enough time for me to take a nice (though lonely ;)) shower and eat some breakfast. I don't know when she's going home, but probably not too late. I have planned nothing else today and I kinda hope she leaves around 7 or something so we can have our movie date 😊
09.02.23, 09:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel like I've wished you luck with the interview like 20 times already, but still, good luck! 😁
09.02.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
09.02.23, 10:43 - Niki: yes
09.02.23, 10:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks! 😘
09.02.23, 13:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the bazzilioned time good luck! 🍀🍀🍀
09.02.23, 15:09 - Niki: Okay so I waited in the teams meeting for a hour now and nobody show up. I fucking love this interview stuff 😅
09.02.23, 15:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Excuse me what??? How did that happen?? Did you send them an email about it? That's ridiculous...
09.02.23, 15:18 - Niki: Yeah send email mit way but no response yet will see. I am kinda fine with it because of the Disney land think but will see
09.02.23, 15:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you get a response soon and an explanation 😅 but yeah, the Disneyland thing could explain some things I guess 😅
09.02.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just hope it wasn't because the interview was supposed to be at 1 or something stupid like that
09.02.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And they gave you the wrong date/hour... Fucking imagine
09.02.23, 15:21 - Niki: Yeah no idea will see
09.02.23, 15:22 - Niki: Whats going on with you and your cousin? How is the show?
09.02.23, 15:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The show is really good... Forgot how much I liked it, we're just constantly talking about it, it's a lot of fun 😊
09.02.23, 15:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So what are you gonna do now for the rest of the day?
09.02.23, 15:24 - Niki: Nice hope it doesn't Ende on a cliffhanger. Nothing much go shopping with my mom and some task I still need to do.
09.02.23, 15:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... It kinda ends on a cliffhanger but it's not a bad one, just an open ending I guess? Third season should be out next year so we're just waiting for that I guess 😅
Have fun shopping, hope it doesn't take too long ;)
09.02.23, 15:40 - Niki: Yeah we going to shopping now. What are your doing now or are your plans for the rest of the day
09.02.23, 15:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just continuing to watch the series, nothing else planned (except our date of course 😘(if it's not too late 😅))
09.02.23, 15:44 - Niki: Will see don't try to rush or too force it. We can do it any day I have nothing much planned except Saturday
09.02.23, 15:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hah, we have a similar planning then, I also have nothing planned except Saturday. I'll let you know 🥰
09.02.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're going out for dinner apparently so I think it'll be a little too late when we get back... 🥲 
Tomorrow? ❤️
09.02.23, 18:18 - Niki: Sure no worries ❤️
09.02.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love 😘
09.02.23, 20:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Speeded through dinner somehow and we're home now
09.02.23, 20:31 - Niki: Nice if u want to do it today I already start watching some documentary on the porch 911 with my parent sorry 😅
09.02.23, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Diese Nachricht wurde gelöscht.
09.02.23, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, nah, don't worry, we can do it tomorrow 😊
09.02.23, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy the documentary 😘
09.02.23, 20:32 - Niki: Okay enjoy what ever you do tonight too sorry again 😘
09.02.23, 20:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why say sorry?? Totally makes sense ❤️
09.02.23, 20:33 - Niki: Yeah I don't know ❤️
10.02.23, 00:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
10.02.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, what's on your planning today?
10.02.23, 11:42 - Niki: Good morning I took a shower and didn't see the text. Some university stuff and at 13:15 too my grandparents too watch over there dog while they go to a funeral. What about you?
10.02.23, 11:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: An hour shower? Do I want to know what you did in there?
10.02.23, 11:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I'm just kidding, don't worry ;)
10.02.23, 11:44 - Niki: I didn't look at it afterwards but yeah
10.02.23, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, yes, you told me about the dogwatching! I have literally nothing planned today, just have to go to the store and that's it :) So I'll probably try to study some more German
10.02.23, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was joking, you really don't have to explain yourself to me 😭
10.02.23, 11:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are we still on for tonight? And if so, what time?
10.02.23, 11:56 - Niki: Yeah I don't know what time tough
10.02.23, 11:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 7?
10.02.23, 11:58 - Niki: Sure
10.02.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay! Looking forward to it then! 😘
10.02.23, 11:59 - Niki: Me too 😘 BTW the i got the Dutch book now we look into over the weekend
10.02.23, 12:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, nice! Let me know if you have any questions or if you just wanna look over it together!
10.02.23, 18:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What level of knowing each other do you have to be at to call each other 'du' instead of 'Sie'? Because the book is really vague and says you 'communicate that between individuals' but that sounds awkward as fuck
10.02.23, 18:23 - Niki: It's like friends or professional if they allow it but most of the times it's family and friends.
10.02.23, 18:24 - Niki: You can call anyone 'du' but it's disrespect full for some / in general
10.02.23, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
10.02.23, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, okay, I think I get it now, thanks! 😘
10.02.23, 18:25 - Niki: So cute Moustache 😍
10.02.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Really cute, also really annoying, he's disrupting me when I'm trying to study 😂
10.02.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or well, he's 'keeping me company' 😜
10.02.23, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ready?
10.02.23, 19:00 - Niki: Yeah

11.02.23, 18:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, thank you! ❤️
11.02.23, 19:13 - Niki: Everytime 🥰
11.02.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was your day?
11.02.23, 22:47 - Niki: It was quit nice. The escape room was interesting we got the worst ending we only helped the bad guys and killed everyone except us. It was more story than escape room tbh. For dinner we cooked "Flammenkuchen" was tasty. How was you day?
11.02.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte here :))
11.02.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Heyyyy

11.02.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just took my phone back... Being a menace is in their blood 😀
11.02.23, 22:53 - Niki: What else did you do today?
11.02.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like an interesting escape room, nothing like I have done before
11.02.23, 22:53 - Niki: Was really nice we need to do one
11.02.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Went driving with my dad, went pretty well, didn't really do anything else today... Wasn't productive at all 😅
11.02.23, 22:54 - Niki: It's the weekend don't need to be
11.02.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough, also my last weekend of rest if what my teachers are saying about the bachelor thesis is true, I'll take it :)
11.02.23, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also doing a Valentine's brunch box with my parents tomorrow apparently... I feel like I'm invading a date BUT food 😁

12.02.23, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
12.02.23, 13:07 - Niki: Just procrastination at its finest how about you ?
12.02.23, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hah! I feel that! I'm doing good, nothing special 😊
12.02.23, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anything I can do to motivate you?
12.02.23, 13:09 - Niki: I don't think so but I got some motivation out of this text so yeah 😘
12.02.23, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😘
12.02.23, 15:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you get any further in what you have to do?
12.02.23, 15:03 - Niki: Yeah did get some done. Now it's tee and coffee time with my family. How is your day going. Still doing the German book?
12.02.23, 15:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good! We just ate brunch... 😂 Yeah, I'm still working on the German book. Wanna call later and compare books if you have time? Enjoy the coffee and tea, I actually just read about that in the book! 😁
12.02.23, 15:07 - Niki: 😁 Nice it's paratical knowledge. But yeah mabye around 17:00 or what time you got in mind?
12.02.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's good I think! My cousin might come over later but I don't know when. She was going to let me know when she was done with her (of course it is) German homework 😂
Anyway, I'll let you know 😘
12.02.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But so far 17 is good!
12.02.23, 15:16 - Niki: I mean you and me can help her with it 🥰
12.02.23, 15:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, yeah, that's true! I'll let her know 😂❤️
12.02.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm pretty sure her German is better than mine at this point though so if she decides to accept the offer... You're on your own 😅😜
12.02.23, 15:25 - Niki: No worrys I think I got this and if I help your cousin in anyway. I am glad to be of help😁🥰
12.02.23, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're too sweet 🥹🥰
12.02.23, 17:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Give me a couple of minutes
12.02.23, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ready to call?
12.02.23, 17:20 - Niki: Sorry still need some time
12.02.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, okay, let me know, don't rush 😘
12.02.23, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or just call me when you can 😊
12.02.23, 17:27 - Niki: I am ready
12.02.23, 17:28 - Niki: Sorry forgot the time and my dad ask me to get him from somewhere
12.02.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The first thing my cousin asked me when she got here? If we had sex... This teenager.... 🙄
12.02.23, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I did about an hour of counselling I guess? And then 20 minutes of trying to convince her not to get involved with a guy she told me about that had like 20 red flags popping up... Hope I helped a little though. Also, you and I have been invited for dinner at my aunt's place (Laura's mom) in the time you're here, I don't know if you'd be up for that or not?
12.02.23, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What did you end up making?
12.02.23, 21:40 - Niki: We ate "brattkartofell" was really nice for with some eggs and tomatoes in there
12.02.23, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice!
12.02.23, 21:42 - Niki: About the dinner invitation sure sounds fun. The hour was well spent on helping your cousin. Hope she does go against it with the guy but you know everybody makes mistakes at some point in there life
12.02.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I'll ask her when would fit best then :)
Yeahhh, the first thing she told me was that he is a player and the second that he slept with his friend's sister... Then again, I also told her that if she feels comfortable with it or if she really wants to make that mistake that she can, she's young but I also know she's not stupid so it's her own responsibility, just as it is mine to warn her against it. Anyway, I feel like it was alright :)
12.02.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
13.02.23, 13:34 - Niki: How is your day going? Are at your university for the meeting? How else is in your group?
13.02.23, 13:34 - Niki: I fell a sleep again yesterday sorry
13.02.23, 13:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm at school... It's fucking bullshit honestly, things I learned in high school... But mandatory
13.02.23, 13:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
13.02.23, 13:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also we weren't allowed on our phones or laptops until now... I feel like I'm back in high school, it's weird as hell
13.02.23, 13:40 - Niki: It's going okish. Working on my papers for university but I have no motivation/jumping on every Opportunity for procrastination. 😅
13.02.23, 13:41 - Niki: Yeah sounds like they treat you like children. Really nice of them 🙃
13.02.23, 13:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They do, she's constantly walking around too
13.02.23, 13:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh... I wish I could help!
13.02.23, 13:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She even threatened to seat two people apart because they were talking too much... We're in our last year bachelor... Bullshit
13.02.23, 13:47 - Niki: No worrys I got this. You can get through it without bashing her head in
 (I kown you are a pasifist but some people)
13.02.23, 13:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If she takes my laptop or phone I'm suing her, easy :)
13.02.23, 13:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, you got this! Kick your to-do-list's arse! ;p
13.02.23, 15:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I swear to god that was the biggest waste of time  of my life...
13.02.23, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going with you?
13.02.23, 15:01 - Niki: Wasting time too and procrastinating but got something done.
13.02.23, 15:02 - Niki: What are your plans for now for this afternoon
13.02.23, 15:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, you'll get there eventually
13.02.23, 15:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just dance class tonight I think
13.02.23, 15:21 - Niki: Would love to see you dance 🥰
13.02.23, 15:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... I don't know, I'm really not that good 😅... But maybe in 2 weeks depending on the room it is in, idk
13.02.23, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out you would be able to see me dance, the room is the one with big windows 😅
Also, my dad installed the fan in my computer and fixed it... Didn't need a new one at all!!
13.02.23, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got anything else done?
13.02.23, 19:01 - Niki: Not really went to Alex and talk a bit about stupid stuff was quit funny
13.02.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds fun, better than staying at home for sure 😊
13.02.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
13.02.23, 22:13 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
14.02.23, 00:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you
14.02.23, 07:19 - Niki: I miss you too
14.02.23, 10:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today?
14.02.23, 10:45 - Niki: Paper and meet up with Alex. What about you any plans for today?
14.02.23, 10:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, just school until 7
14.02.23, 10:58 - Niki: Sucks still the same thing as yesterday where they watch over you?
14.02.23, 10:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp... If none of my friends are going today I'm just sitting all the way in the back or something...
14.02.23, 10:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun with Alex!
14.02.23, 11:00 - Niki: Thx  yeah hope they come what exactly do the talk about or what are you working on there?
14.02.23, 11:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just methodology of a research paper... Shit I've seen thousands of times by now, but yeah, can't do anything about it so... I'll suffer through it 😭
14.02.23, 11:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I had to take a 2 hour nap after I came home yesterday because I was so _done_ with it
14.02.23, 11:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How the paper going though?
14.02.23, 11:03 - Niki: Yeah get that. Mabye today there will be something atleast a little bit interesting
14.02.23, 11:03 - Niki: Nearly done need to reread and change some sentence building
14.02.23, 11:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's great! I'm happy that's almost done!
14.02.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you want to know some drama in my friendgroup?
14.02.23, 21:55 - Niki: Do I know these people but sure
14.02.23, 21:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte and Lars...
14.02.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently you were right... There is a vibe and now I'm dealing with a very confused Jinte
14.02.23, 21:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So basically Lars said he might be interested but he knows she doesn't want a relationship right now. Which is true, but she also kinda likes him (has since high school) so she doesn't want a relationship right now but doesn't want to exclude the possibility for the future... So they're staying friends? For now?
14.02.23, 22:03 - Niki: Will answer later we on the road right now
14.02.23, 23:05 - Niki: Driving home now will write you then
14.02.23, 23:50 - Niki: First of all I was never so supprised to be right about a think in my life. Okay what are your Tipps for jinte in this situation? I thought mabye she should try it but I am not there and I didn't talk with jinte so I don't know how she thinks about it. But if she doesn't want to she should tell him. It's hard. Why could he wait a little bit longer 🙄.
14.02.23, 23:50 - Niki: Sorry to let you wait for so long 😅
14.02.23, 23:50 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
14.02.23, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just told her not to lead him on if she doesn't feel like it's gonna turn into anything anytime soon. She said she doesn't know, but he's also kind of involved with that couple so... God, it's just too confusing and I'm not sure, they could either be a great couple or they could find out they aren't compatible like that at all in the first 3 weeks... At this point they both suck at deciding so nothing is changing so far but yeah... He should have waited a little longer with this one 😅
14.02.23, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's okay, did you have a nice night? I'd much rather you have me wait than being unsafe
14.02.23, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And before the day is entirely over... Happy Valentine's ❤️
14.02.23, 23:59 - Niki: Yeah my night was great just tried now. At 7 some of our friends came over and we played some card games and drove to eat something.
14.02.23, 23:59 - Niki: Happy valentine's day my love 😘❤️
15.02.23, 00:00 - Niki: Oh right the couple think I totally forgot about that. Well she should listen to her heart I guess. If she is unsure they should meet up
15.02.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, honestly as long as they're civil and nothing is for certain it's none of my business unless someone asks me about it. I just hope they'll both be alright
15.02.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, I think I'm going to sleep
15.02.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
15.02.23, 00:02 - Niki: Same would hate to see along friendships break because of some thing like this
15.02.23, 00:02 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
15.02.23, 00:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly
15.02.23, 13:00 - Niki: How is your day going? BTW is it okay to write you while you are in class or should I wait till your done. It kinda kept me from writing you sooner today 😅.
15.02.23, 13:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hey! My day is going quite good, busy though. I also can't go to Lille but Aeneas said it's fine, still wish I could be there though. How's your day going?
You can always text me, no worries 😊 my phone is usually on silent but I like to check it often. And I always love seeing a message from you 😘
15.02.23, 13:08 - Niki: Nice yeah Aeneas also send me the apparments  and told me he would go today. They look pretty nice. Yeah my day is going great kinda produktiv today feels good. Do a lot of work on my papers need to send them in on Friday but Friday is also dnd. So I need to finish it earlier like tomorrow probably.
15.02.23, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When I texted him today though, he said his first meeting the guy didn't show up... I hope the others are better... But yeah, they looked pretty nice on the website! 
I'm happy you're feeling good and productive today, probably best to have it done by tomorrow yeah, so courage with that ❤️
15.02.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yo, you wanna join a call with Aeneas? He's stuck in Lille for another 2 hours 😅
15.02.23, 17:46 - Niki: Sorry I can't i with my family right now 🥲
15.02.23, 17:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, have fun! 😘
15.02.23, 17:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aeneas says hi nonetheless 😊
15.02.23, 17:46 - Niki: Did he get one of the apartments or what did they tell him?
15.02.23, 17:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's a whole story behind it, I'll tell you later?
15.02.23, 17:48 - Niki: Okay sounds interesting
15.02.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So basically he only visited 1/3 apartments today because the first one didn't show up and the second one the guy didn't have the keys for... So he's going back on Monday to visit those last 2
15.02.23, 18:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But he'll probably tell you all about it when you guys talk :)
15.02.23, 18:46 - Niki: That sounds really weird. Hope he doesn't need to go again for a third time.
15.02.23, 18:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, me too...
15.02.23, 18:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He also had a pretty good idea though. I talked to him about us wanting some private time and he said that because both of us need to work in the week anyway, he could stay a few days like Sunday, Monday Tuesday and then maybe come back in the weekend after that? That way we have some time to ourselves and he isn't bored all day doing nothing
15.02.23, 18:52 - Niki: Sounds good
15.02.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day been?
15.02.23, 21:41 - Niki: It's been quit nice. But after 15:00 I didn't do anything productive anymore kinda sucks. But I gone to my sisters house and we cooked together "Flammenkuche". How was your day
15.02.23, 21:41 - Niki: *?
15.02.23, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least you were productive before 15! And family time is always important! Had a pretty good day, just still have a couple of things I should technically do today, but I can still do them tomorrow just fine... Procrastination at it's best 😅😁
15.02.23, 21:45 - Niki: What do you still need to do. Did you get your workplace tour today. You start Thursday right with your intership?
15.02.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still need to prepare for DnD and some preparation for a meeting I have tomorrow... 30 minutes max I think, nothing to worry about. Yeah, we don't have a workplace tour before we start, just have to show up next Tuesday and then we'll have an introduction day apparently.
15.02.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I was wondering, how does your job work? Do you just get assignments you can do in your own time or do you have specific work hours?
15.02.23, 21:49 - Niki: Yeah I also need to prepare for dnd. My work i start with my studies again so the 20 next month and I can chose my own time except for meetings.
15.02.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hold up hold up, sorry, I don't understand that sentence 😭
Do you mean you start working the 20th next month or you are working until the 20th next month or what? But it's really nice you can decide when to work
15.02.23, 21:52 - Niki: I start working on 20th of next month if everything goes well
15.02.23, 21:52 - Niki: But I think so
15.02.23, 21:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhhh, okay, that makes sense!
15.02.23, 21:53 - Niki: Sorry the sentence was a build weird 😅
15.02.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, it's okay, at least there's no 20 abbreviations like my cousin uses... I need a fucking teenage thesaurus to read those sometimes 😭😅... I feel so old at those times 😂
15.02.23, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are you home now or still at your sister's?
15.02.23, 21:58 - Niki: I am home now. Thank God I love her but sometimes she is just too much talk and you can't stop her 🥲
15.02.23, 21:58 - Niki: How was your day btw?
15.02.23, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You asked that 5 minutes ago? 😂
15.02.23, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhhh, yeah, fair 😂
15.02.23, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You okay? Not too tired? 😘
15.02.23, 22:04 - Niki: Yeah probably I can't think straight anymore😅.
15.02.23, 22:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Busy day tomorrow or not?
15.02.23, 22:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Otherwise sleep 😁
15.02.23, 22:06 - Niki: Yeah busy but it's okay weekend I got free. Tomorrow still date night?
15.02.23, 22:06 - Niki: Will sleep so thought
15.02.23, 22:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Shit, I forgot to tell you, I can't tomorrow 😭
My aunt booked a restaurant a month ago so yeah... I'm sorry 😭
15.02.23, 22:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I should just share my calendar with you goddamn
15.02.23, 22:08 - Niki: Okay yeah now worrys.
15.02.23, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can you do sometime this weekend?
15.02.23, 22:08 - Niki: Yeah sure need to see which day but yeah
15.02.23, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For God's sake, I can't do next Thursday either... Fucking bullshit...
15.02.23, 22:09 - Niki: It's okay we can reschedule
15.02.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me know, I'm free the whole weekend so whenever works best for you
15.02.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you, you're the best ❤️
15.02.23, 22:10 - Niki: I am going to sleep now
15.02.23, 22:10 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
15.02.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️

18.02.23, 23:05 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
19.02.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How are you doing? Sleep well?
19.02.23, 12:01 - Niki: I don't know why but in the last 3 or 4 days I wake up before 8. Yeah doing great working on the web project and entertaining my nephew. How about you? What are your plans and how did you sleep?
19.02.23, 12:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's so early 😭 I could never. Didn't sleep great, but it's fine. How are you both entertaining a kid and working on the project at the same time?? That's impressive!
19.02.23, 12:09 - Niki: Yeah he just build some stuff with big Lego and shows it to me or he play fireman with his toys.
19.02.23, 12:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's cute 😊
19.02.23, 12:50 - Niki: I got it wrong my dad ate the chocolate but didn't like. He still finish it though
19.02.23, 13:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh god... That's persistence though, damn 😂
19.02.23, 18:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How'd your day go so far? Any progress on the project?
19.02.23, 18:57 - Niki: yeah working slowly on it but progress. How about you what did you do? how is your day going?
19.02.23, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Progress is progress! 
Day went pretty well, went walking with 2 dogs, they're adorable, I think I have some pictures!
19.02.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
19.02.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
19.02.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The corgi is called Freya and she's stubborn as hell. The other one is called Jefke, he sounds like he has asthma but he's _fast_
19.02.23, 19:02 - Niki: 😆 Sounds really nice. Btw first time i see a picture of your cousin. Corgi are allways stuborn i think
19.02.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah! That's true! So that's Cato, you can see how tall they are?? Yeah, my mom loved the corgi for sure, but she just planted herself into the ground sometimes and refused to move 😅
19.02.23, 19:05 - Niki: To be Honest i dont know what to do if a dog or a kid just lays on the ground and refuses to move.
19.02.23, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh... Me neither... Apparently you're supposed to pull them along to show 'who's boss' but I just don't want to hurt the dog...
19.02.23, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also have fun with this conversation I just had with Jinte... Why the fuck are we even friends??
19.02.23, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

19.02.23, 19:12 - Niki: As far as your aware 😉
19.02.23, 19:14 - Niki: We need to buy a duo costume
19.02.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have something to tell me? 😂
19.02.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh dear lord... That is an awful idea but so good at the same time... 😁
19.02.23, 19:14 - Niki: No 😞
19.02.23, 19:15 - Niki: I would love to see her try to "rizz" you up while you are in a duo costume
19.02.23, 19:16 - Niki: Would laugh till I get no oxygen anymore
19.02.23, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: God... I... The image alone is enough to kill me inside 😂
19.02.23, 19:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That would be the funniest thing that would ever happen in my entire life
19.02.23, 19:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing could top that
19.02.23, 19:18 - Niki: Just the image alone 😂
19.02.23, 21:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am actually so nervous for this next week, I don't know if I will be able to sleep tonight 😅 any tips?
19.02.23, 21:44 - Niki: It's gone be alright tomorrow you just have class.
19.02.23, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, not really? We have to present what our plan is going forward and our client has to agree to that... If she doesn't we are kinda screwed 😅
19.02.23, 21:47 - Niki: It's gone be alright. Your are a group and she can't fail you all
19.02.23, 21:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She most definitely can but anyway, I'll skip over that. Honestly you can tell me anything at this point and I don't think it will help much, but thanks for trying 😘 (it's my own mistake for asking you when in all honesty no matter what you said I'll probably still lay awake thinking of shit 😅) sorry about that 😅
19.02.23, 21:50 - Niki: Just watch something really boring
19.02.23, 21:50 - Niki: Twilight mabye
19.02.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, maybe, but I think twilight is more likely to drive me mad than get me to sleep 😂
19.02.23, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, let me know how much you have to pay for fuel to get here please. I think it's only fair I pay part of the price if you drive all the way over here
19.02.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
19.02.23, 22:52 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
20.02.23, 09:40 - Niki: Good luck with your presentation today hope she accepts everything
20.02.23, 10:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love 🥰 Just had the presentation and it went quite alright I guess? How's your day looking?
20.02.23, 10:02 - Niki: Look great nothing planed no worrys just working on the project again. What are your plans for the rest of the day?
20.02.23, 10:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with the project! Working on the BAP until 17, then dance tonight. When are you planning on watching the All Star game?
20.02.23, 10:07 - Niki: Yeah was too tired yesterday so probably gone watch it later today
20.02.23, 10:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably same
20.02.23, 12:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going for lunch now, how's the project coming along?
20.02.23, 13:07 - Niki: I didn't work on it instead I start to clean out my room in my parents house
20.02.23, 13:08 - Niki: With you BAP group
20.02.23, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, are you starting to move then? Or just a clean up? Nah, just went for lunch with Matt, now back to work!
20.02.23, 13:14 - Niki: Yeah my mom told me to clean up and I move after the 15
20.02.23, 13:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, okay! A lot to do or not?
20.02.23, 13:28 - Niki: Not really
20.02.23, 15:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yo, I just realized we're together for 2 months now?? Damn, it feels like much longer somehow
20.02.23, 16:01 - Niki: Yeah feel the same way. But tbh I don't know the exact day. The Norway days were so fast 😅
20.02.23, 16:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Someone just asked me about our relationship and I said 2 months but realized I also didn't know the exact day so I went back in my conversation with Alex. The 20th apparently!
20.02.23, 16:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also love how invested my teammate is in our relationship, he was also so shocked you stay at my place when you visit after 'only 2 months' 😂
20.02.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have anything to do? If not wanna call? Idk, just feel like hearing your voice or seeing your face or something 😅
20.02.23, 16:58 - Niki: I am out right now with Alex but in a hour we can call
20.02.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me know when you get home, not sure if it'll fit since I have to leave for dance in an hour and a half (should be home by 8:30 though idk). But don't rush, have fun with Alex! 😘 If not today another day 😊
20.02.23, 17:35 - Niki: Yeah I think we need to call tomorrow Alex wants to hang out some more sorry. But I got time tomorrow 😘
20.02.23, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah of course! Tomorrow works for me 😊 Give Alex my regards or something and have fun ❤️

21.02.23, 09:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today?
21.02.23, 09:15 - Niki: Working on the web project nothing much.
21.02.23, 10:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with that! 😘
21.02.23, 12:17 - Niki: Oh BTW I watch the menu last night. Its pretty good especially the ending I don't know why but I but it felt really nice. How is your first day going?
21.02.23, 12:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's going pretty well so far! Everyone is out now to get lunch but I brought my own so I'm just waiting for them. They gave us a book and a water bottle and an introduction to the company, we only start actually working tomorrow. I'm glad you liked the movie! I liked the ending a lot too. How's the project going?
21.02.23, 12:22 - Niki: Yeah it's going alright. Wait so you get off work early today? Or are they still introducing you to the others in the company
21.02.23, 12:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're still going to do some more introductions, but I'm pretty sure we're not staying until 5 today, who knows though?
21.02.23, 18:36 - Niki: How was the rest of the day? Do you know what your first task gone be?
21.02.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can I call you when I get home? In +-15 minutes?
21.02.23, 19:04 - Niki: Yeah sure
21.02.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️

22.02.23, 09:24 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
22.02.23, 10:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, yeah it is 😂
22.02.23, 10:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Work is really boring right now... They're just having us make incisions in a stack of folders 😅
22.02.23, 10:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
22.02.23, 10:11 - Niki: Wow Damm that's yeah boring. Well unpaid intern work.
22.02.23, 10:11 - Niki: Hope it's not that many folders
22.02.23, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
22.02.23, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So... Yeah, a lot
22.02.23, 10:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And don't rub it in my face that it's unpaid please 😭
22.02.23, 10:12 - Niki: Sorry but yeah guess you can talk with the others atl least
22.02.23, 10:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not right now, Gerardo had to go to the store for another knife, but he'll be back in a couple of minutes
22.02.23, 10:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So yeah, at least we can talk then!
22.02.23, 10:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, they also took us to the store to buy decorative rocks?? Random as fuck
22.02.23, 10:16 - Niki: Okay you got some nice ones at least xD
22.02.23, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And now we're doing interior design
22.02.23, 11:06 - Niki: Wait what explain. What and why
22.02.23, 11:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They want plant pots
22.02.23, 11:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For their fake plants
22.02.23, 11:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So we're supposed to give them a proposal I guess?
22.02.23, 11:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And after that we're gonna see how to place them around the office, so yeah... interior design
22.02.23, 11:12 - Niki: xD the work you need to do is special. I would have never predicted that 😅
22.02.23, 11:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... Me neither. Kinda funny though, not gonna lie
22.02.23, 11:20 - Niki: Nice i mean it's probably better than make incisions into folders 😅
22.02.23, 11:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, we still have to do that though, that's for when we 'don't have any more work'
22.02.23, 11:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But apparently they always make the interns do the incisions
22.02.23, 13:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you have a good example of German schlager? I need to show it to Gerardo who has no clue what it is
22.02.23, 13:33 - Niki: Skandal im Sperrbezirk
22.02.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks! 😘
22.02.23, 22:30 - Niki: Yeah it really nice to see ole again. He has some problems with his cats but nothing major. Talk a lot and went playing some billiard and eat ramen for dinner after that. How was your day? How did the your first day of "real work"(not in a negative sense) go?
22.02.23, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Problems with his cats? In what way? Sounds like you had a good time 😊
My day was pretty good honestly, the other junior employees told us they all had the same kind of work when they just got there. Also just nice getting to know Gerardo a bit better, we get along much better than I thought we were going to! And they eventually showed us what we will actually be working on in the coming days, looks pretty interesting.
22.02.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just now looking at the All Star game with my dad
22.02.23, 22:36 - Niki: The dunks are nice this year
22.02.23, 22:37 - Niki: His cat got some sickness. But she is getting better.
22.02.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, true!
22.02.23, 22:38 - Niki: Your day sounds nice hope the rest of the week will be good too.
22.02.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahh... That's the worst! I hope she gets better soon
22.02.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so too for you 🥰
What's on your plan for tomorrow?
22.02.23, 22:40 - Niki: Nothing much just some relaxing did enough stuff with friends.
22.02.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds good, Aeneas told me he wants to call you tomorrow. Also Jingwen is in Italy now apparently??
22.02.23, 22:43 - Niki: Crazy how come but nice for him. Okay thx for. The heads up will make some time.
22.02.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently his mom decided on a random vacation 2 weeks ago so... There he is? You'll probably hear about it from Aeneas
22.02.23, 22:45 - Niki: Nice sounds interesting
22.02.23, 22:46 - Niki: I going to sleep now
22.02.23, 22:46 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
22.02.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm also going to sleep once this is done

23.02.23, 09:58 - Niki: Thx woke up now. How is your day going and did you get new task for today?
23.02.23, 10:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We got an introduction to some software they use and then were told to check it out, so that's what I'm doing now. So far so good?
23.02.23, 10:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
23.02.23, 11:22 - Niki: Got some problems with my project so i try to fix 😅 but else everything is good
23.02.23, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you figure it out! 🍀
23.02.23, 13:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One thing that is good about not having too much to do is that I'm already getting started on my internship report
23.02.23, 13:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the project going? You figure it out?
23.02.23, 13:19 - Niki: No really still trying around
23.02.23, 13:19 - Niki: Sounds nice how much do u need to do for the report
23.02.23, 13:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you can fix it soon
23.02.23, 13:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honestly not that much, just a reflection, introduction of the company, those kinds of things
23.02.23, 13:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But hey, at least I now have the template ready!
23.02.23, 13:23 - Niki: But if you have it done then you don't need to worry about it anymore. And more free time later 🥰

23.02.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, we're gonna go for tacos! Not gonna be too late I hope though
23.02.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question... What is a date according to you? Like, what factors need to be included in a date?
23.02.23, 17:57 - Niki: I don't know. But something with just two(how many are in the relationship) people doing something  "special" together I guess or something that they
23.02.23, 17:57 - Niki: *like
23.02.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay let me put this differently because I see I asked that in a way too hypothetical way. What would you like to do on a date? Or if you don't know that, what would you not like to do on a date?
23.02.23, 18:00 - Niki: I don't care to be honest as long as I can do it with you. Sorry but it's true 😅🥰
23.02.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... that is both very cute and very annoying at the same time... 😘
23.02.23, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But how am I supposed to plan things like this?? Well, not even plan, just look for ideas 😅
23.02.23, 18:02 - Niki: Sorry but just let do something you like I will love it too 🥰
23.02.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... stop
23.02.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Stop being so cute
23.02.23, 20:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.02.23, 20:10 - Niki: Damm looks good. Hope you have great time catching up 🥰
23.02.23, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's really fun 😊 what are you doing?
23.02.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (also turns out it's been almost 5 years since we last saw each other properly 😅)
23.02.23, 20:11 - Niki: Nothing much just looking for something to watch
23.02.23, 20:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... Good luck with that! And have fun 😘
23.02.23, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question
23.02.23, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I'm sorry in advance for this
23.02.23, 20:40 - Niki: ¿
23.02.23, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But my friend Margot wants to go on a dubble date next Wednesday... If you would be okay with that/be here then?
23.02.23, 20:41 - Niki: Sure why not.
23.02.23, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dude... You're too easy going I swear
23.02.23, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you don't want to you don't have to 😅
23.02.23, 20:42 - Niki: No sounds fun i am excited to be honest 😅
23.02.23, 20:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okayyyy, that's great 😁😘
23.02.23, 20:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did not expect that but I'm glad you don't mind 😊
23.02.23, 20:44 - Niki: With the first 2 messages you got me really confused 😅
23.02.23, 20:44 - Niki: You don't need to be sorry for asking me anything
23.02.23, 20:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, sorry about that 😅
23.02.23, 21:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We almost were planning to go to the erotica convention... I swear to god this is the second time I had this conversation with someone. First time was with Alex I think...
23.02.23, 21:52 - Niki: How is that the second time you talk with somebody about this  conversation and how do you get to this topics with people. I mean Alex I get but still. But sure I will have a red face though
23.02.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... I have no clue honestly, I am not even the one starting the conversation! Margot had the idea... You would have a red face during the conversation or at the convention? 😉
23.02.23, 21:55 - Niki: At the Convention
23.02.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... Probably same for the first 5 minutes but after that I think you get used to it
23.02.23, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's with the shocked face? 🙃
23.02.23, 22:05 - Niki: Well just surprised about the stone face in public again. But we will see 😉😘
23.02.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I told you, I choose when to let my guard down 😘
23.02.23, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I invite you to a lovedown date in Ghent. https://visit.gent.be/en/lovedown/invitee/c7871e45-d487-4372-9a1c-1e0683b64e93
23.02.23, 22:35 - Niki: Okay to be honest I cheat the quiz but I like the second date ideas better than the first 3
23.02.23, 22:35 - Niki: So I am fine with them 😁
23.02.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay but what are the ideas? Because I didn't get them 😂
23.02.23, 22:36 - Niki: https://visit.gent.be/en/lovedown/invitee/c7871e45-d487-4372-9a1c-1e0683b64e93/suggestions
23.02.23, 22:37 - Niki: Can you see them with the link?
23.02.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Missy sippy?
23.02.23, 22:37 - Niki: Sure
23.02.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, is that the one you were talking about?
23.02.23, 22:38 - Niki: No all 3 of them are better than the first 3 I got
23.02.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhhh, I see now!
23.02.23, 22:39 - Niki: Wait they change I every time i do the quiz again
23.02.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So you like the walk by the water, Missy sippy and NH Hotel then?
23.02.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahah, okay
23.02.23, 22:40 - Niki: But yeah better than an B&B, I walk in the park where we were before because we already were there and something I can't remember
23.02.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh... Yeah fair
23.02.23, 22:42 - Niki: https://visit.gent.be/en/eat-drink/charlatan
23.02.23, 22:43 - Niki: I also got this sounds interesting what exactly is that though?
23.02.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is... The most infamous cafe in Ghent. I think we even have a movie about it? Never been there before but it's like a dancing/club kind of? Know several people that were kicked out though 😂
23.02.23, 22:45 - Niki: Ah okay I not a club person but I don't mind going to one with you 🥰
23.02.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not really a club person either though 😅 
But if you want to go I'm always up to it ❤️
23.02.23, 22:48 - Niki: Yeah na mabye another time
23.02.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure that works
23.02.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
23.02.23, 23:26 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
24.02.23, 08:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today? Other than the party tonight
24.02.23, 08:52 - Niki: Need to some chores for my parents. After that probably just working on the project until the party starts. How about you? How is you self presenting slide looking?
24.02.23, 09:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, did you figure out the problem you had yesterday? For me it's just more working on the analysis and then the presentation this afternoon. I feel like my slide is very much sad when I compare it to Gerardos though... He really put some effort in 😅
24.02.23, 09:06 - Niki: Yeah no i didn't si back to it today 🥲
24.02.23, 09:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you get it today then!
24.02.23, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have you ever seen/heard of raspberry chipotle tabasco?
24.02.23, 15:02 - Niki: No never i know what each for it self is but together never heard/seen it. But sounds like a interesting combination.
24.02.23, 15:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Huh... It's only sold in Germany, Austria and Mexico for some reason
24.02.23, 15:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have to do research on it
24.02.23, 15:08 - Niki: Mabye I will find it today will go shopping later
24.02.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, would be funny if you did
24.02.23, 15:10 - Niki: What do you research for it exactly. Like numbers of sold Tabasco or flavor combinations with it?
24.02.23, 15:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We want to propose a new flavour to them, so we need to know what they have so far and how people actually think about it... So yeah
24.02.23, 15:12 - Niki: Okay I don't know how long you have but if I see it I will buy it
24.02.23, 15:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, you don't have to buy it, it's all good. Also really bad nutritionally 😅
24.02.23, 15:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have until sometime next week I guess? They're coming on Monday but it's not like the info you will give me is anything I can figure out from here anyway, so no worries
24.02.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But if you could take a picture (if you can even find it) I would be immensely grateful 😊
24.02.23, 15:22 - Niki: Okay I have a mission now
24.02.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
24.02.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Everyone was very impressed by my 546 day streak 😂
24.02.23, 19:24 - Niki: It is impressive to be honest. Did you talk about dnd or was it too Nerdy
24.02.23, 19:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't talk about, didn't want to stretch the presentation too long
24.02.23, 21:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
Enjoy the party 😘
24.02.23, 21:50 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
24.02.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dear god I just want to go to sleep why do teenagers have so much energy?? (Context my cousin is staying over and wants to stay up late... I regret this) anyway, enjoy the party, sorry, had to complain to someone 😅❤️
24.02.23, 22:42 - Niki: No worrys we also only go out because some one wanted to play billiard now
24.02.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Billiard is fun, hope you win 😁
24.02.23, 22:43 - Niki: Hope you have a good time. Text any time you want to
24.02.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (at least you have a chance now you're not on a team with a total newbie like me 😜)
24.02.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope I have a good time in my dreams yeah 😂 but thanks, same to you 😘
24.02.23, 22:46 - Niki: You are better than most of my friends 😁
24.02.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... you do not know how much you just boosted my ego 😂
24.02.23, 22:47 - Niki: It's true
24.02.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hardly believable but sure, I trust you 😘
24.02.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eureka she's allowing me to go to sleep! Have fun, be safe, love you and goodnight 😴😘
24.02.23, 23:08 - Niki: Goodnight hope she doesn't wake you up in the middle of the night
24.02.23, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't jinx it 😭
25.02.23, 00:45 - Niki: Meet some old classmates and it was quit nice didn't talk much but they were really nice and want to meet up sometime
25.02.23, 09:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice! Glad you had a good time 😊
25.02.23, 10:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today?
25.02.23, 11:33 - Niki: Projekt and mabye meet up wit Alex and Fabian and dnd tonight hopefully 🙏🏼. What about you?
25.02.23, 11:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, DnD was cancelled 😅 Aeneas is gonna be home too late... Good luck with the project and have fun with Alex & Fabian if you meet up. I'm going shopping with my cousin 😅...
25.02.23, 11:40 - Niki: That we don't have dnd sucks to be honest but okay. Shopping with your cousin sounds sounds like a task but I guess have fun shopping 😅
25.02.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It does suck, but yeah, what can be done about it? Yeahhh... A bit of a task, but we're going for sushi for lunch so I get a reward 😁
25.02.23, 11:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But... I was thinking... If DnD is cancelled... Date night?
25.02.23, 11:44 - Niki: Yeah great idea ❤️
25.02.23, 11:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeeey, something nice tonight after all 😁

25.02.23, 22:44 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
25.02.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
25.02.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you
25.02.23, 22:45 - Niki: Love you too
26.02.23, 09:29 - Niki: You sleep well last night? Got any idea what your gone do today ?
26.02.23, 10:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Only fell asleep around 3 😅... But slept fine other than that. How about you? I think just relaxing, maybe cleaning my room. You?
26.02.23, 10:28 - Niki: Relaxing and reading mabye working on the project if I feel like it. Hope you can relax in peace. Mabye sleep a bit 😊
26.02.23, 10:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No meeting up with your friends? I know you were talking about that yesterday. Good luck with the project if you decide on it! Yeahhh... I don't think I'll sleep much more today but who knows?
26.02.23, 10:30 - Niki: Yeah I wanted to meet up with Marco mabye but I don't know mabye will see 😅
26.02.23, 10:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
26.02.23, 10:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would say something more but I literally just woke up and can't properly think right now 😅
26.02.23, 10:34 - Niki: No worrys I thought so 🥰
26.02.23, 10:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know, I just realised I dreamt you were gonna be here today... The fuck why does my brain fuck me over like this?
26.02.23, 10:43 - Niki: I wish I would be there but I got a similar dream 🥰
26.02.23, 10:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Really? Well that's interesting 😂😅 maybe slightly creepy too
26.02.23, 10:45 - Niki: Yeah well we talked yesterday for a while before going to bed so I guess is just us having the same thought going through our brain 😅
26.02.23, 10:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's true, it does make sense psychologically. Still, kinda cool/creepy 😁
26.02.23, 12:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you ever actually get an email back from the company that stood you up at the interview? Just saw a McDonalds ad and had to think of it 😅
26.02.23, 12:27 - Niki: Yeah but I talk with them after words and got a bad vibe from the team each so I declined the offer. I still have two open will see.
26.02.23, 12:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's fair. Did they give a reasonable explanation for why they didn't show up? Because that's kinda shitty honestly xx
26.02.23, 12:29 - Niki: Yeah interconflict or something so yeah just a bad vibe overall
26.02.23, 12:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a good choice to look for something else
26.02.23, 15:56 - Niki: Gone try to call Aeneas tonight or in the evening. He has shit internet there but mabye it will work 🙏🏼
26.02.23, 16:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope it works! 🤞🏻if you need my input just call me (idk what for, but just in case)
26.02.23, 16:03 - Niki: Okay, sure will see if his connection is stable
26.02.23, 18:02 - Niki: Okay so I called Aeneas we talk for 10 mins and then the internet broke off. He called me again and we are finish now. We talk about the ski trip, and he left his place in Paris and stuff he did the last week. He wants to call us on Thursday.
26.02.23, 18:03 - Niki: Also we thought about moving the dnd session to Sunday
26.02.23, 18:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thursday is good to call him! Is he having a good time skiing? DnD session could be Sunday, but I also was thinking of inviting Jinte over (because Aeneas wanted to meet her) for dinner, might make it lunch instead then idk
26.02.23, 18:14 - Niki: Yeah dnd on Sunday is kinda on the edge because Aeneas thinks has something planned. Yeah first time skiing is going good he still falling but less and less. He is improving fast. Would love to see jinte and Aeneas interact with one another 😁
26.02.23, 18:15 - Niki: *jingwen
26.02.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can ask and then see if Sunday works or not? Seeing them interact will be interesting for sure
26.02.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good that he's improving so well! Only thing that sucks is that that means I'll be the only one unable to ski next year 😅
26.02.23, 18:18 - Niki: Said the same thing and we were excited to see you try and for the howl trip on it self 😁
26.02.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... you arseholes
26.02.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will secretly learn to ski by next year 😁
26.02.23, 18:20 - Niki: 😅 Sorry but I can help you with that. I would love to go skiing with you 🥰❤️
26.02.23, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love that you feel that way but I'm sure you'll think differently once we're actually there... I'm clumsy on flat ground, nevermind on snow and skis 😅
26.02.23, 18:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would love to do anything with you though 😘❤️
26.02.23, 18:26 - Niki: That's not enough to change my mind. It's mostly you I would be there for don't care how clumsy you are 🥰
26.02.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're sweet 😘
26.02.23, 22:37 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
26.02.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
27.02.23, 08:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today?
27.02.23, 08:59 - Niki: Going shopping with my mom soon. Then at 14 I need to go to my grandparents house to do IT support. And tonight I am going to watch some trash movies with Marco
27.02.23, 09:01 - Niki: What are you plans for today? Are you all ready on your university?
27.02.23, 09:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds fun, let me know if you find the raspberry chipotle ;) Trash movies are always nice, enjoy :)
27.02.23, 09:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm at uni right now, later tonight I'll go dancing again, I think that's it for me today
27.02.23, 09:11 - Niki: Is everyone's there from your group and how did there first week go. Is there intership as interesting as yours?
27.02.23, 09:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, Matt and Vibe are sick so there's only 4 of us. The internships are... Very interesting! 1 perosn didn't go because they were sick last week, the other hates her mentor and then the last one kinda likes his so that's nice
27.02.23, 09:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thibault is also strangely interested in you, 1 of the first things he asked was if you were here already or not. I think he really wants to know how he doesn't know you from Norway 😂
27.02.23, 09:19 - Niki: Sadly I am not there right now but mabye next Monday. If he wants to see me. We'll seems like your pretty luck with your intership or you just got a good eye for people 😘
27.02.23, 09:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, next Monday we can grab lunch together 😘 (hopefully without Thibault) I guess I am really lucky so far indeed!
27.02.23, 09:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Discussing who to kill to make sure we pass the year now... Lovely conversations I swear
27.02.23, 10:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Everyone is so fucking done with this project goddamn...
27.02.23, 10:25 - Niki: All ready Damm
27.02.23, 10:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... Finding people is Difficult as hell
27.02.23, 10:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're literally talking about all the things we can do, maybe even changing up our whole research target group
27.02.23, 10:27 - Niki: Damm okay well, you still havee enough time so I guess you still can
27.02.23, 10:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... We'll see what happens, but the mood today is immaculate, everyone is agreeing on the fact that this sucks, so we're getting along great! (gotta look at the positive side of things ya know?)
27.02.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got a rocket league introduction by my teammate, fucking love these people, we're doing nothing useful today 😂
27.02.23, 11:16 - Niki: Sounds relaxing hope they don't catch your group slacking off.
27.02.23, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, our coach is only going to be here around 12, we'll be fine + he's a nice guy, we'll just say we're taking a break
27.02.23, 11:59 - Niki: Shopping right now but we couldn't find the Tabasco rasbary Chipotle 🥲
27.02.23, 12:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, didn't think so but thanks for looking! 😘
27.02.23, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We literally just gossiped about teachers and the school with our coach... I fucking love him he's great
27.02.23, 15:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We literally told him we want to kill our client (Ruben's fault) and he was totally chill about it... Madman
27.02.23, 15:36 - Niki: xD love the dynamic in the group. He seems like a great project dad
27.02.23, 15:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He is 😂
27.02.23, 15:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
27.02.23, 15:45 - Niki: Going great. Went to my grandparents they talk a lot but well we didn't see each other since the birthday on the 13.01 this year. And now I relaxing till Marco comes over around 17:00 to watch some trash movies 😁. When does your dancing class/group start?
27.02.23, 15:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm at the town Hall now to get my ID renewed, hopefully I'll be out of here soon 😅, dancing starts at 19 so I still have some time 😊
Ah, grandparents always talk a lot! But it's nice, shows they care! Have fun with Marco, trash movies are great 😁
27.02.23, 15:51 - Niki: I thought you still have uni until 16:00. Yeah hope everything goes fast at the town hall. Yeah I love them but after an hour of no stop talk I need a break will visit them again in 3 weeks.
27.02.23, 15:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah well... You see, we've collectively decided that staying for 8  hours is bullshit so we're probably never going to do that + I had official business so I had a good excuse anyway! Gonna drive home now, so if you send anything I'll respond in like 10 mins 😊
27.02.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Next week I'm definitely going to leave earlier too 😁
27.02.23, 16:14 - Niki: okay i have nothing against that
27.02.23, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd sure hope not 😘
27.02.23, 16:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, remember the box of licorice & cinnamon tea you got me in Norway? I found it in a shop here too!
27.02.23, 16:23 - Niki: It is pretty good tea to be honest
27.02.23, 16:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is! I bought another box 😁 and just now spilled the tea all over the couch 😁😅
27.02.23, 16:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (also a secret between us  but it kinda reminds me of you so yeah idk)
27.02.23, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun with Marco and the trash movies 😁😘
27.02.23, 23:10 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
27.02.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
28.02.23, 08:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How were trashy movies with Marco yesterday? And what are you up to today?
28.02.23, 08:22 - Niki: Movie was really hilarious so bad but so bad 😂. After that I just eat and went to bed. How was the dance class yesterday? How long do you "train" a dance btw? Today only real thing plant is to go cut my hair. Do you have any thing plan for today except work? Was the meeting with Tabasco today?
28.02.23, 08:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a great time! Dance class was good, but we had a bit of improv which I'm not great at. We train a couple of weeks, so next week we start a new dance normally. Please send me a picture of your new hair! Yeah, we're going for dinner with my grandpa, it was his birthday yesterday. Tabasco is coming tomorrow
28.02.23, 10:42 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
28.02.23, 10:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You look cute 😘
28.02.23, 10:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I also absolutely suck at taking selfies)
28.02.23, 12:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They completely changed their mind since last week 😅... Last week we weren't allowed to do anything and this week they're just throwing things at us 😅
28.02.23, 12:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Interesting internship for sure
28.02.23, 12:42 - Niki: I hope it's not too much. What did the other interns say about it?
28.02.23, 13:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So far it's fine, just had a tiny panic because I had to send an email 😅 the other interns have the same opinion as me, but overall we're just happy we get to do things now
28.02.23, 14:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
28.02.23, 14:15 - Niki: Well yes but it will grow i guess so not really
28.02.23, 14:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no... It's a fake plant 😅
28.02.23, 14:16 - Niki: Okay then no 😅
28.02.23, 14:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No it's not too big or yes it is definitely not a good fit?
28.02.23, 14:17 - Niki: Yeah its not a good fit.
28.02.23, 14:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ugh... Goddamn, I guess we'll try to make it work nonetheless
28.02.23, 14:20 - Niki: Sorry 😅 but well it's okay it doesn't look too weird

28.02.23, 15:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still working on it 😅... Now it's about the placement
28.02.23, 15:58 - Niki: Okay hope you find the perfect spot. Just image interns running around placing plants and the step back to taking a look if it's fine 😅
28.02.23, 15:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's basically it 😅
28.02.23, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Second week and working overtime... 😅
28.02.23, 18:07 - Niki: Can you go early another time?
28.02.23, 18:08 - Niki: I would rather work late then finish it another day. Because you need to get back in it.
28.02.23, 18:09 - Niki: Kinda suck. Hope you still have sometime between the dinner with your family and get off work 🙏🏼
28.02.23, 18:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

09.03.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... You can I guess? I'll have to lock my bike better though
09.03.23, 17:17 - Niki: So yes?
09.03.23, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure
09.03.23, 17:18 - Niki: Okay omw
09.03.23, 17:34 - Niki: Here

09.03.23, 17:35 - Niki: Standort: https://maps.google.com/?q=51.0578807,3.7427978
09.03.23, 17:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, omw
10.03.23, 09:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was early! + Alex has class until 3 so definitely only comes afterwards :)
10.03.23, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
10.03.23, 11:40 - Niki: Doing good though about taking a shower now. Cleaned our mess upstairs and watch some YouTube videos. How about you still shit task to do?
10.03.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp... Still scheduling meetings and looking at pet food. The pet food is actually not that bad. Now they also want me to stalk the people we're gonna meet with... It's great. + I have a headache from staring at my screen all day long but yeah... Risks of the job or something. Enjoy the shower (without me 😜)😘
10.03.23, 11:46 - Niki: Sadly with out you 🥲🥰. Hope stalking them is at least abit fun. It can help to turn of the blue light on the screen. Probably the main cause of the headache. If the pc / monitor can do this.
10.03.23, 11:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... I'll check if it's possible, thanks for the tip 😘
Stalking them is probably a little fun, I'm having more fun making the excel sheet now though 😁
10.03.23, 12:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I turned on the nightlight function and it was immediately a lot better... Thank you 😘❤️
10.03.23, 13:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can just take Alex and Aeneas with you shopping for snacks? No clue what we're doing for dinner though... And you better eat those pastas for lunch
10.03.23, 13:45 - Niki: Yeah will do. I also have no idea what we are gone eat. Yeah gone make myself lunch now. How is work?
10.03.23, 13:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Work is okay, we all took an hour break 😅, was fun. Shocked people by saying I was 6 when the 2008 financial crisis happened. Or well, more like I made them feel very old 😅
10.03.23, 13:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have a nice meal, how's your day going other than that?
10.03.23, 13:49 - Niki: Pretty good mostly relaxing thought. Need to do something productive now. Probably programming or some university stuff
10.03.23, 13:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just so you know, my parents just sent a message that there might not be water in our street right now, they're working on it or something
10.03.23, 13:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So maybe don't try to use water
10.03.23, 13:53 - Niki: Okay
10.03.23, 14:55 - Niki: Somebody came over now and gave me a postcard for you. I was so confused. I understood him but still the accent aaah.
10.03.23, 14:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What 😂... How did he look??
10.03.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, Alex will probably be late, only around 18 or something because she forgot they're striking today 😂
10.03.23, 14:57 - Niki: Some old guy from the neighborhood. Just said the postman fuckt it up so he came over to give it to me.
10.03.23, 15:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohhh, okay, I see. It's just a letter or what?
10.03.23, 15:06 - Niki: Just a letter with your name on it didn't look inside so no idea
10.03.23, 15:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Huh, didn't think I'd get a letter from anyone but okay, nice I guess?
10.03.23, 15:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll check it out when I get home then
10.03.23, 16:48 - Niki: Any ideas what we can make for dinner
10.03.23, 16:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uh... No?
10.03.23, 16:49 - Niki: Okay we will figure something out
10.03.23, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you really don't know anything, just take some frozen pizzas
10.03.23, 16:59 - Niki: Na we got something
10.03.23, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going home now, be there in about 20
12.03.23, 15:52 - Niki: Took a small break. What are you up to?
12.03.23, 15:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing much, just chatting with Alex and Jinte. Jinte is finishing up her rat skin 😅... Where about are you right now and how's the drive going? 😘
12.03.23, 15:55 - Niki: Going great will write more later
12.03.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found what you (we) forgot this time: your shower gel (more like you asked me to take your things from the bathroom and I completely forgot you still had shower gel in the shower 😅, sorry ❤️)
12.03.23, 17:18 - Niki: No worrys 😘
12.03.23, 19:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte just asked me what the difference is between love and good friendship and I sent her a 6 minute voice note... It's only 6 minutes because I didn't know how to explain it properly... This is your fault 😭❤️
12.03.23, 19:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I hope your drive is going well 😘
12.03.23, 21:00 - Niki: Finally home Jesus so much traffic for a Sunday. Wait why is it my fault? I would save attraction and a another feeling that I can't discribe really 😘
12.03.23, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm glad you're finally home! That was a pretty long drive, are you tired? Yeah, I find it really hard to describe too, attraction definitely though, but other than that I find it really hard to say anything other that it just feels right and comfortable? Idk... It's your fault because you make me feel these things (not blaming you for anything except being too loveable) 😘
12.03.23, 21:21 - Niki: Yeah I am kinda tired and this weeks gone be exhausting too. So I am going to bed now 😘
12.03.23, 21:21 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
12.03.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a good idea. Goodnight ❤️
13.03.23, 07:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, I just realised I never asked what you had to be home for today 😅... So what are you up to today?
13.03.23, 08:00 - Niki: Good morning. I need to move into the apartment and some task from my parents and work. What's the plan for you today? Still going with Alex to her class? By the way I had a really nice dream. I dreamed that you where in my hometown and we would go to a summer camp together. But I realized it was a dream short befor I woke up 🥲
13.03.23, 08:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I figured you had to move, just wasn't sure. Good luck with the moving and the tasks! 😘 
I'm going to school, probably gonna go to class with Alex and then to dance class afterwards. I'm sorry, I wish I was there too ❤️
I'm booking my train ride there today
13.03.23, 09:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
13.03.23, 09:19 - Niki: Damm well that's long. I don't care which one you take
13.03.23, 09:19 - Niki: Never mind can't read
13.03.23, 09:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not that long, you drive that!
13.03.23, 09:22 - Niki: Yeah well it doesn't seem that long for me to be honest. But seeing it now wow. Put it in my calendar 😘.
13.03.23, 09:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, that's why I'm always telling you to take breaks, it feels really long when you're driving to me 😅
13.03.23, 09:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should I take reserved places on German trains? I have no clue how it works 😅
13.03.23, 09:36 - Niki: Well not really because it doesn't work most of the time. Except if you need like if you are handy capt. Else they don't really give a shit
13.03.23, 09:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, good to know, thank you 😘
13.03.23, 09:37 - Niki: How BAP going a long any noticeable process?
13.03.23, 09:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, we're actually working right now so I guess so? Probably won't last too long though 😅
Everyone is also here for once, it's kinda nice
13.03.23, 09:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have you started yet? And if so, how's it going?
13.03.23, 09:41 - Niki: Need to go too my grandparents first so waiting for that (around 12). I need to get my desk too. But I need to call then furniture shop first. They open at 10. After all that I drive to the apparment and unpack everything
13.03.23, 09:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh dear, busy day! Think you'll get everything done today or you'll be on it for a few more? Definitely send me some pictures when it's done 😘
13.03.23, 09:49 - Niki: Will do. I hope not because the other days I have also stuff planned and I want to be done in one day
13.03.23, 09:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I hope you get it all done today then!
13.03.23, 13:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm drinking your Arizona right now 😁
Honestly though, you guys left like chocolate and all that, I'm taking advantage of it 😜
13.03.23, 13:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going?
13.03.23, 13:35 - Niki: Going great getting my stuff into the apartment now
13.03.23, 13:35 - Niki: Feel free
13.03.23, 13:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice!
13.03.23, 17:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
13.03.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How are things progressing?
13.03.23, 17:58 - Niki: Thx I settled in by now. I am still missing a desk because the plat of the desk is not here. It takes a another week to get to the wood shop but everything else is here. Ah and my closet is still in use by the other guy. So it looks a bit messy 😅
13.03.23, 17:58 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
13.03.23, 17:58 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
13.03.23, 17:59 - Niki: I also forget my bed sheets 😅
13.03.23, 17:59 - Niki: How was your day at work?
13.03.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Looks pretty nice! You're gonna get your bedsheets tomorrow then? Doesn't look that messy for having just moved in honestly, my room was much worse 😅
13.03.23, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We worked on the BAP at school, missed our first important deadline but that honestly was not our fault. Left early though, so that was nice. I think I was home around 2:45.
13.03.23, 18:02 - Niki: Yeah will get my bed sheets tomorrow probably or Friday if I am to lazy. It looks to messy for me 😅
13.03.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh dear, what you must have thought of my room then 😅
13.03.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tuesday or Friday... Bit of a difference but as long as you're comfortable doesn't matter I guess
13.03.23, 18:05 - Niki: Ah yeah right today is Monday I am completely of with the day I don't know why 😅. Wait what happened I thought you were good in time. The other teams where way worse.
13.03.23, 18:05 - Niki: It didn't look that messy also because you have two rooms kinda so yeah
13.03.23, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, don't worry about it. My parents always forget as well 😂
We were great on time, but then our client had to be super strict and deny our project plan twice in the last week so yeah... Sent in a third draft today and she hasn't responded yet... Not our fault because other groups could literally send their clients a project plan that reads "Coffee?" And they'd probably still accept it 😅
13.03.23, 18:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I guess, no but my room is kinda messy, I really should get rid of at least half the things I have 😅
13.03.23, 18:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you doing now then? Just relaxing?
13.03.23, 18:15 - Niki: Just relaxing and some university stuff
13.03.23, 18:17 - Niki: And looking at Alex playing minecraft and talk abit. What about you?
13.03.23, 18:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds pretty chill! I hope you enjoy yourself 😘
I'm just eating food now, going to dance later and then... I'll see
13.03.23, 20:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got home, dance was nice. How's your evening going?
13.03.23, 20:35 - Niki: We are watching matrix resurrection its awful. We don't like it at all but we have fun ranting about it so everything is fine. Any plans for tonight or just sleep?
13.03.23, 20:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds fun, I won't watch it then if it's that bad 😂
Nah, nothing planned except a shower, but I probably won't be going to sleep anytime soon 😅
13.03.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you hear anything from Aeneas about his internship today?
13.03.23, 22:07 - Niki: No not yet will probably ask him tomorrow though. Going to sleep now 😘
13.03.23, 22:07 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
13.03.23, 22:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okido, I'm gonna send him a message now, will see if he answers
13.03.23, 22:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
13.03.23, 22:08 - Niki: Tell me what he said
13.03.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He had a very good day! Nice people, very nice office, they even have a shower and one of those basketball arcade machines?? He shares his table with 2 other people for now but they'll probably be sent out to another company soon. Also a casual dresscode so he can continue to wear his cargo pants 😁
14.03.23, 08:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Whatcha up to today love?
14.03.23, 08:42 - Niki: Watching Sopranos and unpacking some more. Also need to go to the store later befor lunch
14.03.23, 08:42 - Niki: What about you any plans after work today?
14.03.23, 08:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sopranos is always nice
14.03.23, 08:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing much, my grandpa might come over for dinner but idk yet
14.03.23, 09:02 - Niki: Sounds nice how is work going still reading invitations?
14.03.23, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, now compiling a list of everyone that is going 😅
14.03.23, 09:12 - Niki: Wow your boss really gives you the hard task Damm. But they are really interesting
14.03.23, 09:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not at all... I've gone over these people 20 times already, I'm learning nothing new at all 😅
14.03.23, 09:15 - Niki: Yeah your tasks fucking sucks. Hope you get some better tasks soon
14.03.23, 09:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, the convention starts on Thursday sooo... I should get something else to do soon!
14.03.23, 09:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was wrong, still sending invitations 😅😭
14.03.23, 13:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We had free soup today, guess working here isn't so bad (I'm joking, I complain too much)
14.03.23, 13:10 - Niki: Well at least something 😅 was the soup good?
14.03.23, 13:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The soup was great! We're also getting cake now, it's our CEO's birthday apparently 😅
14.03.23, 13:14 - Niki: Nice i mean the reason doesnt matter really as long as the cake is free
14.03.23, 13:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very true
14.03.23, 13:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
14.03.23, 15:09 - Niki: Nothing much just more unpacking. What about you?
14.03.23, 15:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I may finally be done with sending invitations (in my parents' words: inshallah)
14.03.23, 15:12 - Niki: Well now the list of the people?
14.03.23, 15:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also done 😁
14.03.23, 15:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have kind of finished all the work I had to do today 😅
14.03.23, 15:14 - Niki: So you just sitting there now and work on your BAP
14.03.23, 15:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, my boss is checking over my work now, I'll see what happens after that
14.03.23, 15:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's also nothing to do about my BAP at the moment 😅
14.03.23, 18:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got home. Whatcha up to? Still unpacking or did you finish that?
14.03.23, 18:34 - Niki: Nothing much now just watching massiv Talent.
14.03.23, 18:35 - Niki: What about you?
14.03.23, 18:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice! Is it good? Nothing much, talking to my mom, well, more like her saying that everyone around me is 'too nice'... 😂
14.03.23, 18:44 - Niki: Yeah it's good really good. Why are we too nice? 😅🥰
14.03.23, 18:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cool, I'll have to watch it then!
14.03.23, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not sure nice is the correct translation honestly... The Dutch word is 'braaf', I think she's just saying that the combined evilness or edgyness of the people around me would probably be 0 and she doesn't really like it too much for some reason? It's always funny to me how she wants me to do the exact opposite of what most parents would want their kids to do 😂
14.03.23, 18:48 - Niki: xD
14.03.23, 18:49 - Niki: Yeah I think she just wants you to "life" and make mistakes but well you can't force mistakes I guess 😅
14.03.23, 18:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... I know she wants that and like, I kinda do too, but like you say you can't force mistakes and I am too cautious most of the time anyway 😅
14.03.23, 19:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although now I think about it, you do tend to take away my caution at times... Good thing my mom doesn't know about that though 😜😘
14.03.23, 19:37 - Niki: Well yeah goes both ways 😘
14.03.23, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you send Aeneas a message?
14.03.23, 20:37 - Niki: ah fuck thanks for reminding me.
14.03.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm the best I know
14.03.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (jk)
14.03.23, 20:39 - Niki: Why Jk ?its true  😘
14.03.23, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😘
14.03.23, 20:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So we're calling Aeneas tomorrow?
14.03.23, 20:46 - Niki: Yeah i think so
14.03.23, 20:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I kind of feel like we're parents to a son that is studying abroad or something 😂
14.03.23, 20:49 - Niki: yeah kinda feels like it
14.03.23, 20:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wait a second
14.03.23, 20:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When did they start calling us mom and dad?
14.03.23, 20:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm connecting the dots
14.03.23, 20:51 - Niki: I think it was the trip when I realized it first 😅.
14.03.23, 20:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... they were basically shipping us... These dumbarses 😂... Wow, how the fuck did we not even notice that 😭
14.03.23, 20:52 - Niki: Yeah well they knew befor we did so yeah
14.03.23, 20:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know, but damn, the more I figure out, the more I question exactly how much I need better glasses and hearing aids because DAMN I was blind _and_ deaf
14.03.23, 20:54 - Niki: Same love but well we got there in the Ende
14.03.23, 20:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... You're right, that is all that matters ❤️
14.03.23, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still watching movies? How was the end of Massive Talent? (No spoilers please)
14.03.23, 20:58 - Niki: The Ende was good. I am now chilling with Alex and some other friends of us but mostly  his friends. What about you?
14.03.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just watching something (not sure what) with my parents
14.03.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I asked, it's Good Cop apparently
14.03.23, 21:01 - Niki: Sounds relaxing never heard of the show though but is it good?
14.03.23, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's pretty good so far, we've only been watching for 15 mins. It's about a good cop and his corrupt ex-cop dad
14.03.23, 22:05 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
14.03.23, 22:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
15.03.23, 08:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, what does your day look like today? 😘
15.03.23, 09:01 - Niki: Good morning my love. My plans for today is looking at my grandfather old PCs and cleaning everything on it 🥲 that's gone take a while. Find a new gym in the city. What about you any plans except work for today and whats your next task at work? Did your BAP Question hot excepted?
15.03.23, 09:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with the computer and the gym! I have no plans, other than calling Aeneas and you at some point tonight. No clue what my next task is 😅...
Our BAP... Did not get accepted again... I'm really irritated about it so I'd rather not load that off on you by talking about it 😅❤️
15.03.23, 09:10 - Niki: You can rant to me if you want to no worrys. Hope you have a nice day at work 🥰😘
15.03.23, 09:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love 😘❤️
I appreciate it
15.03.23, 09:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found the next task: assessing all the marketing banners we have 😅 and inventorise them
15.03.23, 10:06 - Niki: Sounds like a pain in the ass but well what do you wanna do🥲
15.03.23, 10:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly 😅... But hey, at least I get a nice chat with Gerardo out of it?
15.03.23, 10:14 - Niki: Well atleast you share the pain of the shity work
15.03.23, 10:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Facts, it's also really funny to hear him curse, never heard that before 😂
15.03.23, 10:17 - Niki: He was Argentinarar or what ever you call people from Argentina. So he curse in Spanish or English?
15.03.23, 10:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Argentinian I guess? He curses in both, it's a lovely combination
15.03.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why do you have to clean out your grandpa's computer?
15.03.23, 12:17 - Niki: He ask for it for a long time now. So I need to do it at some point so yeah. Manly because he keeps asking me for it.
15.03.23, 12:19 - Niki: He wants to still keep using the internet and wants to be "connected" and all but at some point he give me a headache because he keeps changing everything and dowmloading random shit that I neexmd to clean up 🥲
15.03.23, 12:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahh... I get it, I have to show my grandparents how to do so many things on their computer too 😅
It's good that they keep trying to keep up though, even if it is a small headache for us
15.03.23, 12:21 - Niki: Yeah it's nice that they wanna keep up
15.03.23, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, small update: Alex has 18 sets of dice now... I swear to god that bag is worth a fortune
15.03.23, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's probably 400€ worth of dice in there 😭
15.03.23, 12:27 - Niki: Well there are nice dices in the bag. She will get a second bag or a even bigger one soon
15.03.23, 12:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very true, but I'm slightly disturbed by the fact that I know she has 4 sets that are worth €200 together 😅
And she's definitely getting an even fancier bag next 😅
15.03.23, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Someone here is trying to literally buy my time with chocolate and it is the funniest thing ever.
Dude literally asked if I'm difficult to crack... 😂
(For the record he wants me to help him organise products and he's trying to bribe me into doing it)
15.03.23, 13:28 - Niki: Is it atleast more interesting that what you need to do now?
15.03.23, 13:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, not really, but I used chat GPT for the first time so that was interesting, I'm having more fun with it anyway! 😊
15.03.23, 13:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
15.03.23, 13:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And he has not bought my time yet, so I have no clue if it would be interesting or not
15.03.23, 13:31 - Niki: Chat Gpt is really fun to play around and it can help a lot. It's really useful at some points.
15.03.23, 13:31 - Niki: My day is going fine still working on my grandparents PC it's a mess
15.03.23, 13:32 - Niki: What was his last bet for your time?
15.03.23, 13:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it gave me an email template I was already working on for a hour in just seconds, very convenient!
15.03.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He said he'll give me anything I want from a whole box of international foods. So, now we're meeting at 4 to see what's possible
15.03.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... Making any progress at least?
15.03.23, 13:33 - Niki: Yeah but slowly but I am getting there
15.03.23, 13:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just playing hard to get because he asked if I'm difficult to crack 😁, I'd have helped him anyway
15.03.23, 13:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's at least something!
15.03.23, 13:34 - Niki: Yeah will see if I get it done today 🥲
15.03.23, 13:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would burn a candle for your success but I am at work now, will burn one if I get home and you're still working on it!
15.03.23, 13:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (also is that just a Belgian thing to burn a candle for luck or is it more widespread?)
15.03.23, 13:36 - Niki: No worrys is just really boring
15.03.23, 13:36 - Niki: Yeah I think so never heard of it in Germany you only burn candles for some one how died
15.03.23, 13:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good to know about that, I wouldn't want to accidentally say someone died 😅
15.03.23, 14:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have such a nice task right now... I'm so happy 😁
15.03.23, 14:46 - Niki: Wait what's your task? Helping your coworker?
15.03.23, 14:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, that's later, but for now I am looking up holidays around the world and figuring if we can market anything food related with them 😁
15.03.23, 14:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So far: st Patrick's Day, 4th of may, Midsummer, Oktoberfest, 5th of November (probably too niche) & 16th of December -> 250th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party
15.03.23, 14:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you know any other interesting holidays, please let me know 😊😘
15.03.23, 14:52 - Niki: Will think about it ☺️
15.03.23, 17:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you manage to finish your grandpa's computer?

16.03.23, 08:21 - Niki: Only at 7 I was surprised by myself. Finishing my grandparents PC and some university stuff. How was your night?
What are your plans for today?
16.03.23, 08:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, I thought you finished that yesterday! How many hours does it take damn... 😅 I slept pretty well last night, think I got more than 8 hours of sleep! And I woke up at 7:30 by myself, honestly I was impressed by myself! I'm just going to work, nothing else planned, well, other than our date tonight 😘
16.03.23, 08:34 - Niki: I think i will be done soon. 8 hours of sleep is important hope you have a great day at work and it's not too tiring 😘
16.03.23, 08:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope so too, no clue what my tasks are going to be today 😅. I hope you're finished soon so you can do some fun things today as well ❤️
16.03.23, 10:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just spent an hour going through vapes and snus... + 1 pack of cigarettes... Working at this company sure gives me experiences I never expected to have
16.03.23, 10:18 - Niki: Well the more you know
16.03.23, 10:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, you could say that
16.03.23, 13:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You finish setting up your grandpa's computer?
16.03.23, 13:38 - Niki: Not yet I am to lazy to do it till now
16.03.23, 13:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, better get to it so you're done ya know? But I totally get it, procrastination for the win ;p
16.03.23, 13:42 - Niki: Yeah will do it now 😅
16.03.23, 13:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good boy ;)
16.03.23, 14:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently Anthony wasn't aware we're still playing DnD... I... I have a really hard time believing that honestly
16.03.23, 14:14 - Niki: I don't know benefit of the doubt mabye 🤔
16.03.23, 14:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess I will give him that but it's sad if it's true, and even sadder if it isn't 😅
16.03.23, 16:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What is your all time favourite dish? Or, alternatively, if you could only eat 1 food for the rest of your life, what would it be?
16.03.23, 16:08 - Niki: My brain says Noodle with some good tomatoe Soße. But my heart says my mum's (eierkuchen) Pancakes. You?
16.03.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have absolutely no clue, but probably some kind of pasta/noodles as well...
16.03.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
16.03.23, 16:11 - Niki: Just procrastinating with very little progress but it's okay. I need to give the pc tomorrow back. So I can't really procrastinat much more 😄
16.03.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Crunch time always works 😅
16.03.23, 16:14 - Niki: It's true though. I have a terrible work ethic if I don't want to 😅
16.03.23, 16:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same... Kind of doing it right now... Then again, I also know that if I finish this assignment I won't have anything else to do
16.03.23, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've spent the last 30 minutes just playing around with ChatGPT... I have no regrets but damn... It is way too entertaining
16.03.23, 16:55 - Niki: It's pretty funny and kinda scary because that's not even the best version of chat gbt 😅
16.03.23, 16:55 - Niki: GPT
16.03.23, 16:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... I know... It's fucking scary
16.03.23, 16:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, it fucking understood me when I made a word joke... 😅
16.03.23, 16:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I asked for a peach cobbler recipe and said 'thanks, you're a peach' afterwards... Understood me 😭
16.03.23, 16:57 - Niki: Damm that it gets you humor 😂
16.03.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This thing terrifies me
16.03.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I do get why people have gone insane over it now
16.03.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's really like you're talking to an omniscient person
16.03.23, 16:59 - Niki: It's God 😅
16.03.23, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, God wouldn't be so gullible 😂
16.03.23, 17:00 - Niki: Mabye who knows? Would love to play a dnd scene with the idea 😄
16.03.23, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, for sure! I also asked it to give me a schedule to learn German in 3 weeks, honestly it's really useful! And dinner ideas!!
16.03.23, 17:01 - Niki: xD it's your personal assistance
16.03.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No but realize this: anytime we don't know what to eat just ask chatGPT for a few options, throw it in the Wheel of Names and tadzam, no need to make any decisions :)))
16.03.23, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then again, eh, I kinda like looking through cooking books, we'll see
16.03.23, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now I have to waste another half hour here... What shall I do?
16.03.23, 17:04 - Niki: I have no idea what you could do to be honest.
16.03.23, 17:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll figure something out I guess 😅
16.03.23, 17:06 - Niki: You can obviously write with me the howl time if you have a something we can talk about for half a hour. Only if you want and have nothing to do
16.03.23, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Boy, I love talking to you and you better know it
16.03.23, 17:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't have shit to do and my neighbour (Gerardo) is talking in Spanish to one of the other employees
16.03.23, 17:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So yes 😊
16.03.23, 17:08 - Niki: Do you understand some of what they say in Spanish?
16.03.23, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, technically I'm also following along on the conference in San Francisco at the same time but eh, who cares about that (it's the welcome speech)
16.03.23, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I could if I tried to
16.03.23, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But my Spanish is pretty elemental I'm afraid, I could save myself but that's about it 😅
16.03.23, 17:09 - Niki: Don't need to just curios if the accent is to much but okay well nevermind
16.03.23, 17:09 - Niki: What's the conference about the meeting you invite everybody for your bosses
16.03.23, 17:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The accent is fine, my 2 teachers both had _bad_ accents so I'm kinda used to it
16.03.23, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, that one! It's called Future Food Tech, so it's about technology in the agrofood industry
16.03.23, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This woman gets it... Her name is Allyson Fish
16.03.23, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Perfect for a food conference no?
16.03.23, 17:11 - Niki: xD yeah she was born for it
16.03.23, 17:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Another guy on the panel is wearing a snapback... 😂
16.03.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or wait no, is that a baret??
16.03.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, I tried to schedule a meeting with him... Whoops, failed at that
16.03.23, 17:14 - Niki: Well don't play around to much or you get caught
16.03.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, no worries, I'm not really playing around + there's only 4 people at the office anyway, not a lot of people to catch me
16.03.23, 17:15 - Niki: Okay did you see we won't play dnd on Friday
16.03.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yeah, I knew it first actually, i asked Alex if they wanted to play at my place again and suddenly Alex realized that work + dnd is not very possible :(
16.03.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Welcome address was supposed to take 5 minutes... We're 20 minutes in
16.03.23, 17:17 - Niki: Well it allways takes long 😮‍💨
16.03.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... True unfortunately
16.03.23, 17:18 - Niki: But now Anthony has more time to create a character if he wants to join us. And jingwen said  we are going in a dungeon that's gone be a lot of fighting and some level ups on the way
16.03.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, I also thought so! He has a bit more than a week to create a character, should be fine! If we're levelling up in the dungeons that means I get to multiclass 😁
16.03.23, 17:21 - Niki: The character change his howl personality because of the magical and unlimited power of jogurt
16.03.23, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... Maybe, but I still don't like the gods
16.03.23, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yoghurt and ice cream are very powerful though
16.03.23, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: God knows, anyone can bribe me with good food
16.03.23, 17:23 - Niki: In a twist of events your gone be the God of food  at the Ende of the champagne
16.03.23, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That... That would be legendary
16.03.23, 17:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also a great way to get me to accept gods
16.03.23, 17:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Who can deny a thing they are themselves?
16.03.23, 17:25 - Niki: Well you can still hate them but yeah it's gone be hard especially because you get in way more contact with God's this way and you see things from there perspective
16.03.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't think Jingwen would be stupid or reckless enough to give me that much power though 😅
16.03.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very true
16.03.23, 17:26 - Niki: Yeah i thinks so too
16.03.23, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Who knows though, he might just surprise us! (If he's drugged)
16.03.23, 17:29 - Niki: I think if you can out smart him he will accept it and give you the power of a God
16.03.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why are you trying to actually get me to try and become a god? 🙃
16.03.23, 17:31 - Niki: I don't kown it would be funny for the champagne and the characters I guess
16.03.23, 17:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now I might actually try to do it "by accident"
16.03.23, 17:33 - Niki: Gone home now?
16.03.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm gonna round up and go home 😊
16.03.23, 20:01 - Niki: I need 5 more mins at least sorry 😅

17.03.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, I realised I'm not in Bergen anymore and felt unsafe at the thought of going by myself 😅
You had food that was hopefully not Greek?

19.03.23, 14:47 - Niki: We meet up like ones or twice a month and else we just play online games.
19.03.23, 14:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So now you're playing online then? But yeah, makes sense
19.03.23, 14:48 - Niki: Yeah we play online now
19.03.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just realised a moment when I was so sure you weren't into me 😂
While we were cooking our hand sizes came up or something and we compared hands... Idk about guys but it's a very obvious move to girls 😅
Anyway, you still have gorgeous hands 🥰
19.03.23, 17:25 - Niki: Yeah I was so nervous about the cooking. While we were cooking my hard was beating so fast
19.03.23, 17:27 - Niki: The hand think was really cute thought. I was mabye trying to act like I am not that into you
19.03.23, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You didn't seem like it at all 😅 but yeah, same, I felt so nervous 😅. It's just the way you acted was so casual, damn...
19.03.23, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Boy... Why the fuck would you try to act like you're not into me 😭??
19.03.23, 17:31 - Niki: I don't know why sorry 😅🥰
19.03.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're lucky you're cute and we worked it out eventually 😂😘

19.03.23, 17:36 - Niki: Love you too 🥰😘
19.03.23, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It hurts to see how much someone lights up when they get a compliment... Fuck people should get compliments more often.
19.03.23, 19:57 - Niki: Yeah why how do you get to the topic?
19.03.23, 19:57 - Niki: But yeah I try to give more compliments to friend and family
19.03.23, 20:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I complimented my cousin on her sweater and she fucking lit up like fireworks, it was adorable but also really sad
19.03.23, 20:02 - Niki: Well it's nice that she lit up. Mabye she only lit up because she looks up to you
19.03.23, 20:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd hope that's the case, but I'm afraid it's not... Knowing her like I do 😅
19.03.23, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Add songs to the playlist please, it is turning into just my songs 😭😂

19.03.23, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening going?
19.03.23, 21:24 - Niki: Doing great watching some ge of thrones with Alex
19.03.23, 21:24 - Niki: What are you up too?
19.03.23, 21:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No clue, my cousin just left so I might just watch a series or something. Are you watching GOT or House of the Dragon?
19.03.23, 21:26 - Niki: GOT. Something new from your cousin? What did you talked about?
19.03.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which season are you on?
We mainly talked about her wanting to study psychology in uni or college, but that's still 1.5 years away, then apparently her dance group was accused of plagiarism. Oh, and we also checked out some more fake tattoos. I might get one that says 'bite me' on my collarbone because why not?
19.03.23, 21:31 - Niki: "Bite me" on your collarbone. Be there done that 😏. Psychology is pretty interesting now some people that Studie it in university now and the don't complain that much as the other Study courses. 
Season 3
19.03.23, 21:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, and I wore the marks of it for a week after that 😘
Yeah, psychology is really interesting, although contemplated studying it in the past, but it does take 6 years to study in Belgium if you go to uni, so I get why she's doubting. 
Quite frankly I've never watched all of GOT, I just watched a few episodes here and there with my parents and then watched House of the Dragon 😅 do you like it?
19.03.23, 21:39 - Niki: Start watching house of dragon but only 3 episode till now its pretty good. Game of thrones has so much sex scene Jesus I forgot how much 😅
19.03.23, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, watching those with my parents was hella embarrassing 😅... I think I was 13 or something... A lot of sex scenes.... 😂
19.03.23, 22:48 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
19.03.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️
20.03.23, 07:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, I hope you slept alright. Good luck at uni today 😘
20.03.23, 08:15 - Niki: Yeah slept pretty good today. Thanks hope your Team makes good progress in the BAP today 😘
20.03.23, 08:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, doubt it but we can hope 😊😅
20.03.23, 08:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I literally got to school and all of us are pissed already... This is going to be a great day 👍
20.03.23, 09:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for enjoying my pain 😭😘
20.03.23, 09:17 - Niki: Sorry but not that much to be honest
20.03.23, 10:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also happy 3 months?? 😊😘
20.03.23, 10:32 - Niki: Oh yeah today is the 20th 🥰😘

20.03.23, 15:32 - Niki: Doing great back home now and made lunch. Have a online course at 5 so I am waiting and watching some you tube. How is your day going?
20.03.23, 15:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's nice! So you have 2 classes today then? Eh, it's alright, got some crappy feedback again but I think this time we got it! I'm waiting to get my new ID now...
20.03.23, 15:36 - Niki: Yeah I got 3 classes but one of them is without supervision. Nice at least some progress. I would hate the person so much like you were a head of time and now through that person you get set back so much.
20.03.23, 15:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, I see! Without supervision is just a work class then? You make some assignments or how does it work? 
Yeah... Our coach did something he really wasn't supposed to and showed us some work another group did... Let me put it this way, they had a document of 300 words... We have 3671 and theirs was accepted, ours wasn't... So yeah, we all hate her a lot 😅
20.03.23, 15:39 - Niki: Yeah we got some assignment and need to write a protocol for them too 😢
20.03.23, 15:40 - Niki: Hate her more the rage fuels your productivity
20.03.23, 15:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It would, if it weren't that our productivity would help her out 😅
20.03.23, 15:43 - Niki: Well fuck than just hate her and after the BAP you can rant to her
20.03.23, 15:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... First day back and already so much work!
20.03.23, 15:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll be alright 😘
20.03.23, 15:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would you be up for calling a bit when I get home? Don't have to if you'd rather relax
20.03.23, 15:47 - Niki: Yeah sure we can call 🥰
20.03.23, 15:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll be home in 10
20.03.23, 16:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://vub.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6tZf41tgfqoTba5
20.03.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
20.03.23, 21:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
20.03.23, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
20.03.23, 22:36 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
20.03.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I'm like 80% sure you're already asleep 😂)
20.03.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, 80-20 rule I guess 😂
20.03.23, 22:38 - Niki: I was have a sleep listening to music in my chair
20.03.23, 22:38 - Niki: Sorry didn't me too 😓
20.03.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know love 😘

21.03.23, 08:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning 😘
21.03.23, 08:16 - Niki: Good morning my love 😘
21.03.23, 08:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today?
21.03.23, 08:20 - Niki: Nothing much 2 course Today and going through the course from yesterday. I need to go to university for the first one in a hour. What about you? What kind of shity task you gone get today?
21.03.23, 08:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The good old uni life ;) good luck in classes!
I completely forgot this yesterday but I only have to work half a day today! So I'm grabbing lunch with Jinte and Lars and then I have an internship evaluation at school. No clue what kind of shitty task I'll get today, but I actually think we might get some training... So that's nice?
21.03.23, 08:26 - Niki: Nice sounds good. Hope the evaluation goes good. Say hi to jinte and Lars for me.
21.03.23, 08:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will do, just hope they're not awkward 😅
21.03.23, 08:28 - Niki: Yeah hope so too but they already talk befor right?
21.03.23, 08:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda? But not really? Lars actually asked Jinte to meet up for lunch by themselves but Jinte didn't feel like that so I kinda 'saved' her from that
21.03.23, 08:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm 90% sure it went something like "hey, you wanna grab lunch together?" "Oh sorry, I'm hanging out with Manon already" -> texts me to ask if I have anything to do for lunch -> back to Lars "but you can come along if you want?"
21.03.23, 08:32 - Niki: Well yeah probably something like this. It's gone be interesting. Please tell me how it was and how they were?
21.03.23, 08:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For sure! I'll let you know 😊
21.03.23, 12:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I did not end up having lunch with Jinte and Lars
21.03.23, 13:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Lars cancelled so Jinte cancelled too, and then I went and saved Alex because they forgot their wallet and couldn't get out of the parking garage 😅
21.03.23, 13:01 - Niki: Okay sad that you could eat with both of them but nice that you could save alex
21.03.23, 13:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, kinda a little pissed at Jinte for now but we're calling later today to work that out
21.03.23, 13:02 - Niki: Yeah get that mabye there is a good reason for it 🤔
21.03.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I know the exact reason, wasn't really good, but she didn't realise how it looked like to me, so I explained and now we're gonna meet up this afternoon on call. *communication*
21.03.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day?
21.03.23, 13:06 - Niki: Communication is key. Doing Great ate shit lunch at the cafeteria but well it only cost 2 euro so it's okay. Have a course in a hour and waiting for it now
21.03.23, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is the cafeteria food always bad? I had a hotdog with Alex at the fair that's going on. Was pretty good but a bit expensive. What course do you have in an hour?
21.03.23, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm waiting for my InterVision talk about my internship now 😅
21.03.23, 13:09 - Niki: Nah sometimes it's good

21.03.23, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank god it's not always bad
21.03.23, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no clue if that is interesting to you or not
21.03.23, 13:11 - Niki: It's okay need to know it and it helps with other stuff so it's kinda interesting
21.03.23, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just realized I forgot 2 assignments... FML
21.03.23, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds interesting
21.03.23, 14:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am somehow not in trouble for this 😅...
21.03.23, 14:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your class?
21.03.23, 14:26 - Niki: Prof ist just talking a lot about definitions of words we need to remember and explaining them. Like allways in the first week's 😓😮‍💨

21.03.23, 14:40 - Niki: Yeah well the prof is famous for taking longer than he has.
21.03.23, 14:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... Well... Yeah, I feel sorry for you in that case 😅
21.03.23, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So, how long over time did the prof go?
21.03.23, 17:15 - Niki: This time he didn't do it for so long 5/10 mins. What are you up to now?

22.03.23, 10:36 - Niki: Good morning my love  how is your day going?
22.03.23, 10:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning love, my day is... Going? How's yours?
22.03.23, 10:50 - Niki: So your day is not going well. What happened / what shity task you need to work on now? I woke up at 7 to go to university at 8 and the lecture was canceled and I didn't see it 🥲. So I got some free time till 14 for my next lecture.
22.03.23, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm still working on the social media targeting but I just don't really know where to go with it now 😅... I'm fucking stuck. Oh, and our project plan was rejected again 😭.
Oh shit that is so early to get up for nothing 😅... You're just staying at school the whole time? I hope you have something to fill your time with
22.03.23, 10:53 - Niki: Nah I went home again and slept till 10:00
22.03.23, 10:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Makes sense, still having a crappy sleep schedule or did you somehow miraculously fix it?
22.03.23, 10:54 - Niki: Wait your project got rejected again WTF. I would hate her with a flaming passion now
22.03.23, 10:54 - Niki: Its getting fix I would say
22.03.23, 10:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh trust me, I do
22.03.23, 10:55 - Niki: Well mabye ask one of your senior better than doing nothing I guess. Mabye they can help you with the rest of the social media targeting
22.03.23, 10:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good!
22.03.23, 10:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... I think I'm gonna try to put it in a presentation first, do some more research and then see what I'm getting at I guess?
22.03.23, 11:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So what are you gonna do while you wait for your next class?
22.03.23, 11:26 - Niki: Probably prepare for class and do some house chores. Nothing interesting to be honest mabye some other universities stuff
22.03.23, 11:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Useful things though, that's good 👍
22.03.23, 11:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just found out my company has a Pinterest account and I honestly have no clue what to do with that information 😅
22.03.23, 11:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Been 6 years since anything was posted but still
22.03.23, 12:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
22.03.23, 13:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, at least now we know I'm not pregnant but goddamn, my day keeps getting better 😅
22.03.23, 13:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope yours is better 😊
22.03.23, 13:09 - Niki: Damm sucks hope it's not that painfully this time 🙏🏼. To be honest my day is going good feel productive today.
22.03.23, 13:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess we'll see, I think it'll be fine though. I'm glad you're having a good and productive day! 😘
22.03.23, 13:12 - Niki: Thx how is the social media targeting /presentation going?
22.03.23, 13:13 - Niki: Did you eat lunch already?
22.03.23, 13:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just eating lunch right now. The presentation is kinda going alright? Will see where it goes. A new guy started today apparently, also in marketing and sales department and I had no clue before!
22.03.23, 13:16 - Niki: What do you have for lunch and did he get introduced or did you hear it from a coworker
22.03.23, 13:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I had a pretty sad lunch, not gonna lie, maiswafels with some raw carrots, had nothing else at home 😅
Yeah, he got introduced as the 'new guy' no name or anything so at lunch I asked him who he was, he's quite nice. Does graphic design apparently. Only annoying thing is that the moment he figured out I can speak Dutch he only wanted to speak Dutch... In an international company?? That's excluding people, but no clue how to say that without sounding rude 😅
22.03.23, 13:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What did you have for lunch?
22.03.23, 13:20 - Niki: Nothing till now will probably wait until 15:00. After the course
22.03.23, 13:23 - Niki: I also have no idea mabye bring in another coworker so you include him. But honestly no idea how to say it 😅
22.03.23, 13:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Boy... You better eat something good then, at least tell me you had a good breakfast
22.03.23, 13:25 - Niki: Yeah had a good breakfast no worries 😘. What about you? You better eat something when you get home or something free from the company
22.03.23, 13:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh... If it happens again I'll figure something out
22.03.23, 13:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no worries, I'll eat something when I get home. And I still have a honey waffle if I get hungry again 😊
22.03.23, 13:40 - Niki: You better 😤😘
22.03.23, 13:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out I'm basically doing the exact same assignment 2 groups of Master students did for them that finished yesterday... And everything I have so far is absolutely useless 🙃
22.03.23, 13:49 - Niki: WTF your boss is a very intelligent man 🙃. Jokes a side why the fuck did they let you work on a task somebody else was already working on??
22.03.23, 13:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have absolutely no clue... Wasn't even my boss that gave me this assignment, was my mentor... Pretty sure she gave it to me because she didn't know what else I could do and now I will still somehow feel shitty if I give bad work. I have to compete against 2 groups of master students that got to work on this for a month??
22.03.23, 13:56 - Niki: Well you can tell her that you don't like working on useless stuff and it's okay if you give her a worse version than the master because you had less time.
22.03.23, 14:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... I think I'm just gonna 'work on it' for today, finish it and hope I get something else to do tomorrow, not gonna stress over it too much. Have fun (?) in class!
22.03.23, 14:04 - Niki: thx
22.03.23, 16:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So, you eat something good? 😘
22.03.23, 17:06 - Niki: Yeah also went shopping with Alex for groceries
22.03.23, 17:06 - Niki: You done with work now?
22.03.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Smart
22.03.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, 15 more minutes, though I doubt anyone would say anything if I left right now
22.03.23, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now I'm done and I'm going home and I'm gonna eat a cookie or something
22.03.23, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
22.03.23, 17:38 - Niki: Pls more than a cookie 🥰
22.03.23, 17:39 - Niki: Playing some games with Elias and talking about the past and what's going on in our lives right now.
22.03.23, 17:39 - Niki: Up for date night tonight?
22.03.23, 17:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me adjust my words: at least a cookie
22.03.23, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For sure! ❤️
22.03.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What time?
22.03.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, enjoy it 😊
22.03.23, 17:45 - Niki: 20:00
22.03.23, 20:01 - Niki: Call me when your ready 😘
22.03.23, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://www.thehogwartsescape.com/
22.03.23, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: black walnut dragon heart string
22.03.23, 20:51 - Niki: Transfiguration

22.03.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: flipendo rictusempra
22.03.23, 21:45 - Niki: Petrificus Totalus
22.03.23, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
22.03.23, 22:09 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
23.03.23, 07:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning, did you sleep alright? Good luck with your 4 classes ❤️
23.03.23, 08:03 - Niki: Yeah I slept great today and thx hope they are not to exhausting. How did you sleep and what are you plans at work? Did you already give them the social median targeting?
23.03.23, 08:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad you had a good night 😊
I... Had to take 2 painkillers to be able to sleep 😅...
Yeah, I finished it yesterday, I'm gonna ask for more work today, I'll see what I get
23.03.23, 08:13 - Niki: 2 painkiller Jesus Christus periods suck. Yeah hope the work you get this time is interesting and not something somebody else is already working on 🥲
23.03.23, 08:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp... Gonna take some more painkillers today because otherwise I won't get through the day 😅 I kid you not when the thought "maybe being pregnant wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to deal with this shit for 9 months" went through my head yesterday evening 😂
23.03.23, 08:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I might ask to work on the same task Gerardo is working on, he's been working on it for nearly a week and is very much over it too, together we might finish it sooner + it's not that bad of a task
23.03.23, 08:26 - Niki: Only good reason to get pregnant 😅
23.03.23, 14:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the full day of classes? Still alive?
23.03.23, 14:38 - Niki: It's going okay. First two are over now and the 4 is happening online 😮‍💨. One of the databases is only the teacher talking no stop and it's hard to keep up. How is your day going? Got the task you want? Did you eat lunch with jinte?
23.03.23, 14:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So 1 more class! You can do it! 😘
Sounds difficult to keep track of yeah, good luck!
My day's going good, on my way to the graduation fair now. I had a very nice lunch with Jinte, I even got to see her mom 😊
23.03.23, 14:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't get the task I wanted but it's fine, I have enough things to do and they're not so bad
23.03.23, 14:42 - Niki: Hope you the graduation fair is helpful good luck there 😘
23.03.23, 14:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love ❤️
23.03.23, 15:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jesus Christ this is so overwhelming
23.03.23, 19:12 - Niki: Wait what you mean with overwhelming. The people or the so much stands and in a good or bad way? Ohh I didn't sent it at 4 well sorry 😅
23.03.23, 19:13 - Niki: How was the graduation fair? Found something new? How is your body doing still in a shit load of pain?
23.03.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just... Everything? I ran into a bunch of people I know, some of the people behind the stands would just start talking to you out of nowhere and there was just so much going on 😅
But hey, I got a free cookie so it wasn't all bad!
23.03.23, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't find anything new, I think I'm gonna stick with the plan: Trade engineering in Antwerp next year. Just gotta decide if I want to do classic (science based) or more ICT based
Eh, my body is under control, nothing some painkillers can't handle. How was your day? Were your classes alright? I hope you're not too tired now 😘
23.03.23, 19:19 - Niki: Yeah I am good the rest of the classes were pretty chill. Sounds like a lot happen today. Hope you can get some rest till tomorrow and on the weekend.
23.03.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's nice, glad it wasn't too bad. Yeah, I'll see. I'm calling Aeneas at 8 and after that I think I might watch The Last of Us with my dad (maybe)
23.03.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you gonna do tonight? Relax?
23.03.23, 19:23 - Niki: Yeah relax and do some review on the lectures
23.03.23, 19:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Such a good student, I'm really impressed
23.03.23, 21:34 - Niki: Its not as impressive as you think I just have it open while I watch some YouTube 😅
23.03.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just take the compliment love!
It's still kinda impressive that you're doing anything at all, like I said before, most of the students I know wouldn't do shit until a week before the exam!
23.03.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm also meeting up with Aeneas on Sunday. We're going to a cat cafe
23.03.23, 21:44 - Niki: Nice tell me everything after the cat Cafe. I will talk with him tomorrow too
23.03.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will do. Please ask him about the girl he lives with, she's kinda... Weird from what he told me today 😅
23.03.23, 21:48 - Niki: Okay will do but I think I am going to bed now 😘
23.03.23, 21:48 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
23.03.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
23.03.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I miss you)
23.03.23, 21:49 - Niki: Miss you too 🥹😘
24.03.23, 07:56 - Niki: Good morning my love 😘
24.03.23, 07:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning 😘
24.03.23, 07:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How'd you sleep?
24.03.23, 08:04 - Niki: Pretty great how about you?
24.03.23, 08:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also pretty good!
24.03.23, 08:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today? I'm guessing class and calling Aeneas, anything else?
24.03.23, 08:08 - Niki: Yeah only classes and Aeneas for today. Alex wanted to go somewhere on the weekend so I don't know if that's happening today or even if it is happening at all
24.03.23, 08:09 - Niki: What are you doing today? Sadly dnd is canceled so any plans for the evening?
24.03.23, 08:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, I hope you have fun if you go somewhere! I'm just going to work. My colleagues are going out for drinks after but I'm not sure if I want to go yet
24.03.23, 08:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, there also is a photographer coming by work today to take photos of the new people... 😅
24.03.23, 08:30 - Niki: It's like school again photo day 😅. If they take a picture of you would you be so kind to send it to me 🥰
24.03.23, 08:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp... It does feel that way, except I decided I shouldn't dress up, I'm just going in my usual clothes. If I get the picture I'll send it to you 😅😘
24.03.23, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I remember I forgot to tell you something. Jinte ran into Lars on Wednesday. She asked what he was up to and he said he was gonna buy his books... The reason why he couldn't have lunch with Jinte and I on Tuesday... What the fuck does this mean?? 🙃
24.03.23, 09:33 - Niki: Well either it was just a lame excuse he used on Tuesday or he need to get more books or foil them or didn't get them all. I would give him benefits of the doubt but I don't know him that well 😅
24.03.23, 09:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would give him the benefit of the doubt as well, were it not that Jinte  asked him about it and he quickly left without answering 😅
24.03.23, 09:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I'm pretty sure it's not something personal against me but it's still odd
24.03.23, 09:37 - Niki: Yeah seems weird but the relationship between the two is still a bit off I think
24.03.23, 09:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, true, it's weird... I hope it gets straightened out soon
24.03.23, 12:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: People at my internship place are insane... 1 of my colleagues is pretty much stalking a guy because he doesn't answer her emails about a project we did in 2018 😅
24.03.23, 12:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How are your classes going?
24.03.23, 12:10 - Niki: Jesus don't want to be on her bad side 😅
24.03.23, 12:11 - Niki: Classes are over now and I only need to do some assignment today. Weekend is free 🥳
24.03.23, 12:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Indeed you don't, she also told me about her last job where she needed a specific product number or something and the guy just didn't give it to her (forgot or something) so for 2 months she would place post-its everywhere on his desk until he told her 😅
24.03.23, 12:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hurrah!
24.03.23, 12:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When tonight are you calling Aeneas?
24.03.23, 12:16 - Niki: No sure but around 21 I think
24.03.23, 12:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's pretty late
24.03.23, 12:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If it's indeed that late... Would you want to call a little before that? Idk if you have time
24.03.23, 12:20 - Niki: Sure sounds great
24.03.23, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hate having my picture taken 😅... The guy literally just arrived and I already feel stressed when I don't even have to pose or anything 😭
24.03.23, 15:04 - Niki: Just his sheer presence is harm to my happiness xD
24.03.23, 15:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically 😂
24.03.23, 15:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I made it worse, the guy greeted me and our HR guy said "so Manon, you heard it, when he takes pictures act natural"
24.03.23, 15:09 - Niki: Love how your coworker is coaching you through the foto shoot. I also tough he was just taking some pictures of the environment and some people working
24.03.23, 15:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no clue, he hasn't taken any pictures yet!
24.03.23, 15:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I responded to this with "I will just act like you don't exist and it will be fine"... 😅
24.03.23, 15:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So he's taking pictures now, apparently he wants us to look natural in our work environment so he's asking us to talk to the person next to us... The conversations are hilarious
24.03.23, 15:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: "so, what's your favourite colour? You don't know the colour purple?? How do you not know it?"
24.03.23, 15:30 - Niki: Love the way he forced  conversation but atleast they are good
24.03.23, 15:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no idea if they're good or not, guess we'll find out sooner or later?
24.03.23, 16:00 - Niki: Will see hope the rest of work goes by fast 😘
24.03.23, 16:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, probably will, we're having a company meeting now ❤️
24.03.23, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Today was actually a lot of fun
24.03.23, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We got to try all kinds of exotic fruits, was really nice 😊
24.03.23, 17:23 - Niki: Nice got the same feeling for. Your text
24.03.23, 17:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ?
24.03.23, 17:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was your day so far?
24.03.23, 17:34 - Niki: Pretty nice nearly done with everything
24.03.23, 17:36 - Niki: I got the feeling that your day was good through your texts.
24.03.23, 17:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice!
24.03.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh... Yeah, I guess they were a lot more positive than usual 😅
24.03.23, 17:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love that you cycled through 3 emojis 😂
24.03.23, 17:53 - Niki: Wait you saw that 🥲. Yeah my hand are sometimes faster than my brain 😅
24.03.23, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, yeah, I'm on my phone so I see the notifications instantly 😂
24.03.23, 17:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I get it, I have the same thing happen so often
24.03.23, 17:55 - Niki: Yeah sorry was it confusing to see me react 3 times with other emojis
24.03.23, 17:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, wasn't confusing, just funny
24.03.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh look, that was only 1 😜
24.03.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, idk when you want to call/if you can?
24.03.23, 18:05 - Niki: Mabye around 8 or early I don't know
24.03.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, just call me when you want, I have nothing planned
24.03.23, 18:19 - Niki: Okay will do
24.03.23, 20:48 - Niki: You wanna call?
24.03.23, 20:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah sure, give me 5 minutes
24.03.23, 21:03 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
24.03.23, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This seems like a fair fight 😂
24.03.23, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️
24.03.23, 22:34 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
Love you 😘
24.03.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you too 🥰
25.03.23, 10:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning☀️
How'd you sleep? Any plans for today?
25.03.23, 10:18 - Niki: Good morning 🥰
I slept pretty good just woke up at 6 again 😅.
Playing and talking with ole again did talk with him for 2 weeks now so yeah that and some university stuff.
What are your plans for today and how was your sleep?
25.03.23, 10:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 6 again?? It's like you went with my parents to Oman and now you're still jetlagged 😅
I slept good but had a weird and awful dream where you broke up with me, I then went on a date with a guy I didn't like, you then said we didn't break up and then I felt like I had cheated... Weird shit 😂
I'm gonna get ready and then going out with my mom and aunt to do god knows what, should also do some uni stuff, I need to write a report by Monday. Have fun with Ole 😊
25.03.23, 10:28 - Niki: Thx will do. Love the weird dream 😅. Yeah right the brunch and then shopping with your aunt and mom. Have fun with your family
25.03.23, 10:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love ❤️
25.03.23, 11:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I convinced Anthony to join us in DnD
25.03.23, 11:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He actually said he's gonna try and make a character this time sooo, I have high hopes
25.03.23, 11:29 - Niki: That's pretty nice. Sounds promising I don't know why he needs to be convinced but good job 😘
25.03.23, 11:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anthony is like his fucking laptop. You hit it too hard, it breaks, you don't hit it, nothing happens. It's a delicate balance in letting him know we haven't forgotten him and that we still want to interact with him, while also accepting that he's probably never going to take the first step in organising a get together, even when you know he wants to be at a get together. He just wants to feel wanted sometimes, hence why I need to 'convince' him, even when both of us already know he wants to be there
25.03.23, 11:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I'm massively exaggerating things, but the essence of it is kinda true)
25.03.23, 11:35 - Niki: Ok well you get people way better than I do and thanks for 'convince' him
25.03.23, 11:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfftt, people in general are a mystery to me, but Anthony is pretty simple, especially with the way he opened up to me in Norway. All he wants is to be accepted and to feel wanted. He often feels alone, but in part that is his own fault for not reaching out to anyone himself. Oh, and he is deeply and utterly in love with Claire, which doesn't help his self esteem because he puts her on a too high pedestal, making him think he's 'unworthy' of her.
25.03.23, 11:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's Anthony in a nutshell 😊
25.03.23, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah okay, maybe I shouldn't hang out with Alex anymore... I just realised I basically psychoanalysed him and now I feel uncomfortable about that 😅
Sorry? 😅
25.03.23, 11:41 - Niki: Well you should do it with everyone but for some people it helps you understand better. So I guess don't be sorry
25.03.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... I don't like psychoanalysing everyone, but sometimes it helps to talk to them I guess? Idk, I'm just glad I didn't study psychology so I can't actually do it in depth by accident 😅
25.03.23, 14:04 - Niki: How is your day with your family going?

My day was good, at a restaurant now
25.03.23, 20:28 - Niki: Yeah on twitch with another friend of him. Going okay still has none to less than 10 people watching but he thinks it will go up at some point.

25.03.23, 23:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't mind the call 😂 Was happy to see and hear you 😘
Yeah, Instagram has had a call function for a whileeee, no clue why
25.03.23, 23:28 - Niki: Yeah sorry it was short though 🥲🥰

25.03.23, 23:29 - Niki: 🫠🥰 You make my heart melt with message like this 😘
25.03.23, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Boy, you're so hot I melt just knowing you exist, nevermind when you're doing anything at all 😘🫠
25.03.23, 23:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm actually gonna go to sleep now though, with the hour change and everything, I wanna get a good night of sleep
25.03.23, 23:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
Love you 😘
25.03.23, 23:41 - Niki: Love you too😘
Goodnight ❤️
26.03.23, 09:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, how'd you sleep? ❤️
26.03.23, 10:05 - Niki: Good morning slept good just woke up. How about you?
26.03.23, 10:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, either you stayed awake super late or the hour change fixed your sleep schedule 😂
I slept good, I'm on my way to meet Aeneas now. What are your plans for the day?
26.03.23, 10:37 - Niki: Yeah I was a awake until 2 I don't know why to be honest 🙃. I have nothing much planned some learning but that's all. Hope you have a great time with aeneas in the cat Cafe 😘
26.03.23, 10:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm on the train to get there now and picked the worst fucking seat possible 😅... With an alcoholic 😅... He started talking to me about utopia 😅...
26.03.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you have a productive/fun day 😘
26.03.23, 10:41 - Niki: Wait the song or the general idea of utopia? 😅 Hope the train ride isn't to long and if it's really bad just change seats.
26.03.23, 10:41 - Niki: Thx hope you have a fun day with aeneas 😘
26.03.23, 10:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Both... 😂
Nah, I'm getting off at the next stop, so it's not too bad. He also stopped talking to me because I'm on my phone now.
26.03.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll send you pictures!
26.03.23, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This cat cafe is amazing, way better than the one we went to in Paris!! And also way less busy, it was just Aeneas and I and then 2 other people
26.03.23, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
26.03.23, 14:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question: do you want to be an armpit model?
26.03.23, 14:25 - Niki: I guess do they see my face and do I get a shit load of money? But with out any information no. What about the two of you?
26.03.23, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, I would do it for free
26.03.23, 14:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aeneas wouldn't though, in any circumstances
26.03.23, 15:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I actually am gonna do it for free
26.03.23, 15:12 - Niki: Okay thats kinda interesting. How did you get the opportunity? And what do you need to do to be a good armpit model? 
Probably wouldn't do it for free to be honest
26.03.23, 15:12 - Niki: Me personally would do it for free.
26.03.23, 15:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, yeah nah, it's nothing professional, my cousin just has an art project that she needs people to be armpit models for, I have absolutely zero further information 😂
26.03.23, 15:18 - Niki: Okay well if it's family it's a different story. Then I would do it too. Kinda weird that they need to draw armpits but well who am I too understand the minds of artists 😅
26.03.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I don't know what she needs to do but I don't think it's drawing, she just needs a picture of it. Artists are weirddd
26.03.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How has your day been?
26.03.23, 17:16 - Niki: Pretty relaxing did my university after that I just relax till now Marco wanted to play some games now. Saw the picture of Aeneas looks really nice. How was the rest of your day?
26.03.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad you had a relaxing day 😊 (wish you could have been here though)
It was really nice, we were in the cat cafe for like 3 or 4 hours and then we walked around Kortrijk until now. It was raining the whole time but it was quite alright. We talked a lot about you actually 😅
Aeneas told me you probably liked me way before a month before we got together, apparently you always asked if I was coming when you guys were playing pool 🥺
26.03.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun playing games with Marco!
26.03.23, 17:23 - Niki: Thanks you driving back now? Yeah now that you say it I can kinda remember ask Aeneas 😳
26.03.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, on the train now. Thankfully I have no neighbour now! 
You may or may not have a brick wall next to your name in Aeneas' contacts now... Sorry? I told him that you didn't realise me inviting you to bake cookies and then the hand thingy was me showing interest and he was... Uhm... Kinda impressed how oblivious you were 😂
26.03.23, 17:28 - Niki: Yeah it's okay I can live with that. It is deserved to be fair 😅
26.03.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I might have one next to my name as well, not sure though, would definitely also be deserved 😅
26.03.23, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did Aeneas send you any pictures?
26.03.23, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
26.03.23, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
26.03.23, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
26.03.23, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really missed you today. It was fun hanging out with Aeneas but I wish you were there too 😅
26.03.23, 22:07 - Niki: Yeah some
26.03.23, 22:07 - Niki: Would love to be there it looks awesome ☺️
26.03.23, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was your evening?
26.03.23, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: /is
26.03.23, 22:11 - Niki: Was alright Alex came back to the apparment and we talk abit about stuff he did at home. How is/was your evening?
26.03.23, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, he had a good time I hope?
26.03.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I called Alex, was quite nice. We're gonna sign up for an intro class pole dancing, believe it or not
26.03.23, 22:14 - Niki: Yeah he fine
26.03.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And then I was suddenly hit with a really strong feeling of missing you for... some reason?
26.03.23, 22:15 - Niki: Okay sounds interesting the only think I now about pole dancing is that it's really hard. Hope you have fun with Alex on that.
26.03.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, you gotta be really strong and flexible for it, but apparently they train you from the basics so I'm not too worried about it, just sounds really cool to be able to do it
26.03.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: goodnight 😅
26.03.23, 23:26 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
26.03.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *❤️
26.03.23, 23:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you (too much)
26.03.23, 23:30 - Niki: I love you but I think I miss you more 😘
26.03.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... sincerely doubt that but if you say so 😘
26.03.23, 23:32 - Niki: Well just lay in bed and can't stop thinking about you 🥰🥲
26.03.23, 23:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel like part of me isn't in the right place
26.03.23, 23:34 - Niki: Yeah I think so too.
26.03.23, 23:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Shit, this is gonna make me cry
26.03.23, 23:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fuck hormones and feelings and that teleportation is non-existant
26.03.23, 23:37 - Niki: I never agreed to somethink more
26.03.23, 23:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have to wake up early tomorrow?
26.03.23, 23:38 - Niki: Yeah sadly
26.03.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Less than 2 weeks
26.03.23, 23:41 - Niki: Yeah I see it everyday 🥰
26.03.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Me too, but tonight it's like it is taunting me with how long it still is 🥹 (it's not that long but it feels like it anyway)
26.03.23, 23:43 - Niki: Well yeah get that too sometimes but most of the time I am a like kid that's excited for Christmas 🥰
26.03.23, 23:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're too cute sometimes... 🥹❤️
26.03.23, 23:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm really looking forward to coming to Germany
26.03.23, 23:47 - Niki: I am too. I will see what you think off my area and friends/family
26.03.23, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm really curious to see everything and meet everyone :)
26.03.23, 23:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you and I miss you loads, so I'm gonna go to sleep now so I can skip 8 hours in the countdown to seeing you 😘
26.03.23, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
26.03.23, 23:53 - Niki: Good idea will do the same
26.03.23, 23:53 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
27.03.23, 09:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, what're you up to today?
27.03.23, 10:16 - Niki: Good morning nothing much to be honest just university. Oh yeah I got myself in to the university volleyball team so I gone play today at 15:00. What are your plans for today?
27.03.23, 10:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's nice! Do you also do competitions or is it just recreational? (I have no clue how university teams work) 
I have uni, then maybe law with Alex and then hip hop, nothing special
27.03.23, 10:20 - Niki: I think just recreational
27.03.23, 10:20 - Niki: Yeah you go later to uni right?
27.03.23, 10:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, going to uni around 12 to prepare for our meeting at 3 😅... I think we'll meditate together so we don't all burst out into rage 😊
27.03.23, 10:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: As long as you're having fun, that all that matters
27.03.23, 12:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Booked a room at my uni for group work... 😅
27.03.23, 12:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
27.03.23, 12:19 - Niki: Everybody sits in a corner of the room 😅
27.03.23, 12:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, I guess so, that's where the power outlets are 😂
27.03.23, 13:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is like a weekly support meeting rather than a group work meeting, fucking love it
27.03.23, 13:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day?
27.03.23, 13:25 - Niki: Doing great first lecture is over and now just working on some exercise
27.03.23, 14:42 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
27.03.23, 14:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yo what?? That's so cool, I mean, I think it's cool but it's probably kinda annoying too
27.03.23, 14:43 - Niki: Yeah it looks nice suck in person but it's okay
27.03.23, 14:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The closest we got to snow here today was hail :)
27.03.23, 14:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah fair, it probably does suck in person 😅
27.03.23, 14:45 - Niki: Well it's probably more like hail too
27.03.23, 14:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But snow... 😄☃️
27.03.23, 14:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My teammate just got a sign from god 😂
There is a boat that says "it's a great time to be in HR" when he's doing an HR internship :)
27.03.23, 14:47 - Niki: xD
27.03.23, 14:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
27.03.23, 14:53 - Niki: She looks nice hope she accepts your BAP Question
27.03.23, 14:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She looks nice?? She's the devil incarnate 😂🥲
27.03.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, you have volleyball in a couple of minutes right? Have fun!!!
27.03.23, 14:56 - Niki: Well yeah she is the devil. I hate her too
27.03.23, 14:56 - Niki: Yeah 15:45 miss read the Time but need to go soon
27.03.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was volleyball?
27.03.23, 18:08 - Niki: Was pretty nice didn't have the right shoes with me but Somebody lent me there's 😅
27.03.23, 18:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's nice of them! Glad you had a good time 😊
27.03.23, 21:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening?
27.03.23, 22:00 - Niki: Eat dinner with alex.  Now i need to work on some lectures. That i missed while i was at the Volleyball practice. How was your evening ?
27.03.23, 22:02 - Niki: How was the BAP Question by the way did she except you proposel now? Did you go with Alex to the law lecture? Sorry that I ask this only now today I was really busy 😓
27.03.23, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're still working? Damn, my evening was alright, just went to hip hop and that was basically it
27.03.23, 22:02 - Niki: Yeah Monday sucks this semester 🥲
27.03.23, 22:03 - Niki: Also kinda my own vault 😅
27.03.23, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The BAP question... Basically she agreed on our plan last week but somehow didn't tell us about that, we had a whole meeting about it, I said some passive aggressive things (but in a polite way so she probably didn't notice) and in the end nothing really changed but dear lord, thank god we can finally start our actual research
27.03.23, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, didn't go to law class with Alex, she couldn't go to class again, this time because she had to feed her brother... He's 18 but okay I guess 😅
27.03.23, 22:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't worry about it, I figured you'd be busy today 😘
27.03.23, 22:07 - Niki: Well nice for the BAP sucks that your group wasted a week because of her but nice in the end. I have no idea how Alex gone pass sif she is not going but well.
27.03.23, 22:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, and I spent some time studying German again today, I'm planning on getting to at least page 100 in the book before I come over 😊
27.03.23, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh... Alex already gave up on the idea of passing the law class sooo... 😅
27.03.23, 22:09 - Niki: Well Damm that's good goal mabye I will try the same with the Dutch book will see.
27.03.23, 22:10 - Niki: Is there a maximum of years you can study one topic in Belgium?
27.03.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't push yourself if you're too busy, but maybe we could make it a study date in that case? No clue if that would be fun or not but we could try it out maybe
27.03.23, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really, the only thing is that you have to pass all the courses of your first year within the first 2 years you study a certain degree
27.03.23, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although, looking at the escape room thingy, maybe it's not that great of an idea 😅
27.03.23, 22:12 - Niki: That's pretty chill well hope she can do it 🙏🏼
27.03.23, 22:13 - Niki: Yeah mabye. I would love to study in person with you though 😘
27.03.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We'll see I guess. All I know is that Alex doesn't have to worry this year... Jinte though 😅
27.03.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... Sure, but I think we both know simply reading books is much more fun
27.03.23, 22:15 - Niki: Ohh yeah right jinte also failed so classes. Damm your friends are nice but study wise they have not a great ethic. Well I can't talk I failed enough classes already but still
27.03.23, 22:15 - Niki: I love reading books with you 😘
27.03.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, all my friends are terrible procrastinators... (And I'm unfortunately the same... The difference is that I actually go to classes)
27.03.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you have anything planned tomorrow evening?
27.03.23, 22:26 - Niki: Marco want to play with me some lol but I can reschedule that. Wanna call?
27.03.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, if that's okay? But you don't have to reschedule something if you've already planned it 😅
27.03.23, 22:28 - Niki: Yeah no, no worrys he is understandable. Tell me a time when your ready and we can call.
27.03.23, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I have to cook tomorrow so 8 or something?
27.03.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (the fact that you'd reschedule something to call me is really sweet btw, it's made me kinda shy right now)
27.03.23, 22:38 - Niki: 8 sounds good. 
For you my love I would resedule  anything 🥰😘
27.03.23, 22:39 - Niki: *reschedule
27.03.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Niki... Why are you like this??? Boy, it's like you know exactly what to say to make me fall in love deeper every fucking time 😭❤️
27.03.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not melting, at this point I'm molten. Like lava, because my cheeks feel like they're on fire too
27.03.23, 22:43 - Niki: Well my cheeks hurt too because I can't stop grinning ☺️
27.03.23, 22:43 - Niki: Hope you can still get a good night of sleep 😘
27.03.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll just hope to meet you in my dreams, that'd be a perfect night for me (at least when I can't have you in my arms) 😘
27.03.23, 22:46 - Niki: Back too you
27.03.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gosh, I feel like one of those typical teenage girls from movies that talk to their crush laying on their bed, on their stomach with the feet in the air, you know what I mean?
27.03.23, 22:49 - Niki: I know I feel the same way and Damm i get way they do it. It's so cliché but still it feels right i don't know
27.03.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp... Now it all makes sense...
27.03.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know how either

28.03.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck at uni 😊
28.03.23, 10:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have been sent on a wild goose chase for blindfolds... 😅 This internship really isn't what I expected it to be
28.03.23, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was/is your day?
28.03.23, 17:54 - Niki: Was pretty nice went to university and play a game with Marco after that. How was your day? And what's up with the blindfold think from?

28.03.23, 21:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could you do me a small favour please? If you have time, could you do this quiz and send me your results? https://5lovelanguages.com/quizzes/love-language
28.03.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not urgent at all, just do it when you feel like it please?
28.03.23, 21:57 - Niki: Will do tomorrow
28.03.23, 22:48 - Niki: Done with the stuff going to sleep now
28.03.23, 22:48 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
28.03.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
29.03.23, 08:58 - Niki: Good morning my love. How did you sleep?
29.03.23, 09:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning :) I slept alright, how was your night?
29.03.23, 09:23 - Niki: Pretty nice. I was really confused by our 3 roommate just standing in the door way when I gone to the bath. I kown he would come today because of Electricity meter. That we could be there because of university but still. I was half a sleep and he just came in 😵‍💫
29.03.23, 09:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahaha, oh no, that must have been a surprise 😂
I was surprised by the exact opposite actually, the guys to renew our window had to be there at 8:30 but I got downstairs at 8:30 and no one was there?? Maybe they're not even coming today I don't know 😅
29.03.23, 09:25 - Niki: Well they seemed not that reliable
29.03.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... The only reason my parents trust them is because they've done work for friends of ours and because (quoting my dad) "I know where he lives" but they do seem pretty sketchy. Guess we'll see
29.03.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How many classes (and which) do you have today?
29.03.23, 10:35 - Niki: Love you dad's reasoning.
29.03.23, 11:14 - Niki: i got 2 classes todasy one is already over and the other one is at 14:00 until 15:30 but it will take longer propably
29.03.23, 11:15 - Niki: What are your Task for today at work? Start writing with the client you got now ?
29.03.23, 11:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh... He doesn't do shit despite it though, there's an artist guy that kinda stole his bike 3 years ago and he knows where he lives yet still hasn't done anything about it
29.03.23, 11:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope it doesn't take too much longer
29.03.23, 11:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was pushed into a meeting that I didn't know anything at all about it at 10, only just got out of there... Fuck that was stressful, I didn't even know the woman's name or anything 😅
29.03.23, 11:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also only found out I had to take meeting notes the moment she entered the building 😅
29.03.23, 11:33 - Niki: damm that sucks hope the day gets better after that
29.03.23, 11:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It wasn't that bad I guess, just really stressful to be put on the spot like that. No clue what I'm doing now though :) What are you up to while you wait for your next class?
29.03.23, 11:40 - Niki: Exercise of other courses and make lunch
29.03.23, 11:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you go home in between classes or what do you do?
29.03.23, 11:52 - Niki: The second course is online.
29.03.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh… Okay, I see!
29.03.23, 11:52 - Niki: But normal i would eat at the cafeteria in our university
29.03.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: With the sometimes shitty food?
29.03.23, 11:54 - Niki: Yeah but it's cheap 😅
29.03.23, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Valid, and if it's only sometimes shitty, worth it
29.03.23, 11:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question though, is it flavorwise or texturewise shitty? Or both?
29.03.23, 11:57 - Niki: Sometimes on or the other and sometimes both
29.03.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If it was just flavour... I would just say to bring some spices with you, texture is a bitch to deal with and both... Well... Yeah... Nothing much to do about it I'm afraid
29.03.23, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I just remembered. You know Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis? Apparently they're in Ghent now. My coworker is very excited
29.03.23, 12:27 - Niki: Okay crazy. They are filming or just vacation
29.03.23, 12:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think it's just vacation but I'm not sure
29.03.23, 12:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd say I'll ask them for a picture if I see them tonight but quite frankly I probably won't 😅
29.03.23, 12:31 - Niki: Yeah the chance are slime.
29.03.23, 12:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, also if they're on a holiday I'd hate to disturb their relaxation time anyway
29.03.23, 12:32 - Niki: So true. I would hate people for it to be frank
29.03.23, 12:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same... I mean, I guess you get used to it but I'd hate to be hounded by fans anytime I'd go out, never mind when I'm on vacation in a different country
29.03.23, 12:36 - Niki: https://5lovelanguages.com/quizzes/results/98cd8e09-687c-4ef3-b51f-0c9c54da038b
29.03.23, 12:37 - Niki: I don't know if you can see my results
29.03.23, 12:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I can
29.03.23, 12:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you 😘
29.03.23, 12:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
29.03.23, 12:38 - Niki: No worrys sometimes I need to chose the not that worst option
29.03.23, 12:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, same
29.03.23, 12:38 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
29.03.23, 12:39 - Niki: We have nearly the same result kinda nice
29.03.23, 12:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's nice, only thing that kinda sucks is that both of us have quality time as main language... In a long distance relationship 😅, fuck it, we'll figure it out
29.03.23, 12:42 - Niki: Well yeah Fuck around and find out. We will find a way no worries
29.03.23, 12:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fuck around and find out is becoming our motto, isn't it? 😂
29.03.23, 12:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I like it
29.03.23, 15:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So, your prof going overtime like you thought?
29.03.23, 15:32 - Niki: Yeah it's still going
29.03.23, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is it at least interesting?
29.03.23, 15:32 - Niki: Yeah kinda
29.03.23, 15:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still sucks, but it's kinda alright then I guess? How much overtime do you think he's gonna go?
29.03.23, 15:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They have me analysing cookies now, and how best to stalk our prospective customers when they go on our website I guess? It's actually pretty interesting, kinda like it :)
29.03.23, 15:43 - Niki: It's over now thank God 😅
29.03.23, 15:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 13 minutes... Could be worse! But yes, thank god it's over now :)
29.03.23, 15:44 - Niki: Yeah it's crazy and kinda scary how much they see from one visit to the website. But it's still interesting to see
29.03.23, 15:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is really freaky, also how long the information is kept is kinda crazy. And now I'm supposed to find a way to capture the utmost amount of information I can... Oh well. Think I might learn a few things along the road, I like this kind of work :)
29.03.23, 15:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm starting a glossary to write down all the words I don't understand though 😅😂
29.03.23, 15:47 - Niki: I would love to help you but I think your not allowed to sent the data to me.
29.03.23, 15:47 - Niki: I can help you with them if u want to
29.03.23, 15:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, yeah no, I signed an NDA so I'm afraid that's not an option, thanks though! 😘
29.03.23, 15:48 - Niki: Or you can ask chat gbt for that
29.03.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I run into anything I really can't understand I'll definitely let you know, so far it's dumb things though, only 2 things on the list that made sense after I looked them up. Boolean values and rage clicks (should have known what the second was honestly)
29.03.23, 15:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could do!
29.03.23, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I found something I can't figure out. I don't know what the fuck this thing means or what the hell it does. Please help me?
29.03.23, 17:01 - Niki: Yeah sure what is it ?
29.03.23, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: RFC 6960
29.03.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
29.03.23, 17:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you can't figure it out it either it's fine, I'm just massively confused about it but honestly it's just a small tidbit I'd like to know, not crucial to the work I'm supposed to be doing at all 😅
29.03.23, 17:06 - Niki: If i get it right its a protocol useful in determining the current
   status of a digital certificate without requiring certificate revocation lists
29.03.23, 17:06 - Niki: Its a protocol to check if somebody should have Access. i think 😅
29.03.23, 17:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohhh, I see! With everything else I've found out so far that might make Sense
29.03.23, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think my general knowledge of this kind of shit isn't good enough to understand even half of what I'm reading but hey, that's what learning is for :)
Thanks for helping me love, you're the best ❤️
29.03.23, 17:09 - Niki: i did do much but thanks and No worries i feel the same way most of the time i ready stuff like that too.
29.03.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've figured out what it is
29.03.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jesus Christ
29.03.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically there's a whole database of questions that were asked by developers of some kind (part of the Internet Engineering Task Force) and an RFC is a request for comments. After it then gets ratified, it becomes a standard. Basically when it said that it is described in RFC 6960 they literally meant that X.509 is described in the RFC 6960... The database is fucking huge
29.03.23, 17:17 - Niki: Okay nice kinda curious now?
29.03.23, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This database goes back to the ARPAnet days... In the 1970s 😅
29.03.23, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (Request For Comments) A document that describes the specifications for a recommended technology. Although the word "request" is in the title, if the specification is ratified, it becomes a standards document. Not all RFCs become standards; some are designated indefinitely with Informational or Experimental status.
29.03.23, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This might clarify the RFC thingy better than I can 😅
29.03.23, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to tonight?
29.03.23, 18:26 - Niki: Listing to classes and doing the exercise for that class
29.03.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hopefully something fun too?
29.03.23, 18:27 - Niki: Not really interesting but not all of it
29.03.23, 18:28 - Niki: Marco want to play with me some ges but I am not sure when I finish this shit 😅 but probably soon
29.03.23, 18:28 - Niki: *Ges = games
29.03.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hopefully! Don't spend too much time on school, have some fun too 😘
29.03.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I figured, but thanks for the clarification 😊
29.03.23, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I may or may not have won pink fluffy handcuffs when shooting bow and arrow
29.03.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I personally blame Jinte for being a terrible influence to my morality
29.03.23, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then again, I did great on the shooting
29.03.23, 22:22 - Niki: xD well nice. I also think jinte is a bad morality influence for you
29.03.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries, I'm a terrible influence on her too, I got her to spend €8 on the grabbing machines 😅
29.03.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She also almost got me to buy a MTG starters kit
29.03.23, 23:12 - Niki: Did she hook something?
29.03.23, 23:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nopeee, totally wasted money
29.03.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're in world's end now, with Jinte's friend Alex playing Cards against Muggles
29.03.23, 23:19 - Niki: Well it was a good time I guess
29.03.23, 23:19 - Niki: Everybody knows a Alex damm
29.03.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, everyone really does know an Alex
29.03.23, 23:20 - Niki: Cards against Muggles (Harry Potter Version of cards against humanity?
29.03.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes indeed
29.03.23, 23:22 - Niki: Nice have fun 😘
29.03.23, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I'm about to go home, gotta walk back to my bike and then cycle home without lights because I forgot them 😅
29.03.23, 23:22 - Niki: Ohh okay hope you get home save 😘 mabye use your phone in some way
29.03.23, 23:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'll figure something out, thanks for the idea 😘
29.03.23, 23:39 - Niki: Write me when your get home savely 😘
29.03.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got home, I'm going to sleep now 😘
29.03.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
30.03.23, 07:03 - Niki: I fell asleep while looking at the screen 😓
30.03.23, 07:04 - Niki: Sorry 😭
30.03.23, 08:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hoped that was the case 😅 I know you have a lot of classes today, I'd rather have you (kind of) rested than have you stay awake just to say goodnight 😘
30.03.23, 08:25 - Niki: But I wanted to see you text and know that you got home safely. I hate my sleep schedule now 😓
30.03.23, 08:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, it's alright, I got home safely didn't I?
30.03.23, 08:33 - Niki: Yeah you right 🥰.
30.03.23, 09:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with your classes 😘
30.03.23, 09:13 - Niki: Thanks hope your work is not that stressful today 😘
30.03.23, 10:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I got a new task... I can't fucking believe it but apparently our website does not have a cookie policy... 😅 Kinda illegal but okay, so I have to create one now 😊
30.03.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How are your classes going?
30.03.23, 14:18 - Niki: Class was nice
30.03.23, 14:19 - Niki: Your still on it and how exactly do you do a cookie policy. Kinda interesting
30.03.23, 14:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I'm gonna be a cookie specialist after this week 😅
Still figuring out how to set it up but the European Union has a really nice example kit for some reason
30.03.23, 14:23 - Niki: Nice yeah I have no idea what's inside the agreement. I just Klick accept most of the time. I know what cookies do but that's all
30.03.23, 14:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I usually click reject, just in case. Turns that that makes a huge difference in the amount of targeted ads you get 😅
30.03.23, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I decided to read the policy agreement of Foodpairing... It's majorly out of data, last revised in 2014 😅
30.03.23, 14:41 - Niki: Damm okay something shocking in there are or a esteregg?
30.03.23, 14:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, just bullshit 😅
I don't even want to know the fines a company can get for not enforcing proper GDPR 😅
30.03.23, 14:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have more classes today or you're done?
30.03.23, 14:46 - Niki: One was canceled so I am done just recap now
30.03.23, 14:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's pretty nice!
30.03.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm always so happy when the day is over, no matter if it was a good day or not
30.03.23, 17:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How're you doing? 😘
30.03.23, 17:41 - Niki: Doing good how was the rest of your workday?
30.03.23, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty alright, reading legislation gets boring though
30.03.23, 17:42 - Niki: Yeah get that I just procrastinat till now after the classes 😓
30.03.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tsss, that's not good 🙃
30.03.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would probably have done the exact same though
30.03.23, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just wondering, but do you still want to call today? I get it if you don't ❤️
30.03.23, 19:08 - Niki: I am not sure on one side I feel like shit for no reason at all and on the other side I wanna see you. I don't know
30.03.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm sorry you feel like shit. Maybe getting your mind of it could help? Or just going to sleep until tomorrow morning? I wish I could help ❤️
30.03.23, 19:18 - Niki: Probably going to sleep early yeah I don't know someday are like this 😓. But thanks for understanding ☺️
30.03.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course love, everyone has days like this. I hope you'll feel better when you wake up 😘❤️
30.03.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
30.03.23, 22:44 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
30.03.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wouldn't say being awake at 11 is going to sleep early but if it means you're feeling better then that's all that matters to me ❤️
30.03.23, 22:50 - Niki: Yeah kinda but I just couldn't sleep and stared at my phone screen swapping between Instagram and you tube. I don't know why but today was a shity day 🥲.
30.03.23, 22:51 - Niki: Thanks though having someone tell me it's alright help though
30.03.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still feeling that shitty?
30.03.23, 22:51 - Niki: Yeah but it's getting better I guess
30.03.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fucking hate it when that just happens out of no where...

30.03.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's progress!
30.03.23, 22:55 - Niki: Yeah I wish you were here. Would love to hug you right now so much ❤️.

30.03.23, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes please, take good care of yourself! Do some mental health exercises or something, definitely go for a walk! No matter how much I hate mental health walks, they fucking work 😅
30.03.23, 22:57 - Niki: Will do have a good night of sleep see you tomorrow at dnd 😘
30.03.23, 22:57 - Niki: Or Mabye befor dnd?

30.03.23, 23:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you, please take care of yourself, you're precious 🤗 and goodnight ❤️ (again)
30.03.23, 23:03 - Niki: Love you too and thanks  didn't hear that directly in a long time feels really great. 
Goodnight ❤️ (again)
31.03.23, 08:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning love, I hope you have a wonderful day 😘
You sleep alright?
31.03.23, 08:32 - Niki: Good morning yeah I slept alright. How about you? Hope you have a great day too
31.03.23, 08:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Slept great, had a really hard time getting up though 😅
31.03.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I'm working from home this afternoon... Should be an interesting experience 😅
31.03.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going? I hope better than yesterday ❤️
31.03.23, 12:54 - Niki: Yeah getting better. I think for dnd i will be back to normal 😅
31.03.23, 12:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm glad you're getting better. Did you go on your mental health walk or nah?
31.03.23, 12:59 - Niki: Yeah kinda walk with Alex to the supermarket but it's also raining a lot.
31.03.23, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, it's raining a lot here too... The fucking weather
31.03.23, 15:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How you doing love?
31.03.23, 15:46 - Niki: Doing better thanks for asking. How is your home office going?
31.03.23, 15:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm happy to hear (read) that!
31.03.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Home office is going splendidly, I kind of finished my work and Alex came by to get her helmet. We had some tea together. She's going back home now for dnd though
31.03.23, 15:58 - Niki: Sounds nice what you think about home office? Mabye the let you do it once a week or something like it?
31.03.23, 15:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, they're pretty flexible with it, pretty sure they would allow it as long as I don't have any meetings scheduled
31.03.23, 15:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I like working at the office better though, I get distracted way too easily at home 😅
31.03.23, 16:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can definitely work from home, I just really benefit from having other people that are working around me. Pretty sure just having someone on videocall or something would be enough too though.
31.03.23, 16:22 - Niki: Okay yeah I think I am the same i need someone that kinda watches over me. If you know what I mean?
But nice that they are so flexible.
31.03.23, 16:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I get it, just some motivation to actually keep doing the thing I need to do and not wander off and do something else. yeah, the company is pretty cool
31.03.23, 16:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... Did a thing xx
31.03.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no clue how to explain this but I think I accidentally got myself a job(ish) for Alex's dad by being overly critical on the way his business handles sales and marketing... 😅
31.03.23, 17:10 - Niki: Okay you gone do it or what exactly is the situation? Is he a okay boss?
31.03.23, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He's... Special, I might do it just for the fun of it honestly (and also because I'd get paid) probably wouldn't be a bad boss, but I don't really want that close contact to him because of the shit that's going on in Alex's family 😅
He actually offered me a job 2 years ago already for when I'd graduate my bachelor's but I didn't want to do it then and I still don't
31.03.23, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You still want to call before dnd or do you want to relax some more?
31.03.23, 17:40 - Niki: Call at 19:00 ?
31.03.23, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think that's when dnd starts love
31.03.23, 17:51 - Niki: Okay I would have come to late 😅. Wanna call at 18:00? I hope I make it but I think I can
31.03.23, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahaha, you thought it was at 20?? We can also call at 18:30 or 18:15 if that is easier for you :)
31.03.23, 17:59 - Niki: Yeah, 18:15 would be easier. I legit thought it was 20:00 I don't know why to be honest
31.03.23, 18:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, no problem!
31.03.23, 18:15 - Niki: I am ready
31.03.23, 21:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute, I love seeing you happy and smiling :)
31.03.23, 21:37 - Niki: Thanks love seeing you figure stuff out 🥰
31.03.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What did you think of the session? And are you still gonna make the lasagna now?
31.03.23, 22:18 - Niki: We decided not to make lasagne. We each just eat our separate stuff. I thought the session was really great but I am kinda tired at the Ende. Marco also want to talk to me at the Ende of the seesion so yeah gone talk to him now. Your thoughts on the session?
My luck in the beginning was down right awful 😅
31.03.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I loved the session too, it was a lot of fun! But yeah, after 3 hours I'm always tired 😅
Make sure you eat a proper meal! 
Yeah, I think both of us rolled awfully at the beginning, I was only getting good rolls towards the end too 😅
Hope you have a nice conversation with Marco 😊
31.03.23, 22:31 - Niki: Yeah hope you have a good night too and sleep well if you go to bed now? (dnd Was awesome 🤗
31.03.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think I'll go to sleep yet, probably gonna take a shower first (all alone, how sad am I?) Enjoy the rest of your evening/have a good night if you're going to sleep now 😘
31.03.23, 22:37 - Niki: Yeah not probably gone talk a while with Marco. Wish I could be there with you 😘
01.04.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
01.04.23, 00:32 - Niki: Goodnight 😘
01.04.23, 09:01 - Niki: Good morning my love 🥰. How did you sleep? What are your plans for today?
01.04.23, 09:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning love 😘 I slept really good, how about you?
I'm going to Cato's to help with some schoolwork and to hang out. What do you have planned for today?
01.04.23, 09:18 - Niki: Sleep alright. Going to my parents house to spend some time with them. In the afternoon I am also paining to do the character sheets with some of the dnd campaign members. Say hey to Cato from me. Hope you two have fun while doing the schoolwork ☺️
01.04.23, 09:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy the time with your parents and good luck with the dnd character sheets! If I find out what's up with the armpits I'll let you know 😂😘
01.04.23, 09:34 - Niki: Oh yeah right the modeling. Yeah tell me kinda interested in it.
01.04.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay so... The assignment is to create a Catalog or webshop with out of the ordinary things. It won't just be normal armpits, it will be with accesoires, personalized t-shirts and all that. Honestly it's pretty cool 😁
01.04.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Only thing I'm afraid of is it becoming a kind of Fretfinder for armpits 😅
01.04.23, 11:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *feetfinder
01.04.23, 11:52 - Niki: Sounds nice but it's all draw or do they take pictures with the Accessoires
01.04.23, 11:53 - Niki: Well I guess you will find out mabye someone gone send you a request for more 😅
01.04.23, 12:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... They're all pictures and I'm the test model, so we'll see how this turns out 😅
01.04.23, 12:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let's hope not 😅
01.04.23, 16:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the character sheets making going? (And the rest of your day?)
01.04.23, 16:22 - Niki: We decided to create the character sheets at 17:00. Rest of the day is going okay nothing note worthy just stuff I need to do. Shopping a little bit of cleaning
01.04.23, 16:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh okay, pretty chill then, hope the dnd preparation goes well!
01.04.23, 20:12 - Niki: Dnd went pretty nice. We did a very short one shot so they can get a feeling for it and get to know the rules. At the Ende they killed each other 😅
01.04.23, 20:13 - Niki: How was your day? Did you start with your cousin on the project?
01.04.23, 20:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like they completely understood the spirit of DnD 😂
Glad that worked out! So now there's 1 more that needs to get an introduction?
01.04.23, 20:17 - Niki: Yeah hope i can fdo it while we start the real campaign
01.04.23, 20:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty good, we basically had a photoshoot all afternoon 😅 very interesting pictures, I don't think I'm model material but Cato seems happy with the turnout!
01.04.23, 20:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you find a date for that already or will that be another struggle?
01.04.23, 20:18 - Niki: Another struggle 😓
01.04.23, 20:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... Good luck, I'm sure you'll find a date... At some point in the future 😅🍀
01.04.23, 20:19 - Niki: Sounds nice and I think you model material 😘. Kinda wanna see some of the pictures 🤭
01.04.23, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love 😘
I'll ask of Cato can send me some of the pictures but I'm not sure I look all that flattering... Most of the pictures were focused on my armpits you know? 😂
01.04.23, 20:21 - Niki: Ohh yeah kinda forgot that 😓 well mabye there are some not that much focus on you armpits
01.04.23, 20:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll ask Cato 😂
01.04.23, 20:22 - Niki: That sucks was hoping to get some pictures of you.
01.04.23, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm sorry 😅😘
01.04.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
01.04.23, 20:38 - Niki: Nice pants 😊
01.04.23, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, they're my mom's 😂
01.04.23, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're finally going home 😅 How's your evening going?
01.04.23, 23:09 - Niki: My night going great. But Damm that's late hope you get home fast and safety
01.04.23, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, we had dinner with them and then spent another 3 hours watching tv or something 😅... I'm so tired from the social interaction, but it was a fun day 😊
01.04.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going to sleep now I think
01.04.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
01.04.23, 23:21 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
01.04.23, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you
01.04.23, 23:23 - Niki: Love you too
02.04.23, 09:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning love, how's you sleep and what are you up to today? 😘
02.04.23, 09:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I dreamt about you last night, it was a really nice dream so I'm kinda sad I woke up 🙃
02.04.23, 09:46 - Niki: Nothing much some university stuff and relaxing. I will have dinner with my parents tonight. What are you plans for today?
02.04.23, 09:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Some uni stuff and then it's Barry's first birthday (my aunt's dog) so apparently he has a birthday party we're going to
02.04.23, 09:49 - Niki: Sounds nice. No idea how a dog birthday party goes but hope you have fun there.
02.04.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're going for a walk and then have a drink, nothing much but should be nice
02.04.23, 09:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's less than a week now... I'm happy 😊
02.04.23, 14:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The urge to take a picture and post it on Instagram with my uncle smoking "on accident" so his gf can see it... 😅
02.04.23, 14:26 - Niki: Think about the drama you gone be involved in. But I get it
02.04.23, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, definitely not doing it but damn... If you smoke, at least be honest about it to your partner?
02.04.23, 14:47 - Niki: Yeah thinks so too. I hate it but I am okay with other people doing it so yeah. Be honest with you parner in every way possible.
02.04.23, 15:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly 😘
02.04.23, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you have volleyball again tomorrow? Just out of curiosity
02.04.23, 17:37 - Niki: Yeah got volleyball and probably gone go out to eat with my parents. They couldn't do it today
02.04.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, that's too bad, I hope you can get dinner with them tomorrow then. So it's every week on Monday that you have training then?
02.04.23, 18:01 - Niki: Yeah every Monday
02.04.23, 18:01 - Niki: From 15:45-17:30
02.04.23, 18:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was wondering if we could call tonight? If you're not going out for dinner with your parents, otherwise we probably won't be able to call until Thursday or Friday 😅
02.04.23, 18:38 - Niki: Me and Alex probably still go out to eat though but yeah we can call. Mabye around 21:00 or something like that?
02.04.23, 18:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, that works for me, but don't rush, just let me know if you don't have time 😊 (and have fun with Alex)
02.04.23, 18:40 - Niki: Okay will tell you when I can
02.04.23, 19:22 - Niki: Alex doesn't feel well so we aren't not going to eat dinner together.
02.04.23, 19:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's too bad, I hope he feels better soon!
02.04.23, 19:26 - Niki: Yeah but I don't feel to bad about because now we can definitely call
02.04.23, 19:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is kind of true yeah 😅 One way to look at the positive side of things!
02.04.23, 20:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still wanna call at 21 then?
02.04.23, 20:16 - Niki: Yeah still need to make food 😅
02.04.23, 20:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course, just wanted to make sure 😊
02.04.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Call me when you're ready
02.04.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.04.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.04.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.04.23, 21:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now I'll actually get started on my report 😅🥲 xx
02.04.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm done with everything :) Going to sleep now too
02.04.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
02.04.23, 22:47 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
03.04.23, 08:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, how did you sleep? 😘
03.04.23, 08:49 - Niki: Good morning I slept good. How did you sleep and what are your plans for today?
03.04.23, 08:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, I had a hard time falling asleep. I'm in a meeting for BAP right now, think that's the only thing I will do today. Oh, and apparently they're working on the window again today, hopefully that means it will be done sooner :)What are you doing today?
03.04.23, 08:59 - Niki: The BAP meeting is online? Hopefully the window will be done sooner. My plan for today is just university volleyball and dinner with my parents nothing special but it's a lot for one day 😅
03.04.23, 09:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, because our coach told us uni is closed today because of the Easter holidays (turns out that isn't true but anyway) I think we'll stop the meeting after Robin passes by.
Yeah, your day sounds really busy 😅 I hope you get through it alright and that you don't fall asleep at the dinner table 😘
03.04.23, 10:26 - Niki: My grandma just called me we are invite for Cafe and dinner at her place on Sunday around 15:30 for Café.
03.04.23, 10:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, sounds good :)
03.04.23, 11:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When do you have classes next week? I might need to do some interviews so I want to know when I can plan them
03.04.23, 11:51 - Niki: Wednesday's morning.
Thursday the whole day.
Friday morning.
03.04.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, thank you! ❤️
03.04.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was your day so far?
03.04.23, 18:22 - Niki: Pretty nice exepte i procrastinat my university stuff from today till now 😅. But volleyball was relaxing and my mom canceled today's dinner again still feeling sick😓
03.04.23, 18:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no... I hope she's feeling better soon! A lot of people seem to be falling ill lately... 🥲
Well then, better get started on the uni stuff I guess? Glad you had a good time at volleyball 😊
03.04.23, 20:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have a question, but I don't want you to think it means anything else than it just being a question, I'm genuinely just curious. I've noticed that you often say you're tired when you end a call, and that you're going to sleep then, but then an hour later you're still awake. You know you could just tell me you don't feel like talking anymore right? I won't take offence to it or anything
03.04.23, 20:10 - Niki: Sorry if it seems that way. Most of the time I am tried but I can't sleep. Like I need at least 30min in bed to fall asleep. I also don't want too bore you(i know I probably don't but I don't know my thoughts go the other way) . I also thought about falling a sleep at the phone seems kinda weird to me and I don't know if I like it.
03.04.23, 20:12 - Niki: And no worrys you can ask me anything I won't be mad or angry any other negative reaction to it
03.04.23, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You don't have to be sorry about that, I was just wondering, I figured it might be something like you having a hard time to fall asleep, but I just thought I'd ask to be sure 😊
You also never bore me, we could literally both be calling and doing schoolwork and I'd still appreciate the time spent together you know? And yeah, we tried the falling asleep on the phone thingy and I think we can say that didn't work out too well, not the biggest fan of it myself 😅
03.04.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can also always ask me anything, I promise I won't get annoyed or mad at anything you want to know ❤️
03.04.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out Robin is much younger than all of thought 😅 apparently the guy is 26 or 27?? Now it makes sense how he gets along so well with the BAP group
03.04.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found this out through a big time rush reference 😅😂
03.04.23, 21:28 - Niki: Damm he got a doctor Titel? Big time rush reference 😂😂 never thought that would be a usefull/interesting think 😅
03.04.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, he doesn't have a doctorate, imagine that... he started working at my uni at 24 😅 yeah, turns out big time rush made a difference after all 😂
Also the fact that everyone was positively surprised and impressed when I told them they're back together on tour 😂
03.04.23, 21:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also broke into my neighbours house today (with their consent)
03.04.23, 21:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was surprisingly easy
03.04.23, 21:34 - Niki: Wait... What why and how? But nice that you got it done
03.04.23, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She got locked out, so I climbed over the wall. Pretty high, I think more than 3m? But the backdoor was open so once I got over I could just open the front door for her 😊
03.04.23, 21:36 - Niki: Damm nice good job.
03.04.23, 21:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfftt, thanks 😂
03.04.23, 21:38 - Niki: Nah I don't know a lot of people who would do that for there neighbor.
03.04.23, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why not? I once helped them fix their garage door, it's just being a nice neighbour? Idk, it just makes sense to me?
03.04.23, 21:42 - Niki: I don't know exactly why. But i thinks because most people that I know are not so close with there neighbours. I mean I don't even know there names here and where my parents life it's the same (for me)
03.04.23, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, in Belgium you often don't really know your neighbours either, god knows I barely know their names 😅 it's not like we see each other more than just the occasional time where we coincidentally are outside our houses at the same time. 
I would do the same thing for any neighbour that I've seen around for a while and just seems like a nice person I guess?
03.04.23, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite frankly I was really excited about climbing the wall so yeah, would have done it for any good reason 😂
03.04.23, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How are you spending your evening?
03.04.23, 21:47 - Niki: Get that would feel the same way
03.04.23, 21:48 - Niki: University stuff or procrastinat
03.04.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... The good stuff... Procrastinating...
03.04.23, 21:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What exactly do you have to do?
03.04.23, 21:51 - Niki: I need to write a "lastenheft". It's like a Softwareprojekt blueprint but more professional
03.04.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds not that interesting, but how would I know?
03.04.23, 21:55 - Niki: It's not that interesting. To be quit honest it sucks. I have zero motivation to do it
03.04.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would you be more motivated if you had someone watch you work on it?
03.04.23, 21:57 - Niki: I don't think so sorry
03.04.23, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no, I was just thinking if any of your roommates were also working you could sit together, idk
03.04.23, 21:59 - Niki: Nah they are playing the last of us two or monopoly right now together. They also ask me if I want to play with them but I need to finish this shit at some point
03.04.23, 21:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... that's too bad. If you actually worked on it consistently, how long do you think it would take you?
03.04.23, 22:00 - Niki: I am not sure but probably like 1h up too 2,5h something like that
03.04.23, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And by when does it need to be finished?
03.04.23, 22:02 - Niki: Well it was scheduled last week but he collects them in propably 2 weeks with a bunch of other stuff
03.04.23, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: … Now that is some next level procrastination 😅
03.04.23, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On both the teacher's and your part 😂
03.04.23, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So ideally it should be done tonight then?
03.04.23, 22:05 - Niki: Yeah we procrastinat together kinda 🥲. Yeah hopefully don't wanna waste another day with that shit
03.04.23, 22:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, then how about this... Let me know when you're finished. If you're done tonight before 12:30am ill reward you with... something (still have to think of something) would that be motivating?
03.04.23, 22:09 - Niki: Yeah but honestly not as much as you probably think. I am really lazy if I don't wanna do something but we can try sorry 😅.
03.04.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The problem is that I completely understand you 😂 It would slightly motivate me but then if I don't have a hard deadline and it's a shitty task I'd do it in class even if I really have to 😅
03.04.23, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you can make at least some progress tonight, if not finish it. Good luck 🙏🍀
03.04.23, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
03.04.23, 23:32 - Niki: I don't think I will get it done. But I am close to finish it now. Alex and Killian are now talking so I don't think I can finish it now
03.04.23, 23:33 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
03.04.23, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least you made some progress! That's already a start!
04.04.23, 00:52 - Niki: I wanna sleep 🥲
04.04.23, 00:52 - Niki: There not leaving
04.04.23, 08:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd kick them out for you but unfortunately that's not an option 😅
Still hope you slept well and enough 😘
04.04.23, 08:44 - Niki: Yeah slept good, how was your night?
04.04.23, 08:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty good, dreamt about you again 😅
04.04.23, 09:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The dreaming is nice, the waking up fucking sucks though 😅
04.04.23, 09:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We got the pictures from the photographer 2 weeks ago 😅 I don't know if I like them 😅
04.04.23, 09:41 - Niki: Okay how do they look?
I thought the conversations were carrying the photo shoot. Very natural and stuff like that
04.04.23, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They are like that, I'm just being insecure for some fucking reason, they're really not bad at all
04.04.23, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll get over it, no worries
04.04.23, 09:43 - Niki: No worrys you look beautiful no matter what your insecurities say 😘
04.04.23, 09:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're sweet 😘
04.04.23, 09:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

04.04.23, 09:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: These are the pictures if you wanted them 😅
04.04.23, 09:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I think it's entirely unfair I've sent you this amount of pictures and I got only 1 of you, so please if you have any they're always welcome 😘
04.04.23, 10:02 - Niki: Will send you some if I ever take some or somebody takes them of me😘
04.04.23, 10:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, I would love that <3
04.04.23, 12:27 - Niki: How is your work day going? On what are you working right now?
04.04.23, 12:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's really chill, barely anyone is at the office ^^'I'm preparing to discuss the cookie thing with my senior after lunch now, don't know what I'll do after that yet. How's your day going? What are you up to?
04.04.23, 12:35 - Niki: How much have you done on the cookie think? Hope she can help/ give you some useful advice. I am at university right now and working on some university stuff between my courses. They change the schedule so I have 4 hours between them 🥲
04.04.23, 12:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Your uni seems to change schedules so often? Why? Hope you get something useful done in the time you have now though.
I've done a whole research on it but all I've really found out is that we're definitely not doing very good on the whole GDPR guidelines 😅
04.04.23, 12:44 - Niki: Yeah I don't know why they change it but only like every 2 weeks to the 4 hour break between the courses. Nice hopefully the will value you saving there ass from a GDPR guideline lawsuit
04.04.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So weird... they can't stick to a normal schedule...

The IT guys seem to appreciate it, we'll see if sales and marketing do too, because god knows it's more convenient to be ignorant 😅
04.04.23, 13:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just found out ChatGPT is being blocked in Italy... And they're threatening to also block it in Germany
04.04.23, 13:38 - Niki: Yeah because of data safety and security reasons but we will see.
04.04.23, 13:38 - Niki: Else I need to use a VPN for it or a proxy
04.04.23, 13:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda makes sense, it learns from data input, but there's no real control as to what data is put in, especially the age concerns make a lot of sense too. Yeah, VPN solves all issues 😂
04.04.23, 13:41 - Niki: Yeah kinda like the way they solve it. But also on some points it's useless well we shall see. You ate lunch already ?
04.04.23, 13:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, I'm curious how other countries will react to it, my best guess is that they'll follow Germany with the final decision. Yeah, I ate lunch about an hour ago. You?
04.04.23, 13:53 - Niki: Yeah same cafeteria still sucks though 😅
04.04.23, 13:53 - Niki: What did you have for lunch?
04.04.23, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, I feel for you :(I had some pasta with mushrooms, leftovers from last night. What did you get?
04.04.23, 14:05 - Niki: I got some pasta with a cheesecream but it didn't taste that good
04.04.23, 14:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's really too bad, it isn't that hard to make a decent pasta?
04.04.23, 14:27 - Niki: It should be but well what can I do it's so cheap 😅
04.04.23, 14:27 - Niki: It shouldn't
04.04.23, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah okay, fair enough 😅
04.04.23, 15:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I got a new assignment, but first I have the absolute pleasure of telling everyone the illegal shit we're doing :) 
How's your classes going? At least I hope they're started again
04.04.23, 15:22 - Niki: Still 20 more min till they start but yeah. Savor the pleasure of telling it to them
04.04.23, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, it is great, I think I kind of panicked everyone when telling it, however they seemed pretty damn happy I somehow noticed it 😁
Your class starts at 15:45? Such a random hour 😅
04.04.23, 15:42 - Niki: Nice get the some awareness for the topic. Yeah well I don't know how they plane it.
04.04.23, 15:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, it's bloody great. I now get to send an email to the CEO about it :))) 
Good luck in class, hope you learn a lot 😘
04.04.23, 16:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just realised uni here also starts at a quarter to an hour usually (not my uni) but that's because it literally takes 15 minutes for all students to leave the aula and for the new students to enter 😅
04.04.23, 16:57 - Niki: Yeah kinda but most of the profs don't have that so yeah only the students
04.04.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... Still weird hours then
04.04.23, 16:58 - Niki: Yeah
04.04.23, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You normally don't text me during class... Boring class?
04.04.23, 16:59 - Niki: No classes is already over
04.04.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wait what... It was only an hour? That's pretty nice
04.04.23, 17:01 - Niki: Yeah but also useless that I stay there
04.04.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is... very true unfortunately... You thought it was gonna be a longer class?
04.04.23, 17:08 - Niki: Yeah and I thought we would do more it was really short
04.04.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That really sucks
04.04.23, 18:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No matter how funny today was, I am so happy to be home 😅 
Whatcha up to?
04.04.23, 18:12 - Niki: The others wanna go to Ikea and shopping but there is no real time schedule so I am relaxing and waiting for them 🥲
04.04.23, 18:13 - Niki: But nice that your day was so productive.
04.04.23, 18:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ikea is always fun, any clue what they want to buy or is it to just hang out?
04.04.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, was pretty productive, also turns out we're doing sales from now on. Goodbye marketing!
04.04.23, 18:17 - Niki: Happy with that decision or what you think about sales?
04.04.23, 18:17 - Niki: No idea
04.04.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty happy, but mainly because I was kinda done with marketing and now I get to work more closely with Michelle, the sales executive 😊
04.04.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... Ikea is big enough to do both I guess? But they better get going quickly, doesn't that thing close at 8 or something?
04.04.23, 18:20 - Niki: Yeah I think Ikea is off the table
04.04.23, 18:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How come? Limit of time?
04.04.23, 18:24 - Niki: Yeah I have no idea
04.04.23, 20:47 - Niki: Hope you have fun on the pole dancing class 😊
04.04.23, 20:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just finished, it was really fun but damn, definitely not for me 😂
04.04.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I constantly slipped off the pole because my hands were too sweaty 😅
04.04.23, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening? End up going to IKEA or no?
04.04.23, 20:58 - Niki: No Ikea we went shopping only for groceries
04.04.23, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Shopping is shopping I guess? 😅
04.04.23, 20:59 - Niki: Yeah I have no idea how it should work. But atleast you had fun. How did Alex do?
04.04.23, 21:00 - Niki: Yeah even though I would have liked to go to Ikea 😅
04.04.23, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, no clue how it works either 😂 Alex did really well actually, a fucking natural! I was so proud!
04.04.23, 21:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe tomorrow? Why do you want go? The cinnamon buns?
04.04.23, 21:04 - Niki: Nice for her. You still gone try it for her a bit more
04.04.23, 21:06 - Niki: Nah need some stuff for my room but would probably grab some of the cinnamon buns though
04.04.23, 21:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, next week she's gonna try it again with another friend, but we're gonna try kick boxing and Krav Maga together at some point 😊
04.04.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, what things do you need?
04.04.23, 21:09 - Niki: Bin and We need a bin for the bathroom
04.04.23, 21:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough, that's kinda important yeah
04.04.23, 22:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Finally got home ... My dad is very chatty with his friends
04.04.23, 22:41 - Niki: Just going to sleep now or what you doing?
04.04.23, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I'm gonna go upstairs but not gonna go to sleep yet I think, my parents are watching a dating show and I literally can't even look at it 😅
04.04.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you doing?
04.04.23, 22:44 - Niki: Playing with Marco and Elias some games
04.04.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, have fun 😊
04.04.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, fun update on Jinte's lovelife... 😂
Someone put a hand written card under the windshield wipers of her car to tell her she's beautiful, had a phone number and everything... And because she is Jinte or something she actually sent a message to the number... So guess we'll see how that turns out
04.04.23, 23:22 - Niki: Damm jinte is popular.
04.04.23, 23:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, and not only with guys 😂
04.04.23, 23:24 - Niki: Wait she also got some girl who are interested in her damm
04.04.23, 23:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not right now, but a couple of months back there was a girl at a party that wanted to kiss her so yeah 😂
04.04.23, 23:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also who knows, could be that the mystery writer is a woman, never specified that on that card 😅
04.04.23, 23:26 - Niki: The jinte i got to know is not the person I would expect to have a lot of love interest. Yeah could be. The writing on the letter mabye indicates who wrote it
04.04.23, 23:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honestly wouldn't have expected it either, but I guess both of us were wrong? I think for me it's mainly because she's been my best friend for 9 years so it's pretty damn impossible for me to imagine her as attractive to anyone 😅 she's my favourite gremlin, that's about it 😂
The writing to me looks male but I've been wrong before
04.04.23, 23:29 - Niki: We shall see I guess or not
04.04.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess so indeed
04.04.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I'm gonna go to sleep, hope I don't wake up with bruises all over my legs from the pole dancing 😅
04.04.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
04.04.23, 23:31 - Niki: Goodnight see you in my dreams ❤️
04.04.23, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope so ❤️
05.04.23, 08:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning how was your night? 😘
05.04.23, 08:51 - Niki: Pretty nice exepte that I didn't dream about you 🥲. How was you night?
05.04.23, 09:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My night was pretty shit actually 😅... Woke up like 20 times. But! I did dream about you, so that was nice. Also dreamt about us being robbed though so 😅
05.04.23, 09:08 - Niki: Well that sucks hope you have enough energy to get through your day 😘. Hope us getting robbed is not a future think that will happen.
05.04.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, don't think so, at least certainly don't hope so! I also hope I'll have enough energy, guess we'll see! What are you up to today? 😘
05.04.23, 09:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and I also woke up to my legs full of bruises 😅 but it's not that bad
05.04.23, 09:17 - Niki: Alex wants to go somewhere with a few. Of our friends and mabye Ikea we will see and university classes to
05.04.23, 09:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope this time plans do go through, unlike the ikea thing yesterday! Have fun! And good luck in your classes <3
05.04.23, 09:19 - Niki: Your gone start sales today? Hope the bruises are not that painfully when you sit down. Any thing else planed today?
05.04.23, 09:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, first task is pretty similar to marketing though, I have to look into data integration tools for the CRM software we're using. Hope I find something useful. Nah, the bruises aren't that bad. Cato is coming over tonight to photograph my parents and my aunt & Pieter, nothing else planned I think. Oh, yeah, I told Aeneas we'd call him once I'm in Germany because I couldn't last week and this week, I hope that's fine?
05.04.23, 09:22 - Niki: Yeah it fine no worries.
05.04.23, 09:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, nice 😊
05.04.23, 10:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna be dead before the end of today 🙃
05.04.23, 10:49 - Niki: So much to do?
05.04.23, 10:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not even, I'm just dead already, can't focus on anything and it's been not even 2 hours ^^'
05.04.23, 10:51 - Niki: Mabye some good tea can help. Or go home in your lunch break and sleep for abit.
05.04.23, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I was thinking about working from home, but unfortunately I have a meeting later today so I can't. I'll have a honey waffle probably :)
05.04.23, 10:53 - Niki: Well yeah sucks to have the meeting today
05.04.23, 10:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's not that important though so I'll be fine. How's your day going so far?
05.04.23, 10:55 - Niki: Pretty relaxing just doing university stuff
05.04.23, 10:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds pretty chill :)
05.04.23, 11:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Remember the guy that wrote Jinte a card? Turns out he's 24 :)
And probably a pervert according to his Facebook :)
Jinte attracts weird people :)
She also definitely not stalking him right now... Nooo 😅
05.04.23, 11:24 - Niki: Damm yeah she attracts weird people. Except you and mabye Lars
05.04.23, 11:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... At least we're not creeps I guess? ^^' But yeah... Also love how she found out his whole family and all that based on his first name and job title :) She's fucking creepy herself
05.04.23, 11:26 - Niki: She's fucking creepy herself 😂. I mean yeah kinda 😅
05.04.23, 11:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A+ stalker for sure
05.04.23, 11:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... it gets worse, she just found where he lives... I... 😭 How the fuck even???  And why??
05.04.23, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found out how she found out... Apparently his bedroom window looks out onto hers... 🙃
05.04.23, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... The fucking... I am so concerned right now
05.04.23, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
05.04.23, 12:26 - Niki: Okay yeah I think that's some stalker vibes right there
05.04.23, 12:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This fucking insane child thinks it's funny
05.04.23, 12:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I fucking can't
05.04.23, 12:26 - Niki: "hilarious" not it's creepy
05.04.23, 12:27 - Niki: Yeah she is insane
05.04.23, 12:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 100% certified insane
05.04.23, 12:28 - Niki: She should be at least a little bit creepy out right?
05.04.23, 12:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think she is but doesn't want to admit it because he's literally... right there. If she gets scared now she's not gonna leave her house again or open the curtains of her room, ya know?
05.04.23, 12:31 - Niki: Okay get that. But she needs to confront him right? Should do it with somebody but still you need to talk to them?
05.04.23, 12:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know what she's planning to do right now, I think she's probably gonna try to creep the shit out of him so he leaves her alone but maybe not... I'm not sure. Also don't really think confronting him is a great idea because he knows where she lives? Could retaliate easily
05.04.23, 12:46 - Niki: Yeah could be bad to confront him. But creeping him out might go also lead to a bad situation
05.04.23, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... Kinda a tough situation 😅
05.04.23, 15:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
05.04.23, 15:57 - Niki: Pretty nice. We are planning the night now because everybody got something they wanna do.
05.04.23, 15:58 - Niki: What are you up to? How was the rest of your day?
05.04.23, 16:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, I hope you can all agree on what to do tonight :) I just switched assignments with Gerardo because we were both kinda done with what we were working on (mentally) so I'm working on venture capitalist banks now :))
05.04.23, 16:47 - Niki: Yeah we decide on a first  semester party from another uni
05.04.23, 16:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice! Hope you have fun 😘
05.04.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also (I know I don't have to say this but anyway) be safe ❤️
05.04.23, 17:21 - Niki: Thanks yeah we will see planing it was kinda a hard because nobody cares what we do as always 😅
05.04.23, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like it's always a fun time when you're planning things ^^'
05.04.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't believe I'll be there in 3 days
05.04.23, 21:31 - Niki: Same but I love thing about it
05.04.23, 21:32 - Niki: Also there are same plan changes. We will go to my parents house on Saturday and meet my grandparents too
05.04.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohhhkay, thanks for letting me know 😊😅
You will have to speedrun telling me about your family for me when I arrive then 😅
05.04.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do I bring a present for everyone? Wait, do you guys do something for Easter?
05.04.23, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind, tell me about it later, you're probably doing something, is the party already happening or is that later today?
05.04.23, 21:39 - Niki: No don't need to worry no gifts
05.04.23, 21:40 - Niki: Going to the party now went to another meet up befor
05.04.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun! 😘
05.04.23, 22:28 - Niki: Thanks hope so too
05.04.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You go have fun, I'm gonna go to sleep now 😂
05.04.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
05.04.23, 22:29 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
06.04.23, 09:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, how was your night?
06.04.23, 09:59 - Niki: Good morning 😘. Party was okay we were there until 2 and then home for 40min kinda sucked but it was okay.
06.04.23, 10:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oof, I was so happy I was in my bed by 10:30, nevermind staying out at a party until 2 😅... Hope you at least got some sleep 😘
06.04.23, 12:48 - Niki: Yeah I woke up around 9 and made breakfast and went back to sleep until now 😄
06.04.23, 12:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, at least you didn't wake up at 7? Didn't you have classes today though?
06.04.23, 12:59 - Niki: Yeah we don't have classes today or tomorrow. Only released it yesterday thought.
06.04.23, 13:00 - Niki: Alex told me around 11 while we were at the party 😅
06.04.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's really nice! How come they were cancelled? For Easter or anything?
06.04.23, 13:05 - Niki: Yeah Easter probably
06.04.23, 13:31 - Niki: And we going to Ikea now 😄
06.04.23, 13:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, better late than never? 😂
06.04.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I asked around for multicultural advice and the general consensus (not counting Gerardo) is that I should definitely bring a present when meeting your parents so if you have any suggestions they're more than welcome 😅
06.04.23, 13:34 - Niki: No idea to be honest 😅
06.04.23, 13:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I bring some really special pralines and something else (trying to figure that out) I think it should be fine
06.04.23, 13:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I remember you said your mom does like pralines, and the once I'm thinking of are with regional fillings
06.04.23, 13:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For your dad... I will see
06.04.23, 15:44 - Niki: Yeah Sounds good I have no idea what my dad would like thought
06.04.23, 15:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I shall try to find something :) How's IKEA?
06.04.23, 15:52 - Niki: We are done bought some stuff mostly for us all
06.04.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice :)
06.04.23, 16:08 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
06.04.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have absolutely no clue what I'm looking at 😂
06.04.23, 16:09 - Niki: We bought a "whiteboard" with chalk and bin for the bathroom
06.04.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohhh, nice!
06.04.23, 16:09 - Niki: But I think we need two more
06.04.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 2 more bins or whiteboards?
06.04.23, 16:11 - Niki: Whiteboards
06.04.23, 16:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's the plan with them maybe? just for decoration or for other purposes?
06.04.23, 16:13 - Niki: For drawing stupid stuff. And mabye because we need to see how the one looks on the wall as a group
06.04.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, okay, I was thinking maybe for grocery lists or something, stupid stuff is more fun though :)
06.04.23, 16:22 - Niki: yeah grocery list is a good idea thanks 😘
06.04.23, 16:23 - Niki: How is your day going btw? Working on your task from yesterday or on the task of Gerardo?
06.04.23, 16:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Neither, I'm now making infographics and looking for some way to nicely and automatically visualise a google sheets with info from a Google form... And it has to be for free
06.04.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably not that hard honestly, could do it manually but it's just annoying
06.04.23, 16:43 - Niki: No always Automate it even if it takes only a few sec manually. Its great
06.04.23, 16:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I know, definitely always automate it, just gotta find a way how to. Which is a funny assignment when you think about it, more than half the company exists out of people that program all day... What do you mean I have to find a way to automate it? Then again, it's a learning opportunity for me too, I'm not complaining
06.04.23, 16:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: + everyone else definitely has way more important things to do than look for this 😂
06.04.23, 16:46 - Niki: You got a starting point? Or how is it going ?
06.04.23, 16:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I only just got the assignment so I literally just started looking, haven't found anything useful so far but I remember using a similar thing a  couple of years ago, might have to send a message about it to someone from my high school
06.04.23, 16:49 - Niki: Hope the highschool friend still knows about it. Else maybe chatgbt has a idea how to start or i can look for a starting point
06.04.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh... Wouldn't call him a friend. Remember the guy with the elitist poem? That's him 😅 
Should be fun to send him a message 😅
06.04.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, ChatGPT is a good idea, I'll look at it!
06.04.23, 16:52 - Niki: Oh Yeah i wouldn't write with him 😅. i would still hate him
06.04.23, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Too late, sent the message, it's really awkward and he probably won't remember anyway but... Yeah, it's done 😅
06.04.23, 16:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna check CGPT now, thanks for the idea 😘
06.04.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ChatGPT might have given me the solution already
06.04.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm impressed
06.04.23, 17:02 - Niki: Nice now you pretend like you work for the next 3 days and then present it to your junior 😅. Nah i am joking but nice that you found something 😁
06.04.23, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahha, I couldn't possibly do that! Apparently though, the previous intern used to be done with an assignment and not let anyone know so she could watch Netflix 😅 
So the bar is very low 😅
06.04.23, 17:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
06.04.23, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Our new window 😅
06.04.23, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There is more window than you can see, the wall close to the ceiling is just still in front of it, we still have to get rid of that... Without breaking the window... Somehow?
06.04.23, 17:06 - Niki: Nice the cat door will be in the window?
06.04.23, 17:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope
06.04.23, 17:07 - Niki: Ah okay, so it will go up close to the ceiling?
06.04.23, 17:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, pretty much fully to the ceiling
06.04.23, 17:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The cat door will go upstairs in the room where we have the washing machine
06.04.23, 17:09 - Niki: Nice think it will look really good with a nice look to the garden
06.04.23, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I think it will too!
06.04.23, 17:10 - Niki: oh yeah right hop Mustach will get use to it fast
06.04.23, 17:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... I fear for it, I think he will be in front of the door to the garden a lot. he'll demand we let him in because he's lazy
06.04.23, 17:11 - Niki: xD
06.04.23, 17:11 - Niki: I love his lazy attitude sometimes 😂
06.04.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, it is fabulous, yesterday he was so lazy he wasn't even running away from my aunt's dog, he just accepted it ^^
06.04.23, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So the guy just responded... He's very nice now, still not up for small talk but I very much appreciate that as I also don't want to talk to him. But he sent me the thing we used! Don't think I can use it now but who knows
06.04.23, 17:23 - Niki: Nice, what did you use back then? Will he also be there at the Reunion?
06.04.23, 17:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently it was advanced summary by awesome table, to immediately go from forms to graphs. No clue if he'll be there but I think it's likely
06.04.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
06.04.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The fact that this is available
06.04.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out I am not done... Because it would mean another website to use, which is too much, so I have to look for a tool that works within either Google forms or sheets
06.04.23, 17:44 - Niki: Well, a more specific search is nice. Pretty sure you will find something rather quickly.
06.04.23, 17:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I still have to try it out, but I think the one Jelle sent me will work out
06.04.23, 17:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to in the meantime?
06.04.23, 17:46 - Niki: Nothing much Elias is coding and I trying to help him.
06.04.23, 17:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's he trying to do?
06.04.23, 17:50 - Niki: You know the game shell shock live? He coded a aimbot for it. Now the update some stuff for it and it doesn't work anymore so he is debugging the game and looking for the reason. If you would like to know more let me know it will take a while too explain it.
06.04.23, 17:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I had to look it up but I've seen it before. I'd like to know more but maybe not now 😅 my brain is half fried 😅
06.04.23, 17:52 - Niki: yeah i am also asking so stuff because he is going very deep to find the problem
06.04.23, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope he finds it!
06.04.23, 17:54 - Niki: Yeah, no worries he gets kinda obsessed with this stuff until he finds it. He is the best programmer I know so he will get it done. He is kinda like jinte.
06.04.23, 17:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohhh, I see, in that case I have full faith in his capabilities! :)
06.04.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://forms.gle/oQcyjez3UnVzJxvi9
06.04.23, 17:58 - Niki: cant use it
06.04.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could you do me a favour and fill in some bogus answers please? I'm trying to figure something out 😅
06.04.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Huh
06.04.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Interesting
06.04.23, 17:58 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
06.04.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay what the fuck even
06.04.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh okay
06.04.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should work now
06.04.23, 17:59 - Niki: same link ?
06.04.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://forms.gle/m5Nt75Zonx7vdskF9
06.04.23, 18:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, I think this one should work
06.04.23, 18:01 - Niki: sendit
06.04.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
06.04.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You are fucking cute
06.04.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also goddamn
06.04.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm blushing on the middle of my workplace
06.04.23, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sir, how dare you? 😘
06.04.23, 18:02 - Niki: I know hitting on people while they work. I am disappointed in myself 🤭
06.04.23, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, very disappointed I'm sure
06.04.23, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And thank you very much
06.04.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks to this I can finish work for today 😊
06.04.23, 18:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You still want to call later?
06.04.23, 18:07 - Niki: Yeah you still want to?
06.04.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course!
06.04.23, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just not entirely sure when, I think they'll be gone by 19:30. Not sure when you want to call?
06.04.23, 18:10 - Niki: When ever you have the time for it 😘
06.04.23, 18:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I'll call you when they have left then?
06.04.23, 18:12 - Niki: Okay 👍🏻
06.04.23, 19:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We still have to eat something so will be closer to 19:45 or 8 I think
06.04.23, 19:17 - Niki: Okay
06.04.23, 19:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ready?
06.04.23, 19:58 - Niki: Yeah
06.04.23, 21:40 - Niki: I am still sorry 😔.
06.04.23, 21:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfftt, have fun ya goof, love ya ❤️
06.04.23, 21:42 - Niki: Love you too 😘. I have a bad feeling about "leaving you".
06.04.23, 21:42 - Niki: It feels like it was a bad decision
06.04.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How so? You can always call me again if you feel like it, don't worry about it and have fun playing games 😘
06.04.23, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also would tell you if I was unhappy (not that I'm happy normally when you leave but anyway) with you "leaving", so don't worry. I definitely get wanting to hang out with friends and I'm seeing you irl on Saturday anyway :)
06.04.23, 21:58 - Niki: Thanks that's reassuring. I am also really excited to see you again 🥰
06.04.23, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna drive home now
06.04.23, 22:25 - Niki: be Safe 😘
06.04.23, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got home, wasn't that bad of a drive but goddamn, some of those roads are not made for cyclists 😅
06.04.23, 23:01 - Niki: Yeah, I find it still crazy to drive with a bicycle on a daily in gent. Like dying on a daily is normal 😅
06.04.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, it's like that in all of Belgium, you get used to it. I've been cycling since I was 5 or 6
06.04.23, 23:10 - Niki: It's normal if you get used to it 😅
06.04.23, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough 😅
07.04.23, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
07.04.23, 00:26 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
07.04.23, 08:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning, how was your night & what are you up to today? 😘
07.04.23, 10:18 - Niki: Good morning I slept good my love ❤️. How did you sleep last night? Still tense? 
Nothing much probably some university stuff and relaxing with Alex  until I drive to my parents house.
07.04.23, 10:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, still woke up at 4 but it was better than yesterday. 100% am still stressing out but it's okay 😊
So you're gonna play DnD at your parents'?
07.04.23, 10:24 - Niki: Yeah I think so, still thinking when I am going to drive to them. Today or tomorrow but I am not sure 🤔
07.04.23, 10:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Whatever you think is best I guess? As long as you don't forget it's DnD at 7 ;)
07.04.23, 10:31 - Niki: Yeah not this time 😅
07.04.23, 11:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I accidentally learn how to do basic programming through this internship I will laugh my ass off
07.04.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On that note though... What the fuck is up with Google app scripts? I can't even open it for some reason 😭 
Anyway, I'll figure it out I guess
07.04.23, 11:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind... I got it somehow
07.04.23, 11:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Google sucks
07.04.23, 11:15 - Niki: xD but yeah google sucks
07.04.23, 11:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I thought I figured it out... 😭
07.04.23, 11:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.04.23, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not even my fault
07.04.23, 11:18 - Niki: i have no idea what is the error but good luck fixing it
07.04.23, 11:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, but like I said, isn't even my fault... It just doesn't want to open for some reason ^^'
07.04.23, 11:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And it does open from another file... I am absolutely stumped, this is great
07.04.23, 11:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.04.23, 11:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty sure I'm just being rejected by anything electronic now
07.04.23, 11:22 - Niki: xD well a new error can be better
07.04.23, 11:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How so? I've had 3 different ones pop up one after the other??
07.04.23, 11:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.04.23, 11:24 - Niki: Normally in programming, a new error is a good error. it means u made some progress
07.04.23, 11:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: … I have done nothing though, just gotten errors.. literally didn't change a thing
07.04.23, 11:27 - Niki: Well, that sucks then. Sp You just refreshed the site ?
07.04.23, 11:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
07.04.23, 11:28 - Niki: Weird still not working and same error ?
07.04.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... Have no clue what is wrong
07.04.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
07.04.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I even allowed cookies and all that to make sure that wasn't the issue
07.04.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same problem
07.04.23, 11:29 - Niki: Restart the pc
07.04.23, 11:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
07.04.23, 11:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... Now it's updating my computer... Who knows, maybe that was the issue
07.04.23, 11:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope
07.04.23, 11:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same problem 😅😭
07.04.23, 11:33 - Niki: mabye a diffrent browser ?
07.04.23, 11:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can try
07.04.23, 11:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's just weird, from 1 google sheets that I do not own, I can open it, from the one I do own I can't?
07.04.23, 11:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry for turning you into my technical help btw
07.04.23, 11:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And thank you helping 😘
07.04.23, 11:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *for
07.04.23, 11:35 - Niki: Mabye there are settings in the google sheet
07.04.23, 11:35 - Niki: no Problem
07.04.23, 11:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: hmm... That's kinda the thing though, I'm trying to access the settings kind of, I can check it out though
07.04.23, 11:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: After the updates :)
07.04.23, 11:51 - Niki: Tell me when you have a update or a new error code. Kinda interested in the problem
07.04.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: … It was very interesting... But opening it in google chrome fucking solved it... I feel fucking stupid, but I'm also so fucking happy it is solved (well, for now that is, watch me run into another brick wall that turns out to be a plastic bag in 5 minutes)
07.04.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Diese Nachricht wurde gelöscht.
07.04.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And in time for lunch, goddamn
07.04.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is done 😁
07.04.23, 12:10 - Niki: Nice 👍🏻
07.04.23, 12:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Again, thank you so much, you're the fucking best (not just saying this because you helped me, this is just a general fact 😘) and I'm really sorry for turning you into my personal technical help centre 😅❤️
07.04.23, 12:22 - Niki: For you anytime
07.04.23, 12:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <3
07.04.23, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (if I do things like this it's because I'm on my laptop and I just respond to the notification btw)
07.04.23, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day been so far though?
07.04.23, 16:10 - Niki: Sorry forgot to send the  message. Yeah my day was good. Now at my family house and went to drink Coffee at my sister's apartment with my family.
07.04.23, 16:12 - Niki: What are you up too? Did you finish the Google worksheet task?
07.04.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, enjoy the family time 😊
07.04.23, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I finished the task, my senior was very happy with it 😊
Now I have to look for some kind of tool to easily share and edit meeting recordings 😅
07.04.23, 16:16 - Niki: Nice hope you find something. Mabye chat gbt knows some 😅
07.04.23, 16:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll definitely ask chat gpt, our lord and saviour
07.04.23, 16:17 - Niki: Praise the lord 🙏🏼
07.04.23, 16:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Indeed. Blessed be the algorithm
07.04.23, 16:20 - Niki: If they Ai takes over we are ready
07.04.23, 16:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely 😂
07.04.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have absolutely no clue what to get your dad
07.04.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, if it's not beer that is
07.04.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I'd like to be creative
07.04.23, 17:19 - Niki: My family ask what you wanna eat tomorrow for when we gone grill
07.04.23, 17:20 - Niki: I have no idea too it's really hard every year for Christmas to get him something
07.04.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I eat anything, I don't really know?
07.04.23, 17:21 - Niki: Okay then fine they buy way too much everything time
07.04.23, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.04.23, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *polar bear
07.04.23, 17:26 - Niki: No i don't think that's a good Idea
07.04.23, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No shit 😂
07.04.23, 17:28 - Niki: 60/70 Schokolade is okay for his present
07.04.23, 17:28 - Niki: I ask him 😅
07.04.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're sweet
07.04.23, 17:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: However... I have pralines already, fuck it I'll figure it out
07.04.23, 17:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found like 20000 things that would be perfect for Aeneas though... What is up with all the cat things?
07.04.23, 17:36 - Niki: But Aeneas is also kinda easy to find something for 😄
07.04.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True that
07.04.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And chocolate it is btw
07.04.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Stores are almost closing and I have no creativity 😅
07.04.23, 17:39 - Niki: Nice hope you get home savely 😘
07.04.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love 😘
07.04.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I somehow probably found the only Belgian chocolate in this store with German translation on the packaging... And I didn't even do it intentionally
07.04.23, 18:04 - Niki: Nice
07.04.23, 21:07 - Niki: Everything okay?
07.04.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really, but I'll get over it. Just overthinking too much
07.04.23, 21:08 - Niki: Wanna talk about it?
07.04.23, 21:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: maybe? But we're playing right now so idk
07.04.23, 21:09 - Niki: Yeah okay mabye later?
07.04.23, 21:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay :)
07.04.23, 21:11 - Niki: Like to see your reaction to the text
07.04.23, 21:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute okay? I can't hide my reaction, I like getting messages from you 🥹
07.04.23, 22:14 - Niki: So what were you thinking about?
07.04.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uh... Like 20000 things?
07.04.23, 22:15 - Niki: Damm about the weekend?
07.04.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: -BAP 
-my internship and how it's going because we have an evaluation on the Tuesday after I get back
-meeting your family
-if I'm gonna be able to get up on time
-Jinte and the weird guy across her house
-renovations
07.04.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And then not sleeping well for the last week, it's got my head a bit messed up 😅
07.04.23, 22:17 - Niki: Yeah a lot of things are happening right now around you. Hope you can relax abit while your here. Will try my best do you can 🥰
07.04.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: -if I'm sure what I'm gonna study next year
The list can go on honestly 😅
07.04.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just really want to hug you, I'm happy I can do that tomorrow ❤️
07.04.23, 22:18 - Niki: Same i am so excited for tomorrow 🥰
07.04.23, 22:19 - Niki: But mabye you should go to bed now do you get some hours of sleep?
07.04.23, 22:19 - Niki: I don't want to force you to do it. But I think it would be better. Else we gone write some more
07.04.23, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh... I still have to finish packing + quite honestly I don't think I'll sleep a lot tonight anyway, too afraid to oversleep 😅
It's a very bad feature of mine when I have to get up early, but I wake up every few hours or every hour just in case 😅
07.04.23, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can write while I finish packing my bags?
07.04.23, 22:21 - Niki: Yeah would love too. What you do you need to pack?
07.04.23, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I still need to grab my hiking shoes and toiletries and all that + maybe some snacks for on the way
07.04.23, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and a book 😊
07.04.23, 22:23 - Niki: Snacks are important the hiking is btw 9km because my mom and sister complained about the long distance so we chose a smaller one
07.04.23, 22:23 - Niki: What book you gone read?
07.04.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, I got some chocolate for Easter so I'm definitely taking that! 
Oh okay, 9km is nice!
07.04.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... Don't know? Oh, probably the 'first' book in that Japanese series
07.04.23, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or maybe I'll pick another one... Definitely also taking my German course book so I can study some on the train
07.04.23, 22:26 - Niki: Nice yeah but you should also take some headphones with you for the train
07.04.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no worries, they're already in my bag. I don't think I could survive 7 hours on a train without my headphones 😅
07.04.23, 22:28 - Niki: Btw how many bags you gone take with you for the week?
07.04.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do I need to bring a towel?
07.04.23, 22:29 - Niki: No i can give you mine
07.04.23, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just a duffel bag and my school backpack I think should be enough
07.04.23, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 👍
07.04.23, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I started listening to a podcast this week, it's kinda nice to work while listening to it. It's basically just people going through subreddits
07.04.23, 22:31 - Niki: There are some funny, usefull and useless subreddit. It's kinda nice
07.04.23, 22:31 - Niki: It's a rabbit hole for the internet
07.04.23, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It definitely is... I've listened to I think maybe 3 episodes and it's so different everytime? But also damn people can be arseholes if you can believe those stories 😅
07.04.23, 22:34 - Niki: Yeah but I think most of them are not fully true
07.04.23, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, same, a lot of them are definitely overdramatized, especially the ones that concern weddings
07.04.23, 22:37 - Niki: It also crazy how some people say so much just  because they are anonymous
07.04.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly... Same thing with online reviews... Some people really think it's okay to bully someone because they can't see their face
07.04.23, 22:43 - Niki: Yeah it's kinda creepy to see that side of humanity/some people
07.04.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely... But there's also nice stories and nice people! I always like the ones where it's just 1 person talking about this 1 small act another person did for them and how much it brightened their day
07.04.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Those stories brighten my day 😊
07.04.23, 22:49 - Niki: Yeah they restore some of my faith in humanity
07.04.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp... They're part of the reason why I always try to smile when I have an interaction, however small, with someone I don't know in public, it's also just nice to get a smile back
07.04.23, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I'm done packing
07.04.23, 22:56 - Niki: Nice got everything?
07.04.23, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.04.23, 22:57 - Niki: Looks good
07.04.23, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I should probably go to sleep
07.04.23, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I don't really think I can 😅
07.04.23, 22:58 - Niki: Yeah Sounds like a good idea
07.04.23, 22:59 - Niki: I only have 5% left and no charger so it could be that I stop typing

08.04.23, 07:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know someone that's cuter
08.04.23, 07:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Go check out a mirror or turn on your front camera
08.04.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I got to Frankfurt, now hope I find the right trein to Leipzig I guess
08.04.23, 09:28 - Niki: You will get it I believe in you
08.04.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you end up sleeping more?
08.04.23, 09:29 - Niki: No much
08.04.23, 09:29 - Niki: Not much more
08.04.23, 09:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sad
08.04.23, 09:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I got food and I almost got pickpocketed :)
08.04.23, 09:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't like the Frankfurt station
08.04.23, 09:41 - Niki: Nobody does. What happened with the pick pocket?
08.04.23, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He tried something, but I didn't have anything in my pockets, so he quickly left again I guess, not entirely sure
08.04.23, 09:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Saw him try the same shit on other people too
08.04.23, 09:48 - Niki: Your in the last rain now?
08.04.23, 09:48 - Niki: Train
08.04.23, 09:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, still waiting for it
08.04.23, 09:49 - Niki: But know where it is?
08.04.23, 09:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm at the right perron (still no clue what that's called in english)
08.04.23, 09:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's supposed to leave at 9:58, but there's a delay of 5 minutes I think
08.04.23, 09:51 - Niki: Okay yeah sounds right with the delay and everything
08.04.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll let you know when the train actually ends up leaving
08.04.23, 09:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Almost got on the wrong train to Berlin 😅
08.04.23, 10:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I actually did get on it, couldn't find my seat and then walked off to find out it wasn't my train 😅
08.04.23, 10:02 - Niki: Well you found the right one now?
08.04.23, 10:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp... So happy I got a reservation for a seat after all, the train is absolutely packed 😅
08.04.23, 10:05 - Niki: Nice hope your neighbor are nice people for the train ride
08.04.23, 10:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The person next to me is an absolute sweetheart
08.04.23, 10:07 - Niki: What happend?
08.04.23, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I booked a seat, and I sat down, but wasn't sure it was the right train, so kinda panicked a little bit but she was very nice and talked to me. Seems like a very nice person, might talk some more during the trip 😊
08.04.23, 10:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, and the train is on it's way!
08.04.23, 10:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should be in Leipzig around 13:15 😊
08.04.23, 10:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She also offered me candy... I.. so sweet
08.04.23, 10:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not taking candy from strangers though, no worries
08.04.23, 11:04 - Niki: Nice hope you have a nice conversation with her
08.04.23, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, we're both doing our own thing now, but we had a nice conversation at the start, she's a considerably better seatmate than the guy I sat with on the way to Kortrijk 2 weeks ago 😂
08.04.23, 11:06 - Niki: Yeah nice
08.04.23, 11:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's your day been like so far?
08.04.23, 11:25 - Niki: Yeah hanging out with my sister and brought a Ester gift for our neffew.
08.04.23, 11:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cute, what did you get him?
08.04.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (also just to make sure but you're picking me up from the train station right?)
08.04.23, 11:28 - Niki: Yeah no worries 😅
08.04.23, 11:28 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
08.04.23, 11:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Always a good gift
08.04.23, 11:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're not gonna believe this... But the train is running 3 minutes faster than scheduled, so far at least
08.04.23, 12:09 - Niki: It's a Ester miricale
08.04.23, 12:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess so indeed 😂
08.04.23, 12:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll be there in an hour 😁😘

14.04.23, 14:18 - Niki: There is camile tee in the kitchen. Alex made it but  he did take all
14.04.23, 14:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, thanks for letting me know :)
14.04.23, 16:38 - Niki: In our way now
14.04.23, 16:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okido!
16.04.23, 14:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I did great, booked a seat in the toddler area 😅
16.04.23, 14:50 - Niki: Well atleast i won't get boring
16.04.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely shouldn't cry now, poor kid, don't want to traumatize the kid
16.04.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, for now the child seems really nice
16.04.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And quiet

16.04.23, 15:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let’s make a playlist together, join and edit: Reading & hiking
https://spotify.link/37JxXvqT2yb
16.04.23, 15:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (the title is a work in progress)
16.04.23, 15:33 - Niki: Like the title
16.04.23, 15:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would you please for the love of god drive home safely before you answer me? But thanks, we can keep it that way then :)
16.04.23, 17:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Arriving to Frankfurt now
16.04.23, 17:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you doing? Playing games?
16.04.23, 17:48 - Niki: yea
16.04.23, 17:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun 😊
16.04.23, 17:50 - Niki: thx
16.04.23, 18:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Trying to speak German 😅🥲
16.04.23, 18:07 - Niki: xD
16.04.23, 18:07 - Niki: and how does it go ?
16.04.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just said 'es ist mein' and then surprisingly he didn't laugh at me
16.04.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Continued in German until I answered in English
16.04.23, 18:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also found out that the wifi connection on the train is shit, so I've been reading fanfiction for the last 3 hours 😅
16.04.23, 18:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Andddd... They are calling off pickpockets again... Gotta love Frankfurt and Brussels
16.04.23, 18:16 - Niki: xD well they also need to make so money i guess
16.04.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfffttt, yeah, I guess so indeed!
16.04.23, 20:13 - Niki: How is the train ride going so far? Where are you at now?
16.04.23, 20:14 - Niki: Still reading fanfictions
16.04.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The train ride is going well so far, do hope we don't fall behind on time much more or I'll miss my connection in Brussel 😅... But yeah, next stop is Aachen in an hour. 
Yup, still reading fanfictions, but the one I'm reading now is really well written. What are you up to? Still gaming? I hope you didn't forget to change the sheets 😘
16.04.23, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely gonna miss my connection 😅... The train has stopped in the middle of nowhere and we can even go outside for a walk if we want to 😭
16.04.23, 20:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for laughing at my misery 😭
16.04.23, 20:35 - Niki: Sorry 😅. How are the other people on the train /kids? Whats the Fandom of the fanfictions. Yeah most of the time you can't go out exepte for real old trains or if you are in the front train part
16.04.23, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, I'm in the front train part... I think? Train started moving again but now in the other direction, I'm slightly confused. The other people are nice I guess? No screaming kids and all that, so it's peaceful. A lot of soldiers though? 
The fandom is Merlin, I always hated the ending so I love it when they change that up :)
What are you up to?
16.04.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh btw, what does 'warten auf anschlussreisende' mean?
16.04.23, 20:39 - Niki: "waiting for connecting travelers"
16.04.23, 20:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Huh... Okay, thanks!
16.04.23, 20:40 - Niki: people that want to take the train too but are coming from another train
16.04.23, 20:41 - Niki: I never watch merlin fully but kinda want to. Don't spoil the end pls. We can watch it together sometime?
16.04.23, 20:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's been a while since I saw it fully, sure we can watch it together sometime :) just absolutely no clue where we could watch it but I'm sure there's some place. (I promise I won't spoil the ending)
16.04.23, 20:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now for the third time, how is your evening going? ❤️
16.04.23, 20:53 - Niki: Oh yeah sorry forgot to answer that 😅 My evening is going great playing lol with Elias, Marco, Hirschi (one of the two guys I told you about today that life in Leipzig and only work part time) and Fabian how doesn't normally play with us lol.
16.04.23, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes I noticed you forgot 😂
Sounds nice, hope you have a fun time! I also feel like you'll be hearing from Fabian a lot more in the future 😅
16.04.23, 21:03 - Niki: Yeah I think so too
16.04.23, 21:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We ended up using 11, not 10 :)
16.04.23, 21:38 - Niki: Yeah you right. How you got to that topic?
16.04.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, just randomly thought of it
16.04.23, 21:39 - Niki: Okay but yeah you right. Still on the time schedule? You get your next train?
16.04.23, 21:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you really want to know the thought process it was something like: eating chocolate, licking the chocolate off my fingers, remembering you kissing my hands and well... that led to other things :)
16.04.23, 21:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, still on schedule so far so I should get to my next train!

I'm not in my bed yet, but I'm sure it will feel cold and lonely too 🥲
17.04.23, 01:25 - Niki: By the way it's crazy how much I miss you. I lay in bed for a hour and all my thoughts go back to one think and that is you❤️. I never had that happen before. I am amazed at what you do to me 😳
17.04.23, 01:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel the same way, I just can't fall asleep feeling like this... I wish I could hug you or I could turn around and start kissing your shoulders, but when I turn around now it's just empty... It sucks and I already can't wait to be with you again ❤️
17.04.23, 01:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you 😘

17.04.23, 19:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It has escalated... My dad broke the pasta in 2, how are we even related???
17.04.23, 19:37 - Niki: xD i get that man. He wants to eat faster and easier. I think it was the right choice 😂😅
17.04.23, 19:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah mate... Can't fucking believe him 😂
17.04.23, 19:41 - Niki: He joined the darkside now
17.04.23, 19:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough, I heard they have cookies
17.04.23, 19:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Funny to think the Italians are on the light side for once
17.04.23, 20:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question... We watched YouTube videos together one time, but what website did you use to be able to watch that together?
17.04.23, 20:13 - Niki: https://w2g.tv/
17.04.23, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love 😘
17.04.23, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just realised I should have left half the lovers tea box with you, that way we could drink tea together on date night... Ah... Thought of it too late 😅
17.04.23, 20:24 - Niki: Yeah would have been nice but I can buy myself a lovers tea box
17.04.23, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True true
17.04.23, 20:25 - Niki: Nice idea still. Will do love 🥰
17.04.23, 20:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute, the cat was right ;)
17.04.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening going?
17.04.23, 21:54 - Niki: Going okay wanted to do university stuff but Marco wanted do something so we are playing some games now 😅
17.04.23, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun, hope you get to do something productive though 😘
17.04.23, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't get you out of my head. Practically everywhere I look I see you. It's in really stupid things or random people most of the time, but you're always to be found somewhere
17.04.23, 23:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, I'm going to sleep now. I kinda hope this follows me to my dreams so I can see you there too
17.04.23, 23:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
17.04.23, 23:14 - Niki: Goodnight love ❤️
17.04.23, 23:16 - Niki: Have the same thing but it's more of thinking of anything leeds me to you if my mind idles for a few seconds it goes back to you 🫠.
17.04.23, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's definitely there too ❤️
18.04.23, 09:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, hope you slept better tonight than last night! 😘
What do you have planned today?
18.04.23, 09:20 - Niki: I sleept quit good didn't wake up this night. how was you night? Going to university and my plan for today is just university. What about you any plans for the today except work?
18.04.23, 09:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Slept quite good as well :)
I just have work today, got nothing else planned
18.04.23, 10:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do have my evaluation for work today though... Was fine with it but now I'm getting kinda stressed 😅
18.04.23, 10:16 - Niki: No worrys you got this. Is it from your work or university?
18.04.23, 10:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was from my uni
18.04.23, 10:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Went pretty well I think, didn't know what to expect from it though 😅
18.04.23, 11:05 - Niki: Nice What did they ask you? And now your heading back to work?
18.04.23, 11:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was actually at my work, they came to visit to check on us today. They basically just asked us to showcase our progress... Which was fucking vague but I feel like I did quite a good job since she said we're doing good afterwards
18.04.23, 11:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
18.04.23, 11:16 - Niki: Nice i think your one of the few persons who actually work 😅. Just out of the thinks I heard from the others in your BAP. My day is going alright but I need to stay in university for 4 hours again 🥲
18.04.23, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, yeah... It does sound that way 😅
Hope you manage to entertain yourself for those 4 hours somehow... 😘
18.04.23, 12:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out I'm not done with the cookie policy yet 😅
18.04.23, 12:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: CEO guy wants to talk to me about it next week
18.04.23, 12:31 - Niki: Well nice i guess? You doing the same Präsentation you did befor ?
18.04.23, 12:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I think he wants to know if I could write the privacy policy for them... I mean, I guess I can try but I'm not entirely sure about it, it's a legal document you know? if I do something wrong the company could get sued in the future. Then again, their own fault for giving this task to an intern! How's it going? Not too bored yet?
18.04.23, 12:34 - Niki: Nah i am good i just work on other stuff 😅. Yeah if he ask you to do it. I would kinda protrest against it because yeah your a intern
18.04.23, 12:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I think I will protest against it, though it does seems really interesting to do, but probably a bit too risky when I have absolutely no experience with writing legal documents. Not entirely sure that's what he's gonna ask though, but we'll see.
18.04.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When do you want to do datenight this week?
18.04.23, 15:05 - Niki: Still Thursday would work I guess or Wednesday?
18.04.23, 15:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Both of those work for me, whatever you would prefer is fine by me :)
18.04.23, 17:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm done with work 🥳 how's your afternoon class?
18.04.23, 17:47 - Niki: Driving back now
18.04.23, 17:48 - Niki: I would do date night on  Thursday's. How was the rest of your work day?
18.04.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds good, hope you won't be too tired from classes though
18.04.23, 17:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The rest of my workday was chill, had about 3 meetings but they were all good
18.04.23, 17:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Drive safe
18.04.23, 17:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was also asked for relationship advice because I'm "Belgian" and they don't understand Belgian guys 😂
18.04.23, 17:58 - Niki: What wait explain. I am kinda confused. They don't understand belgium guys or you don't understand belgium guys?
18.04.23, 17:58 - Niki: Mabye I will work today on a classes of Thursday 😅
18.04.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They don't understand Belgian guys, which is completely fair because they're a fucking mess and VERY different from Italian/Spanish guys
18.04.23, 18:00 - Niki: Okay seems reasonable I guys can't really talk about no personal experience 😅
18.04.23, 18:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey... We both know you're a massive procrastinator... But if you manage to do that I will be impressed for sure! 😊
18.04.23, 18:01 - Niki: Yeah I know but I accapt the challenge
18.04.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not like I have much experience either (literally none) but I have friends who are guys and I have friends who have dated guys
18.04.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let's go, you can do it 😘
18.04.23, 18:02 - Niki: I would say that's kinda personal experience
18.04.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe a little, I guess I do know enough about it
18.04.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enough so that I chose to date a German ;)
18.04.23, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening?
18.04.23, 22:26 - Niki: Probably sleeping soon. I am kinda tired though the howl day btw i got the classes done for Thursday ☺️. How is your night going?
18.04.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, also going to go to sleep soon. From tomorrow on I have to be in work earlier because we have a meeting every day at 9 😅
Damn, I'm impressed! Well done my love! 😘 
My evening is uh ... Interesting? My parents have been talking about the renovations with 1 of their friends all evening and god... I am so looking up against them... The house is gonna be a fucking mess for at least 3 months 😭
18.04.23, 22:31 - Niki: Love you the mental image that you painted. Like you just hearing your parents talk just more and more about renovations. Sucks you need to wake up early but you get off early right?
18.04.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... I'm basically just sitting in between them listening to what exactly is going to happen and the more I hear the more I wonder what the fuck we're going to do for those 3 months because we won't be able to do anything at all downstairs? No kitchen, no living room, nothing 😅 I fucking hope it's this summer so I can work for a month and then be gone or something for the rest of it 😅
I sure hope I get off earlier but idk... Might get Thursday and Friday off though, the rest of the office has teambuilding
18.04.23, 22:36 - Niki: I pray for your free Thursday and Friday 🙏🏼. Well if you don't have a kitch for 3 months Damm that's sucks. I mean living room okayish I guess but kitchen just straight up sucks
18.04.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, living room is fine, we just move that up to my room, but no kitchen... My dad and I will be bitching about it before 3 days have passed 😅 guess we'll see
18.04.23, 23:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
18.04.23, 23:28 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
19.04.23, 09:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning, how was your night?
19.04.23, 11:23 - Niki: Good morning my night was pretty relaxing. Had a weird dream about my exsame. How was your night?
19.04.23, 11:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a good night I guess. Went to work without my laptop though because I'm forgetful as hell, working from home now 😅
How's your day looking?
19.04.23, 11:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: hopefully as good as you ;)
19.04.23, 12:39 - Niki: Went pretty well so far. Went to the Carre day of my university. And now heading back home to eat lunch. Also Alex ask how was the nicest out of my friends/the coolest?
19.04.23, 12:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Carré day? What's that? 
If he'd asked funniest I'd have said him, but coolest/nicest... I have to think about this one
19.04.23, 12:48 - Niki: Career day is just a bunch of firmes come to university to present the self.
19.04.23, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, career day! That makes more sense 😅
19.04.23, 12:48 - Niki: Alex was shocked that he wasn't the coolest 😅
19.04.23, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He might be, still overthinking it
19.04.23, 12:49 - Niki: Yeah sorry my bad 😅
19.04.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Might make a spreadsheet on it 😜
19.04.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was the career day? Anything interesting?
19.04.23, 12:49 - Niki: Yeah found two frims that are really interesting will see
19.04.23, 12:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice!
19.04.23, 12:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I will have to disappoint Alex and go with Ole... But only because he has 2 cats and nothing can beat that
19.04.23, 12:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He gets second place though, if that's any consolation
19.04.23, 12:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (also skip the fact that I only saw him for a total of 4 hours and know practically nothing about him at all 👍)
19.04.23, 13:14 - Niki: Alex has a cute but old dog. (Alex wants you to know) 😅
19.04.23, 13:14 - Niki: How is working from home?
19.04.23, 13:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah okay, but have I seen the dog in person? No. If I do I might change my mind 😊
19.04.23, 13:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh... Not motivation to do anything honestly, especially since there's no time limit on the task I'm supposed to do. Very nice to have Mousti with me though
19.04.23, 13:20 - Niki: Well can't help you with the motivation but atleast you have Moustache
19.04.23, 13:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True! I also did something I think you will enjoy, but I'm keeping it for tomorrow 😁
19.04.23, 14:51 - Niki: I kinda curious to know what you mean 😳
19.04.23, 14:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't expect too much, it's just something funny :)
19.04.23, 15:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm so happy, I don't have to go to work for the rest of the week! :)
19.04.23, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day been so far?
19.04.23, 18:54 - Niki: Doing pretty good relaxing now and then taking a shower befor doing some university.
Later mabye go with Alex and Killian to the free food think  How about you? 
What are you up to now?
19.04.23, 18:54 - Niki: Weird spacing sorry 😅
19.04.23, 18:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, hope the food tastes alright 😊
I'm just about to cook dinner, got nothing else planned after that
19.04.23, 18:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't see why you should apologize for that?? Also I do the same spacing so often 😂
19.04.23, 18:57 - Niki: Yeah I don't know felt right to say sorry for that mess of a text 😅. What are you cooking today?
19.04.23, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey... No offence but you've written a lot of texts that were less understandable than that one 😂 (but it's cute, I don't mind it 😘)
Probably a curry or maybe chili con carne? Not entirely sure yet
19.04.23, 19:01 - Niki: Thanks honey love that you love my flaws 🥰
Nice you can fix anything up hope you will be happy with it. (everyone else will be impressed with the food but your sometimes abit hard on your self. Love that about you 🥰)
19.04.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now how the fuck am I supposed to react to that 🥹
You're too sweet, and your 'flaws' are just more parts of you that make me even more interested 😘
19.04.23, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also really random but I got a notification not to take the train in Germany tomorrow because there will be strikes... So I guess you shouldn't take the train tomorrow?
19.04.23, 19:11 - Niki: Sweet of you to tell me 🥰. Yeah its kinda big because there striking again which is kinda weird for the german workers then normal only strike once a year. So we will see if the get what they want
19.04.23, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn... You guys strike once a year? Fuck, wish that was the case over here, public transport strikes at least once every month...
19.04.23, 19:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm crying... Fucking onions
19.04.23, 19:40 - Niki: I feel your pain. I wish I could help
19.04.23, 19:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, it's fine, I'm just pissed off by it because I'm crying more over some onions than I cried over leaving you and honestly onions aren't worth the tears
19.04.23, 19:42 - Niki: Now you making me cry
19.04.23, 19:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The only time I have ever seen you 'cry' and I'm not even sure that was you crying was back in Norway on the accidental sleepover... I don't think I would like to see you cry necessarily but it's cute to think of 😘 (though it also breaks my heart to think of, complex feelings idk)
19.04.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've actually always wondered, did you cry that night? Because I know there was a kind of joke that I was the only one not to but I was never sure
19.04.23, 19:48 - Niki: Yeah I cried probably because the amount of emotions in the room. It was along time since I cryed befor that. It was kinda relieving to cry again.
19.04.23, 19:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Crying is kinda relieving yeah, definitely. And emotions... Goddamn, that was indeed such an emotional evening, but I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world
19.04.23, 19:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: All of us needed that night
19.04.23, 19:57 - Niki: Yeah great memory was one of the best night in Norway night.
19.04.23, 20:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, either that night or the night after that
19.04.23, 20:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
19.04.23, 20:17 - Niki: Looks pretty good
19.04.23, 20:17 - Niki: Hope you don't have problems with the rice
19.04.23, 20:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah well... No rice cooker so the rice can never be perfect I'm afraid 🥲
19.04.23, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So Alex asked who I thought was the coolest of your friends... Has he said anything else? I'm too curious for my own good
19.04.23, 20:33 - Niki: He ask some questions will write you then later. We are at the open kitchen now.
19.04.23, 20:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oki, have fun/have a nice meal 😘
20.04.23, 01:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
20.04.23, 08:35 - Niki: Good morning my love 😘
Sorry my phone died yesterday. How was your night yesterday and how did you sleep last night? The thing Alex ask:
-what you thought about the ass smacking. (as a joke if you would join)
-What you thought about our apparment
-He thought that I kept you away in my room. That got me thinking maybe I kept you away from them but not sure. If I was it wasn't a conscious decision.
20.04.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning honey ❤️
Ah, modern technology can't be trusted anymore these days 😜
I slept alright I guess, last night was okayish, stayed up way too late for absolutely no reason 😅
How was your evening and night? Was the food alright?
20.04.23, 09:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The ass smacking was very funny, definitely didn't mind that 😂 wouldn't join though, sorry to disappoint him :)
Your apartment is really nice, I really liked it! 
I don't think you actively tried to keep me away from them, I think it was also partially me just retreating there whenever I felt awkward, so definitely not just up to you. I think if I would go back it would be different now though, because I've gotten to know them a little already so I would feel less uncomfortable
20.04.23, 09:15 - Niki: Yeah the night was nice played some Foosball and the food was actually pretty good but there was practically nothing left. So I was the only one that got some of it 😅.
20.04.23, 09:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, too bad you were the only one that got the food though
20.04.23, 09:39 - Niki: Yeah I think so too. It will change when you come over again.
20.04.23, 09:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely :)
20.04.23, 09:42 - Niki: You have home office for the rest of the week right? And how is it to be home all day but not really because you need to work?
20.04.23, 09:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You see... That's the best part, I don't even have to work.. I literally have 2 days off simply because no one else is working either
20.04.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But honestly I don't really like home office when I'm alone, did it twice now and I lose focus really fast. It would be better if the tasks I have to do were more interesting or if there was another person home, but yeah, I think I'll keep going into the office as much as I can for this internship.
20.04.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't you have class right now?
20.04.23, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aeneas just asked if he can call us tonight
20.04.23, 13:32 - Niki: I am okay befor date night or while?
20.04.23, 13:32 - Niki: Yeah started 9:45
20.04.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Rather before, that way we can still have some time for ourselves, if that's possible? Idk
20.04.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, okay, makes sense
20.04.23, 13:33 - Niki: What did you do today and what are your plans for today?
20.04.23, 13:34 - Niki: Okay mabye 19:00 or early I don't know how long we gone call
20.04.23, 13:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have done absolutely nothing so far, but I'm gonna clean the kitchen, my bedroom and do some laundry. How was class?
20.04.23, 13:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I'll ask him if 19 is okay for him, probably gonna call around an hour depending on what happened since last week
20.04.23, 13:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 19 is good for him
20.04.23, 13:36 - Niki: Exhausting to be honest and now I need to overlook them again 😓
20.04.23, 13:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodluck with overlooking the class, maybe take a nap if you're too tired?
20.04.23, 13:37 - Niki: Yeah gone do that now thanks ☺️
20.04.23, 17:57 - Niki: What are you up to? How was cleaning the house?
20.04.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did not clean as much as I wanted, I'm just about to get started on dinner. How's your afternoon been and what are you up to?
20.04.23, 17:59 - Niki: Felt kinda shity after the small nap. But getting better probably some university now after I eat  dinner
20.04.23, 18:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... Naps have a 50-50 chance of feeling worse or better, you never know what you'll get
20.04.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you get something done and that you eat something nice, but please don't forget we're calling Aeneas in an hour 😘
20.04.23, 18:03 - Niki: Yeah no worrys got that in my mind else I would still turn around in bed 😅. What you making for dinner just out of curiosity?
20.04.23, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahaha, fair enough! I'm making Tikka Massala 😋
20.04.23, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you gonna eat for dinner?
20.04.23, 18:07 - Niki: No idea what it is. I made just pasta with some Tomatensauce.
20.04.23, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll send you a picture when it's done, I think you'd like it though, it's Indian
20.04.23, 18:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Once again... Fucking onions... WHY do they have to make your food taste better, but... You have to cut them without being able to see because they fucking make you tear up... It's a miracle more people don't lose a finger cutting these things...
20.04.23, 18:37 - Niki: Again i wish I could cut them for you 😅
20.04.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, don't worry about it, if we were in the kitchen together I would still cut them because I hate them myself, wouldn't want to subject you to the horror 😘
20.04.23, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This situation is actually a really good case to explain how some people (mostly girls) don't always want a solution, I just wanna bitch about them 😅
20.04.23, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would love to have you here as emotional support though ;)
20.04.23, 18:44 - Niki: But I would love to cute them for you well. I also thought about a video where somebody put on diving Googels too cut onions. Well I believe in your cooking skills that no onion will ever keep you from cooking a good meal 😅
20.04.23, 18:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (not saying I wouldn't appreciate a solution though, but that's not the aim, idk)
20.04.23, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I've tried like a billion of those so called 'tips' to cut onions but so far the only ones that actually work are to use a very sharp knife, water on your hands and cutting them under the ventilator, and yet... still crying every time
20.04.23, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I refuse to use the diving goggles... Just no
20.04.23, 18:48 - Niki: I think only a weird person would do.
20.04.23, 18:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte would for sure
20.04.23, 18:48 - Niki: You can rent more if you want to i think I will get the renting thing at some point 😅
20.04.23, 18:49 - Niki: I thought so too
20.04.23, 18:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for the offer love ❤
20.04.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll be a bit late, still cooking, you gonna start the call with Aeneas already?

20.04.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
20.04.23, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dude... You're too fucking gorgeous I can't, I've been staring at your face basically the whole call
20.04.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So far for datenight I guess 😅
20.04.23, 21:25 - Niki: Yeah I mean we can stil call but I am not sure how long we gone call then? Or we gone move it to Sunday Or Saturday? To be honest I got kinda tired though the call
20.04.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I get it... I like calling Aeneas but I do have to say it kinda sucks 😅
We can call for a little bit more? I still wanna show you something if you're up for it. Not sure about Saturday, idk when I'll be back home if I go to Paris. Sunday could work though
20.04.23, 21:28 - Niki: Okay yeah then gone call you in 10 min and date night on Sunday?

21.04.23, 09:37 - Niki: Yeah but I doubt it will be interesting to be honest 🥲. What are your plans for today until the reunion?
21.04.23, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna go visit my grandma and then after Alex's classes we're gonna meet up, no clue what we'll do yet though
21.04.23, 09:49 - Niki: Say Hi to your grandma for me and Alex (if you want). Hope you have fun with Alex 😘
21.04.23, 09:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, will do ❤️
21.04.23, 11:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, maybe random question but are your grandparents on your dad's side doing alright? Last I heard was 1 of them had to go to the hospital and I just hope they're alright 😅
21.04.23, 11:54 - Niki: Yeah there Allright i think not live threating
21.04.23, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, okay, that's good!
21.04.23, 16:37 - Niki: How is your day going  already with Alex? What are you up too?
21.04.23, 16:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My day is going well, visited my grandparents and now I'm at a park with Alex, having a small picnic. How's your day?
21.04.23, 16:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
21.04.23, 16:39 - Niki: Meet up with Alex online talking a bit. Then took a shower gone head out soon for the wizard tournament. Sounds nice say hi to Alex

21.04.23, 16:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex said you're welcome 😂
21.04.23, 16:41 - Niki: Will do by the way when you need to go to reunion?
21.04.23, 16:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It starts in 45 minutes
21.04.23, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Being back here is fucking weird 😅 xx
21.04.23, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
21.04.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I both missed this and absolutely didn't want to come back here ever, it's a weird feeling...
Also there's just me and 1 other guy here in the management and administration classroom... I... 😅
21.04.23, 17:40 - Niki: Yeah get the same feeling with my old school
21.04.23, 17:50 - Niki: The schoolyard looks kinda weird 😅. Hope some more people come soon
21.04.23, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, it's weird, we dont really have a schoolyard 😅... That's the parking
21.04.23, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No one has come to the classroom yet 😂
21.04.23, 20:34 - Niki: Sadly hope it gets better over the night
21.04.23, 20:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahah, we've long since moved on from the classrooms 😂 now we're just socialising, crazy how everyone just goes back to the exact same groups as in high school
21.04.23, 20:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the tournament? Are you winning (son)? 😜
21.04.23, 22:03 - Niki: Nah I lossing but with fun. It's a shit show at my table most of the time
21.04.23, 22:03 - Niki: You talk with most of them
21.04.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah... There were way too many people it was too much 😅
21.04.23, 22:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love that, having fun while losing is the best without a doubt
21.04.23, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're going out now to a queer bar 😊🥳
21.04.23, 22:26 - Niki: Hope you have a great time
21.04.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm sure we will, the people we're with are very funny when you think about it... Because technically there's 2 ex couples here... Jinte and her ex and Alex and I (though to be fair I don't think we counted it's funny to think about) 😂
21.04.23, 22:37 - Niki: How is the situation between jinte and her ex
21.04.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty good, they're friends
21.04.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's actually a lot of fun 😊
21.04.23, 22:51 - Niki: Nice have a fun time 😘
21.04.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will do 😘
21.04.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You still at the tournament?
21.04.23, 22:54 - Niki: Yeah at the Ende
21.04.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also found our I can't go to Paris tomorrow 😭 something doesn't work with the ticket
21.04.23, 23:28 - Niki: That sucks but I would be a pack weekend. Mabye it's better you can relax abit 😘. Have great night I am going to bed now 
Goodnight ❤️
21.04.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, you're right, just sad that I disappointed Aeneas honestly, and that I can't see Jingwen tomorrow
21.04.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️
22.04.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte is annoying as hell and I'm 100% sure everyone in this bar thinks we're dating now... Sometimes I wonder why I am friends with this child 😅
22.04.23, 10:26 - Niki: Good morning my love 😘. How was your night and the rest of the evening yesterday?
22.04.23, 10:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon 😘
Slept pretty good, only just work up. The rest of the evening was very nice, got home at 1 or something like that.
How was your night and what do you have planned for today?
22.04.23, 10:39 - Niki: Nothing much planned except some university and house stuff, playing games with my friends.
What are your plans for today now that you can't go to Paris? Mabye a bit of driving? 🥰
22.04.23, 10:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, have fun playing games and good luck with the chores/university work.
I have no actual plans today because until last night I was still planning on going to Paris... But yeah, maybe driving, idk though, my parents are probably out all day to fix things for the renovations.
22.04.23, 11:34 - Niki: You can drive them to get the things probably takes for ever so nevermind.
22.04.23, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They were also already gone before I woke up so yeah 😅
22.04.23, 14:07 - Niki: Wait i saw on Instagram something? You rewatching young royals?
22.04.23, 14:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... No, I was listening to the soundtrack (great fucking soundtrack) and wanted to rewatch it but I didn't end up doing so 😅 I got a bit lost in my thoughts so I'm writing a story now 😅 
What are you doing?
22.04.23, 14:10 - Niki: Shopping right now. What's story your writing about? Kinda out of context but 2 of the people from the tournament yesterday are trying to write and publish books right now.
22.04.23, 14:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't really know what the story is about yet, still on the first page, but the main character is someone that was controlled throughout her whole life, and when she finally found some freedom she took advantage of that to break out of the control her family had on her. So I guess the main story will be seeing her show her family how she has outgrown the boundaries they put on her. If I ever manage to write that much 😅
That's so cool! writing a book and publishing it is really difficult, I hope they get there!
22.04.23, 14:19 - Niki: Sounds nice mabye if you got some pages. You could send it too me. Would love to read it. I don't know why but it kinda interests me. But normally I don't read that much and especially ot over that kinda off topic. Hope you can make sense out of this message 😅
22.04.23, 14:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I get to a couple of pages I'll send it to you, it's kinda shit now though 😅 Yeah, I guess it's kinda odd that it interests you, but if you want to give it a try, why not? Fair warning though, it's probably gonna be pretty dark, revenge arc and all that. I also don't know why I'm writing about this honestly, probably the influence of the music I was listening to?
22.04.23, 14:24 - Niki: Yeah would like to 🥰. Yeah Musik is a big mood changer and motivator in my case 😊
22.04.23, 14:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 🥰 Same, music does a LOT
22.04.23, 14:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Update, might be a story about oppression through police violence and blind loyalty to the established hierarchy... I don't know exactly where this came from. Still on the first page 😅
22.04.23, 14:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Another update, I'm deleting everything because it's too political :))))
22.04.23, 15:48 - Niki: Okay sad but okay  political is a hard topic. Even on family gatherings
22.04.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, and I don't feel like doing a lot of research to make sure it makes sense 😅
22.04.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On another note, probably not gonna study in Antwerp after all. I found a study program in Gent that allows me to get a master's in 2 years instead of 4 like in Antwerp 😊
22.04.23, 16:26 - Niki: Nice whats the name of the program and what exactly your gone do there?
22.04.23, 16:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Master of science in commercial sciences with a major in management and ICT
22.04.23, 16:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's a switch year first, mostly general courses so I can learn the 'academic way of doing things' and then the master itself is the basics of programming (I think mostly Python), databases and all that, as well as ICT management of projects, those kinds of things.
22.04.23, 16:30 - Niki: Nice sounds really interesting. Kinda excited for you and happy
22.04.23, 16:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love, I'm also happy I'd only have to do 2 years more, allows a lot more options for the future
22.04.23, 17:14 - Niki: I genuinely happy for you and it makes me happy.
22.04.23, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're fucking cute, you know that? I love you
22.04.23, 17:27 - Niki: Love you too 😘
22.04.23, 19:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question... You ever gone to a really fancy restaurant?
22.04.23, 19:49 - Niki: No
22.04.23, 19:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... Uhm... In that case a fair warning for when we go to Berlin, because my dad likes to go to fancy restaurants so yeah... A first time for everything?
22.04.23, 19:51 - Niki: Yeah mabye you can give me crash course 😅
22.04.23, 19:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, of course, no problem, it's not that hard anyway, it's just food you know?
22.04.23, 19:52 - Niki: Yeah I don't know i can fuck up anything
22.04.23, 19:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you wanna know what restaurant we're going to I can send you the link to the website
22.04.23, 19:53 - Niki: Na no worries
22.04.23, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, no worries, plus, it's not like we're stuck up, most of the time we don't really care about etiquette anyway
22.04.23, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll be just fine
22.04.23, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have full faith in you ;)
22.04.23, 19:55 - Niki: What are you up to?
22.04.23, 19:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom also wanted me to emphasize once more that this is all my dad's idea, my mom and I couldn't care less where we go to eat 😅 (and she feels slightly bad for putting the pressure of going there on you)
22.04.23, 19:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing much, just reading a bit. What are you up to?
22.04.23, 19:59 - Niki: Yeah no worries. I am totally fine with it. Please tell your mom not to worry about it ☺️
22.04.23, 20:00 - Niki: Cooking right now. What are you reading?
22.04.23, 20:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, that's good, I'll tell her ❤
22.04.23, 20:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: … merlin fanfiction again... I don't know why but they're always so well written and I just like how they change the ending (no worries, I won't spoil) What are you cooking?
22.04.23, 20:03 - Niki: Just pasta
22.04.23, 20:03 - Niki: I think i really need to get into the merlin TV show.
22.04.23, 20:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope with some sauce or at least cheese? I've learnt not to assume that though... Asked Jinte one time and learned she literally just ate bland pasta 😅🥲
22.04.23, 20:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can watch it together some time if you really want to get into it
22.04.23, 20:06 - Niki: Yeah no worrys with a sauce. Jinte is a sick and twisted person. Yeah we can tomorrow?
22.04.23, 20:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte is indeed a sick and twisted person. We can do that, not sure where to find it though... I'll do some research :)
22.04.23, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening been so far?
22.04.23, 22:22 - Niki: Been playing with Elias, Hirschi and Marco for 2 hours now. Getting tired mabye one hour more or so. What are you up too?
22.04.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which game(s) are you playing? Still reading, my parents are watching a series, it's a chill evening.
22.04.23, 22:27 - Niki: Nice relaxing. Mostly lol and some indie games befor with Elias
23.04.23, 00:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you and somehow I haven't been able to stop thinking about you for the past hour, which is quite annoying because it also means I can't read my book with full attention. So screw you for being too loveable and amazing and just... urg, I love you but the fact that you exist is distracting as hell
23.04.23, 00:08 - Niki: Love you hopefully you can read with out thinking about me tomorrow 😘
23.04.23, 00:08 - Niki: Still date night tomorrow right?
23.04.23, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course we're still doing datenight tomorrow, you can bet your arse I'm looking forward to that
23.04.23, 00:09 - Niki: Cutie 😘
23.04.23, 00:10 - Niki: But I am going to sleep now. 
Goodnight ❤️
23.04.23, 00:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is absolutely unfair how you just send me a message that says 'cutie 😘' and my heart just skips a beat... Who the fuck gave you that power?
23.04.23, 00:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm also going to sleep now I think
23.04.23, 00:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤
23.04.23, 00:11 - Niki: You gave me that power and no take backs
23.04.23, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair, fair, never said I didn't like it though 😘
23.04.23, 08:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, how was your night? Going out for breakfast with my parents and uncle now 😊. What do you have planned!
23.04.23, 08:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *?
23.04.23, 09:47 - Niki: I fell asleep and woke up at 5 and went back to sleep again so okay I guess. How was your night? My planes are just to clean up a bit and then date night 😘. What about you any plans for the?
23.04.23, 09:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I ended up going to sleep at 2 and had to wake up at 8 😅
Hope the waking up didn't disturb your sleep too much. 
I'm doing breakfast, then watching the Basketmatch between Casper and Jasper, then some driving and of course datenight 😘
23.04.23, 09:54 - Niki: Yeah right the basketball Match totally forgot that hope you have fun there and drive save 😘
23.04.23, 10:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, I'll try! ❤️
23.04.23, 14:23 - Niki: How is your day going? How is/was the basketball game?
23.04.23, 15:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The basketball game was great! They're all very good actually and it was really nice to watch, very intense too because the score was evenly matched near the end. Casper ended up winning to everyone's surprise but also delight. Driving went... Uh... Had an argument with my parents mainly because my mom was sitting in the front so idk, not too great. How's your day going?
23.04.23, 15:07 - Niki: Nice game  happy for the underdog to win as allways. 
Why did you have the argument? Because you didn't want to get teach by your mom or you don't trust her to step in if something happens?
My day is going pretty nice did some university stuff started a new deck in mgt and now I am cooking lunch.
23.04.23, 15:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, always fan of the underdog, especially because they already lost 3 times from them before this. 
We mainly had an argument because my dad was the one giving directions and he was sitting in the back, and that normally would have been fine, but because my mom was in the front she would also say things that would contradict my dad and I just got so confused because of that that I kinda lashed out. Nothing too bad, but it was pretty noticeable because my driving style also became slightly more aggressive 😅
Your day sounds nice! What are you having for lunch?
23.04.23, 15:14 - Niki: Yeah get that if there is too much stuff going on in a car you can't focus on shit. It's really annoying and also  dangerous. Hope your mom didn't think it was only because of her.
23.04.23, 15:15 - Niki: I am going to send you a picture of my food when it's done
23.04.23, 15:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no, I was very clear it wasn't just my mom's fault, I was mostly mad at my dad 😅
23.04.23, 15:17 - Niki: Okay hope your dad gets the reason why you were mad
23.04.23, 15:24 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.04.23, 15:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We made up no worries, though my dad would never admit it when he's wrong... (Now we're on to the next argument, though I'm not involved now, it's about the renovations again 😅) (none of the arguments are really serious though, it's all just slight annoyances)
23.04.23, 15:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooohhh, that looks really good!
23.04.23, 15:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There might be a chef inside of you after all! 😘
23.04.23, 15:31 - Niki: Thanks it looks better in the picture. I am still learning hope you can teach me more 😘
23.04.23, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Always for you 😘
23.04.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When do you wanna start datenight?
23.04.23, 16:41 - Niki: 19/19:30 meeting up with somebody befor
23.04.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, just call me when you're ready then, I don't have anything to do for the rest of today anyway
23.04.23, 16:42 - Niki: Okay will do 😘
23.04.23, 19:15 - Niki: Sorry we were out long than I thought I would eat something and then call you. So 30 min mabye?
23.04.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah sure, I'm also making some food now, fits well for me too 😊
23.04.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just call me when you want
23.04.23, 19:38 - Niki: Okay I am ready. What about you?

23.04.23, 19:39 - Niki: No worrys eat in peace an then call me
23.04.23, 19:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know I really don't mind calling while I eat right? Unless you mind seeing me eat though, idk
23.04.23, 19:41 - Niki: Yeah I don't know what too do while you eat and I am weird 🥲
23.04.23, 19:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're adorable

23.04.23, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I still have to do my Duolingo... Will go to sleep after that 😅
23.04.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
23.04.23, 23:08 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
24.04.23, 08:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning 😘, how was your night?
24.04.23, 09:20 - Niki: Good morning 😘. My night was nice dreamed about you 🥰. How way your night?
24.04.23, 09:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty alright, I don't remember dreaming about you though 🥲 What was your dream about?
24.04.23, 09:23 - Niki: We went on a day in a restaurant and we saw alot of people we know in there.
24.04.23, 09:23 - Niki: *Day = Date
24.04.23, 09:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cute, sounds like a nice dream 🥰
24.04.23, 10:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love the BAP talks, we're talking about parenting now and 1 of the group thinks spanking your kid is good??
24.04.23, 10:34 - Niki: I guess that person grew up in a conservative household
24.04.23, 10:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're trying to tell him that what he's remembering from his dad spanking him is trauma
24.04.23, 10:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's very fucking interesting for sure
24.04.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guy is not getting it... Still convinced he'll spank his children... WHY
24.04.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going though?
24.04.23, 10:40 - Niki: Slowly getting ready for the day and doing some university work
24.04.23, 10:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://open.spotify.com/track/0KM2y796j63t5RHhvRUxld?si=a5e8855575754344
24.04.23, 10:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I read that and this song started playing in my mind :)
24.04.23, 11:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Somehow the conversation went to swords and weapons... I.. I don't even question this anymore
24.04.23, 11:02 - Niki: Love the conversation switch but I guess better than working on the BAP 😅. When is your supervisor coming today? (not BAP daddy because that's weird now that he is 27)
24.04.23, 11:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh… True. It is indeed weird as hell now 😅 No clue when he's gonna be here, but we're out of this room at 12:30 so I hope before then
24.04.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He was there before 12:30 so I got to go home early 🥳
24.04.23, 13:06 - Niki: Any plans for your free time?
24.04.23, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really free time, still gotta work on the BAP but at least it's at home 😊
24.04.23, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day?
24.04.23, 13:13 - Niki: Pretty good doing some procrastinat but it's okay. Making lunch now. And at 15:00 volleyball starts
24.04.23, 13:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, some procrastination can't be avoided. 
It starts at 15 already? I though it was later. Have fun! 😘
24.04.23, 13:16 - Niki: Yeah it was later but they move the time up a bit I don't know why though
24.04.23, 13:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh okay, you think it's better now?
24.04.23, 13:37 - Niki: It's okay I don't mind to much
24.04.23, 18:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was volleyball?
24.04.23, 18:06 - Niki: Was pretty nice some new people were there today. How did your BAP work go?
24.04.23, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice to meet new people. BAP went well, did 2 interviews today, was quite nice
24.04.23, 18:15 - Niki: Did they have more people you could interview?
24.04.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really, but then again, 1 of the interviews was cut short because they had to go to the store, I'm sending the questions over and I'm also going to ask if they know anyone else that would be up for an interview.
24.04.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going to dance class now. What are you up to?
24.04.23, 19:02 - Niki: Going shopping. Hope you have fun 😘
24.04.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hate Alex's parents...
24.04.23, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't really, but jesus fucking christ now both of them want to hire me for marketing related business...
24.04.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I fucking hate Alex.
24.04.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This child is trying to inflate my ego until it fucking floats to the moon or something idk, I can't handle it and I don't want it
24.04.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Making me cry and all that, fucking love the bitch but why did Alex make me cry on a random as fuck Monday??
24.04.23, 22:53 - Niki: What happens i need more information why did you cry? Should I be mad or jealous at her or happy?
24.04.23, 22:54 - Niki: What does her mom do that she needs you for business? Did she run a dinner?
24.04.23, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll start with the easy part... Ish? Alex and their mom are in Italy right now with a friend of the mom. The friend owns a couple of houses (man is rich) and wants to let her rent them out because right now he's only renting them out to other Italians but if she decides to go in business she can rent them out to other Europeans and take part of the profit margin. She'd need a website for that and some proper marketing = which she needs me for because for some reason Alex has been boasting my skills to her, god only knows why
24.04.23, 23:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no fucking clue what you should be jealous about, unless you wanna be my platonic soulmate or shit like that
24.04.23, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But basically Alex made me cry because for some reason child thought it was a great moment to tell me she looks up to me and I'm one of the reasons she tries to better herself and all that and I got slightly emotional over it
24.04.23, 23:01 - Niki: Okay nice sounds interesting. Yeah the jealousy part wasnt really thought trough 😅.
24.04.23, 23:02 - Niki: That's so sweet, cool and much more. I can't image hear something like this from a friend. I think it's one of the highest compilmants some one can get 😳
24.04.23, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It really is... hence why I was crying, also because it's pretty overwhelming to hear this from one of your best friends, someone you consider to be fully your equal, and then to find out they look up to you? It's... An interesting feeling. I don't know if I deserve it but I definitely appreciate it
24.04.23, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening going?
24.04.23, 23:05 - Niki: Not as good as yours it seems but it was nice played with almost everybody some games and now I get ready for bed because I need to finish some work tomorrow morning 😅
24.04.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad you had a good evening, too bad about the work though 😅 I hope it doesn't take you that much time tomorrow morning
24.04.23, 23:08 - Niki: I think it should be fine mabye a hour we will see
24.04.23, 23:35 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
24.04.23, 23:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤
24.04.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wish you were here (as always)
25.04.23, 08:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, I see you woke up around 6 again, I hope the rest of your night was good though 😘
25.04.23, 08:16 - Niki: Yeah my night was fine. How was your night? And how was dance classes yesterday?
25.04.23, 08:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Slept pretty well, dance class was fun last night, we started a new dance again 😊
25.04.23, 08:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want to go to work though, Jesus Christ I'm looking up against it so much today 😅
25.04.23, 08:28 - Niki: Well yeah you weren't there for 5 days at some point you need to. Go back 😅. Which song are you dancing now?
25.04.23, 08:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I know... I'm just done with this internship, wish it was over already but it's still another month 😅
25.04.23, 08:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No clue what the song is honestly, if we get the video I'll send it to you
25.04.23, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aeneas wants to call us tonight, idk if you have time?
25.04.23, 10:55 - Niki: Yeah sure
25.04.23, 10:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I'll let him know

25.04.23, 11:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's mensa? And sounds like an exhausting day, hope everything goes well 😘

25.04.23, 16:07 - Niki: Pretty nice doing some university stuff and chilling with Alex
25.04.23, 17:43 - Niki: How was your work today? Are you home?

25.04.23, 17:48 - Niki: What you do at work today? Get home savely 😘.
25.04.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Worked on the GDPR guidelines for Foodpairing, then had to get all the errors out of an article, nothing special. Sorry, I'm kind of in a bad mood right now if that shows in my messages know it's nothing personal 😅
25.04.23, 18:00 - Niki: No worrys. Kinda same got so much stuff to do and I am procrasting to much ahh 😤
25.04.23, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I still have an article to write for school, got a headache and all... Urg 😭
25.04.23, 18:56 - Niki: I need more time I will be 10 mins late I wrote Aeneas already sorry 😅
25.04.23, 18:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have to say, you have made me realise the stereotype of Germans always being early/on time are not true at all
25.04.23, 18:59 - Niki: i am trying thought 😅. In person i am on time normally
25.04.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know I know, don't worry, it was just a joke

25.04.23, 19:05 - Niki: Can you add me to the call
25.04.23, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom is funny. She asked what you guys have planned for the rest of tonight, I said you're meeting up with someone. My mom asked who, I said I didn't know and she then asked me if I was fine with that? As if I shouldn't be?
25.04.23, 20:40 - Niki: with Alex and Patrick if your mom wants to know
25.04.23, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfftt, thanks for letting her know 😂
25.04.23, 20:41 - Niki: I have my secrets 😋
25.04.23, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oho, you have your secrets? I am intrigued
25.04.23, 20:41 - Niki: not really
25.04.23, 20:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, don't really have secrets either, idk if you noticed but I tell you literally everything 😅 (maybe a bit too much sometimes, sorry for that)

26.04.23, 08:20 - Niki: Good morning my love how was your night?
26.04.23, 08:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon, my night was alright, nothing special. How was yours and what are your plans for today?
26.04.23, 10:32 - Niki: Just university later and now we "bake" Croissant. Tonight we wanted to go to the free food meet up. What are your plans for today?
26.04.23, 10:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh? Baking croissants? I need to see the result of this 😁
Hope the food is good at the free food meet up 😊

26.04.23, 10:43 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
26.04.23, 10:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oioi
26.04.23, 10:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doesn't look that shabby
26.04.23, 10:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is it crunchy?
26.04.23, 10:52 - Niki: Yeah there okay
26.04.23, 10:52 - Niki: The French ones where way better

26.04.23, 11:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I made the playlist with Dutch music we were talking about sometime ago

26.04.23, 11:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will probably still change a bunch of things but it's a start
26.04.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3a9W0Avas5GCghyCLk5jPk?si=yqiCIBoySDK1MMmP2_nEww&pt=5b6903b73478090e05a8e122bf74edbb
26.04.23, 11:42 - Niki: Yeah did the same a few days back it's not completely done but I think it's okay
26.04.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is probably a better link
26.04.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah same, we can still adapt it 😊
26.04.23, 11:42 - Niki: How is your day going?
26.04.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's actually pretty busy 😅, but interesting! How's your day going? You ate all the croissants?
26.04.23, 11:44 - Niki: Yeah we ate the all. My day is going okay. Hope it's not too much work. Hope you can relax sometime 😚
26.04.23, 11:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I'll relax at lunch I guess, have a bunch of things still to do. BUT, now I can enjoy some German music through it ;) <3
26.04.23, 11:54 - Niki: Your so cute 🫠. Hope the rest of you work day goes by fast 😘
26.04.23, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love 😘

26.04.23, 14:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh btw... Alex can't do DnD on Friday 🙄, but they're gonna talk to Jingwen about us playing without Alex
26.04.23, 14:49 - Niki: okay she is still in italy.
26.04.23, 14:50 - Niki: *?
26.04.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Getting back from Italy that evening apparently
26.04.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got off work, how's your day been so far?
26.04.23, 17:34 - Niki: Procrastination and a bit of university 🥲.
26.04.23, 17:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh honey... Procrastination is gonna kick your ass someday, ya know? 😅
26.04.23, 17:36 - Niki: I know 😓
26.04.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Better get to work then 😘
26.04.23, 17:37 - Niki: Yeah will do 😊
26.04.23, 18:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out it tickles when someone paints your armpits 😂
26.04.23, 18:31 - Niki: Wait paints xD
26.04.23, 18:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
26.04.23, 18:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, does make up
26.04.23, 18:33 - Niki: I love how concentration she is 😅. Hope the shoot goes well 😘
26.04.23, 18:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so too. When you going to the free food meet?
26.04.23, 18:35 - Niki: I don't think I will. Don't feel like it
26.04.23, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh? How come?
26.04.23, 18:37 - Niki: I don't know just my mood right now
26.04.23, 18:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
26.04.23, 18:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
26.04.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope it's a relaxing evening at home then 😘
26.04.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just for the record, you're okay? Just not feeling like going out?
26.04.23, 19:29 - Niki: Yeah no worrys I am good 🥰
26.04.23, 19:30 - Niki: Looks nice. Is there a message behind the shapes or just too look nice
26.04.23, 19:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay good 😊
26.04.23, 19:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's supposed to look nice, kind of also supposed to show how different things can look I guess? The actual pictures are much cooler 😁
26.04.23, 19:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So if you're not getting the free food, what are you eating for dinner?
26.04.23, 19:33 - Niki: Gone make Burger later
26.04.23, 19:35 - Niki: Your done or still at it?
Same position as last time? You got more into the modeling thing?
26.04.23, 19:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds good, we're having leftover lasagna
26.04.23, 19:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm done, my dad too, now it's just my mom getting photographed. I wouldn't say I got more into it but the theme is kinda fun, so I definitely don't hate it 😊
26.04.23, 20:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So what are you doing tonight?
26.04.23, 20:04 - Niki: Playing last of us 2 with alex and killian probaly.
26.04.23, 20:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Photoshoot is over already, was really funny to watch
26.04.23, 20:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now Cato is gonna torture their mom, who has been on a diet the last couple of months, by putting chocolate sauce on her armpit 😂
26.04.23, 20:09 - Niki: xD
26.04.23, 20:09 - Niki: Their mom ?
26.04.23, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is the question about the mom or the use of 'their'?
26.04.23, 20:10 - Niki: use of their
26.04.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, Cato is non-binary so that's why
26.04.23, 20:11 - Niki: ahh okay
26.04.23, 20:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna eat now, god knows what after that
26.04.23, 20:12 - Niki: Hope you have a fun night 😘
26.04.23, 20:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, probably will be pretty boring though 😅
Hope you have a fun night too 😘
26.04.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am fucking annoyed that I keep thinking of you, you know that?
26.04.23, 21:44 - Niki: Same 😓 but I kinda like
26.04.23, 21:44 - Niki: It
26.04.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would like it better if I got to think about you while you're with me. Not when I'm watching a series with my parents and the smallest fucking thing reminds me of you and makes me... Idk, annoyed and sad?
26.04.23, 21:48 - Niki: Hope you can think of somethink else 🥰
26.04.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... you bastard
26.04.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're just laughing at me now
26.04.23, 21:48 - Niki: I don't mean it in a bad way sorry
26.04.23, 21:48 - Niki: No i swear
26.04.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... 😭 Boy
26.04.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
26.04.23, 21:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I need to find a way to make you understand when I'm being sarcastic over text, I see that now, sorry
26.04.23, 21:49 - Niki: I just wanna help but there is no good solution
26.04.23, 21:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, we've talked about this, there isn't necessarily a need for a solution with everything I complain about. In this case I know for a fact that there is a solution that works for me, but we can talk about it some other time, like on a call or something. There's no need for a quick fix. Also me sending you these kinds of messages is my way of saying I miss you 😅
26.04.23, 21:55 - Niki: Okay I am hard on the up keep. 😅
26.04.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean with that?
26.04.23, 22:01 - Niki: I slow on getting what you mean.
26.04.23, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe a little bit but then again I think we just communicate better when we're actually talking than when we're texting. Not gonna lie, our texting styles are kinda not really that compatible. It just makes it a little harder to understand
26.04.23, 22:05 - Niki: Yeah but I also just read it with out thinking
26.04.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, yeah, that can also happen 😂
26.04.23, 22:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute
26.04.23, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I want to say something else but I'm gonna wait until we call because I don't want it to be misunderstood through text (mainly because I don't know how to properly explain it)
26.04.23, 22:12 - Niki: Okay get that
26.04.23, 22:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're gaming with your friends now?
26.04.23, 22:20 - Niki: Yeah but we are swapping every time somebody dies
26.04.23, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which happens often or not? Also hope they're not annoyed you're texting me the whole time then 😅
26.04.23, 22:23 - Niki: Nah it's fine. They would tell me
26.04.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
26.04.23, 22:24 - Niki: Yeah we some time died often
26.04.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: As long as it's fun
26.04.23, 22:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My parents and I are just all on the couch, on our phones, in dead silence, there is 1 candle burning to give us some light... 😅 It's... A vibe?
26.04.23, 22:30 - Niki: This generation 😤😅. But nice
26.04.23, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind, the silence was broken, my dad won the online Scrabble game they were playing (apparently) and now my mom is mad and going to sleep
26.04.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna ask you 1 question and then I'm going to sleep. 100% blunt honestly please, do you or do you not like calling and why?
26.04.23, 22:58 - Niki: It a mix I like it because I can see and talk too you. But I also feel sad afterwards and I don't know what to do or to say I don't know. I want to call more but I feel weird while doing it.
26.04.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay. Is there anything I can do to make you feel less awkward during our calls? I honestly really don't understand what you mean though, because I never feel you're doing anything weird? You're just being your lovely self. Is it something I do that makes you feel weird about it? I get that it's a mix of emotions. I told you before, I really don't mind if we call and it's just quiet on both ends while we both do different shit, but I get if that makes you feel weird. Quite frankly I'd love to call more, and I would also like it if you initiated a call sometimes, but I get that might not be so easy if you feel weird about it.
26.04.23, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also told myself we wouldn't have this conversation tonight but whelp fuck it here it is I guess

28.04.23, 15:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will explain it when we call (whenever that may be) because it's way too complicated to send over text 😅 would send you screenshots but it's in Dutch so no can do

28.04.23, 18:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's much less worse than I thought... Jinte just sucks at telling the whole story

30.04.23, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now I'm gonna take a damn shower 😅
30.04.23, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me know your thoughts
30.04.23, 21:45 - Niki: Yeah sure we can drive too Lille no worries
30.04.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oki, but to plan things, you know when you'll be here yet? Was is the 17th or 18th?
30.04.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
30.04.23, 21:47 - Niki: On the 17 in the evening
30.04.23, 21:47 - Niki: Well the homies are okay
30.04.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooohhh, nice, that's earlier than I expected 😁🥳
30.04.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes of course, though Jinte seems to take that too literal sometimes... Weird kid, very weird kid. Was very respectful in bed though, no wandering hands
30.04.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I expect to see pictures of the happy couple on their date though
30.04.23, 21:49 - Niki: No wandering Hands 😅. Yeah for sure
30.04.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... when we sleep together we don't like to be touched so we stay very strictly on our sides of the bed (which somehow are predetermined, I'm always on the right...?) It's quite funny
30.04.23, 21:51 - Niki: xD
30.04.23, 21:51 - Niki: Sounds like a good Christian couple
30.04.23, 21:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Much more Christian than a certain other couple I can think of... 😘
30.04.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, not Christian at all, feeling like taking a hike right now, or at least reading a book... Boy... You're a menace for being stuck in my brain all day long
30.04.23, 23:12 - Niki: Well I would like too be there too but oh well 700 km between us are ij the way
30.04.23, 23:12 - Niki: *in
30.04.23, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sadly aware of that
30.04.23, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then again... Just a bit more than 2 weeks 😁🥲
30.04.23, 23:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It just feels like it's been longer, but I only saw you 2 weeks ago... So hard to believe
30.04.23, 23:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're still watching the tournament? Did you eat something?
30.04.23, 23:15 - Niki: Didn't eat something and I am done watching the tournament. You wanna call?
30.04.23, 23:15 - Niki: Yeah same it's been so long
30.04.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... you should eat
30.04.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would call, but I think you should eat
30.04.23, 23:16 - Niki: Then I am gone make somethink too eat now
30.04.23, 23:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good 😊
30.04.23, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you still wanna call after let me know, but eating and sleeping definitely goes first if you ask me, your health is important to me
30.04.23, 23:57 - Niki: Ate something but i am really tired now. Wanna call tomorrow if you have time?
30.04.23, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing hon, like I said, your health goes first always 😘
30.04.23, 23:58 - Niki: Goodnight my love ❤️

01.05.23, 10:39 - Niki: My night was pretty nice  even though i slept with clothe again. But you have a free day? Gone work on your BAP?
My plan for Today is not to procrastinat. So yeah just university stuff 😅
01.05.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey... Please for the love of God take care of yourself 😭
Yeah, it's an international holiday so everyone has a day off, my parents included. I'm not gonna bother with the BAP today, maybe I'll transcribe a little bit of the conversation I had last week but we'll see if I have time for that. Might use it to get away from the guests, but doubt it. 
Good luck with your plan, definitely let me know how that goes! I hope you get a lot of work done 😘
01.05.23, 10:44 - Niki: Yeah will let you know got want I get done. If you want we can also call later

01.05.23, 16:06 - Niki: I am procrasting right now will get back too it
01.05.23, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am so white that I sat outside in a little sunlight for 2 hours and now I'm sunburned... 🙃
01.05.23, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going?
01.05.23, 17:53 - Niki: Alex and Killian are back and I did some work
01.05.23, 17:53 - Niki: Hope the sunburn is in a okay spot
01.05.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My chest and probably face but that's not too bad. You're still gonna work today or gonna hang out with Alex and Killian?
01.05.23, 17:56 - Niki: I still need to do the some of the work but will do it later
01.05.23, 18:56 - Niki: Okay we going out to eat now. Love our planing
01.05.23, 18:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun, I hope the food is good. I kinda like the spontaneity of you and your friends, sounds freeing, not having to plan things always
01.05.23, 18:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm at dance waiting for the class to start... Both my parents are here for some reason... 😅🙃
01.05.23, 21:02 - Niki: Sounds nice that your parents support you. Yeah we did the think with the phones. The first person to look at there needs to pay. But nobody did 😅.
01.05.23, 21:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's nice, but I'm not used to anyone watching me dance so that was kinda weird 😅
All of you have good restraint from digital devices then, you all payed for yourselves?
We're watching the world finals of snooker, somehow there's a Belgian finalist. Are you going home now or doing something else?
01.05.23, 21:05 - Niki: Yeah we paid for our self and on our way home. Do you know how snooker works? Because we played it once big table with the points and had no idea 😅
01.05.23, 21:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't know before but it's pretty clear when you're watching it, should be able to explain it pretty easily
01.05.23, 21:08 - Niki: Okay mabye if we go play someday
01.05.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing 😊
01.05.23, 21:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got Cato's pictures from last week, they're pretty cool

01.05.23, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, gonna have to redo it though, no clue what it will look like next time
01.05.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cato wants to take pictures in the park 😅
01.05.23, 21:23 - Niki: You gone do them in the park. What's your opinion?
01.05.23, 21:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... I'm okay with taking pictures in private, not so much a fan of doing that in public 🙃
01.05.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But we'll see I guess
01.05.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Plans can still change
01.05.23, 21:24 - Niki: Okay yeah I would think about it twice.
01.05.23, 21:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, I'm up for it, just not that big of a fan. Quite frankly I'd do worse things as a favour for family or friends
01.05.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not me getting ready to go to sleep while my cousin asks me for clothing advice... She hasn't even noticed I was brushing my teeth or the fact that I'm in bed now 😂
01.05.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening going?
01.05.23, 22:39 - Niki: I am in my bed read to sleep as soon as I but my phone down
01.05.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honestly same, the moment this call ends I'm gonna go to sleep
01.05.23, 22:39 - Niki: Goodnight my love ❤️
01.05.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight honey ❤️
01.05.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sweet dreams
01.05.23, 22:40 - Niki: You too 😘
02.05.23, 08:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning hon, how was your night?
02.05.23, 08:17 - Niki: Night was good woke up at 6 and been doing some work that I didn't finish yesterday. How was your night?
02.05.23, 08:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goddamn, that's pretty fucking productive! Had a nightmare, so my night was kinda shit, but it's alright
02.05.23, 08:19 - Niki: What was the nightmare about if you wanna talk about? Hope your day gets better 😘
02.05.23, 08:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically I was meeting up with a friend (not anyone I actually know) and it was quite far, had to take a train, so I get there, we're hanging out and it's all fine but then at some point we're in his car and he just randomly starts jerking off. I'm completely shocked, obviously, and don't know what to do so at first I try to ignore it. But he's just... Going for it while I'm right next to him so I kinda make a noise to remind him of it. He... Uhm.. finishes and I'm just like... What the fuck dude I'm out of here I'm going home what the hell. So I get out of the car and he follows me "common give me a goodbye kiss" obviously I'm not going for that and I run away to the train station. Send you a message to ask if you can call but you say your grandma is in the hospital so it doesn't fit and then I think "well, I don't wanna bother him about this shit" and that's kinda where it ends. 
I hope you have a lovely day too 😘
02.05.23, 08:43 - Niki: Okay that's weird but yeah I guess dreams. But if you ever need to call me because something weird or creepy happend just. Write me that we need to call and I will pick up
02.05.23, 09:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, dreams are weird, kinda know where this one is coming from though. The whole Lars and Jinte thing may have something to do with it idk. 
Okay, I'll remember that, you're sweet 😘
02.05.23, 09:21 - Niki: Well hope the jinte and Lars think will be over soon / forgotten
02.05.23, 09:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, same, guess we'll see
02.05.23, 13:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
02.05.23, 13:02 - Niki: Will write u in 10 min or so
02.05.23, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can write me in an hour too ya know? No pressure 😘
02.05.23, 13:35 - Niki: Yeah my day is pretty nice. Had my first class at 9:45 then went to library did some work. After that Alex came to university and we ate at the mensa so now we are just sitting in the library and relaxing until the next classes starts at 15:45
02.05.23, 13:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds pretty chill
02.05.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I told Aeneas if he wants to do anything with you on Friday he has to talk to you, but I am kindly asking you to keep the evening free, we're going on a date
02.05.23, 16:59 - Niki: Okay 🥰 will keep that in mind
02.05.23, 18:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Datenight might be a bit later Thursday, gotta go driving and bake pancakes first, but I'll try to be quick 😅
02.05.23, 18:23 - Niki: Okay 😘
02.05.23, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love seeing you laugh and smile, it always pretty much makes my day 😘
02.05.23, 20:28 - Niki: Ahh your so cute 🫠

02.05.23, 20:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too 🫠❤️
02.05.23, 21:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're gonna eat after this?
02.05.23, 21:07 - Niki: No actually I ate before
02.05.23, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, nice! I like to hear that 😊
02.05.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cute, sexy and smart: Anthony 😂
02.05.23, 21:28 - Niki: Yeah I though so too
02.05.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know, I saw it on your face 😁
02.05.23, 21:31 - Niki: Hah🤭
02.05.23, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What did you think of the session?
02.05.23, 22:27 - Niki: I wanted to ask the same think right now xD
02.05.23, 22:28 - Niki: Yeah was really nice. Felt like Aeneas and you didn't have much to talk about but I guess it's hard for the DM to juggle some may people.
02.05.23, 22:28 - Niki: What are you and Alex are talking about?
02.05.23, 22:29 - Niki: *1 are to much
02.05.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I asked Aeneas if he was okay because he was so quiet, he said he was fine. I didn't mind not talking too much today, was nice to listen, I feel like I talk too much on other sessions anyway, was a nice change
02.05.23, 22:39 - Niki: Hope he is really fine
02.05.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Their trip to Italy and some friends we have, a party Alex is going to, all that
02.05.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You see we're still in the call on discord maybe?
02.05.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, me too... I'm planning on staying up until 12 to send him a birthday message, even if he says he doesn't care about it, I think it's a good day to see who cares about you
02.05.23, 22:41 - Niki: Yeah saw you on dc
02.05.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Insurance issues, gotta love that
02.05.23, 22:44 - Niki: Well I guess happens to everybody
02.05.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It sure does
02.05.23, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you think an internship counts as training or as job experience?
02.05.23, 23:23 - Niki: Yours as job experience but some are more training like if there only for a few weeks
02.05.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair point
02.05.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm applying for a couple more vacation jobs, so I'm changing up my resume a bit
02.05.23, 23:46 - Niki: Yeah kinda I tered to see your resume
02.05.23, 23:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can send it to you if you want but it's not at all interesting in my opinion, has a bunch of useless things on it too 😅
02.05.23, 23:50 - Niki: Yeah would love to
02.05.23, 23:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay sure
02.05.23, 23:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.05.23, 23:52 - Niki: The pacing is abit fuck but looks nice
02.05.23, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I usually use another one, wait, I have it here
02.05.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.05.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's your resume like?
02.05.23, 23:55 - Niki: Wait let me search it up
02.05.23, 23:55 - Niki: But looks nice
02.05.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it does the job I guess
02.05.23, 23:56 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.05.23, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Looks really good, definitely has a lot more personality than my resume does
02.05.23, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I like it
02.05.23, 23:58 - Niki: Yeah it's okay abit weird with just one project but well
02.05.23, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, maybe, you want to add more? I feel like the projects thing is more of a portfolio than something that should be on your resume, but then again I haven't looked into resumes for software developers so I could 100% be wrong
02.05.23, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I probably am wrong
03.05.23, 00:00 - Niki: Yeah no your right I am just to lazy for a portfolio I need to make it
03.05.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Making a portfolio sucks though, had to do it twice now and it is fucking hell, but yeah, probably should make one
03.05.23, 00:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... Aeneas is officially 23 now
03.05.23, 00:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤
03.05.23, 00:28 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
03.05.23, 08:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning how was your night?
03.05.23, 08:39 - Niki: Good morning my love my night was good. How wS your night?
03.05.23, 08:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was quite alright, what is on your planning for today?
03.05.23, 09:00 - Niki: Learning mostly what about you any plans after work?
03.05.23, 09:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just doing the armpit photoshoot for Cato again, don't think there's anything else
03.05.23, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out there was (or still is) asbestos on the outside of our house... Fucking great 😃👍
03.05.23, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
03.05.23, 11:52 - Niki: Going great gone make some lunch soon. How is your day going what are your task at work right now?
03.05.23, 11:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm answering more questions for journalists, I'll also be taking over some tasks from Elisa so I know what I'm doing when she's gone. Do you still have class today?
03.05.23, 11:54 - Niki: Yeah one at 14:00 but now I just work on some projects
03.05.23, 11:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice
03.05.23, 16:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going?
03.05.23, 16:13 - Niki: Relaxing right now. How is your day going?
03.05.23, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Stressful but alright I guess?
03.05.23, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know why it's stressful honestly, I'm just perceiving it as such
03.05.23, 16:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Relaxing sounds nice, I'm jealous 🥲
03.05.23, 16:16 - Niki: I will relax for you too 😅. Your doing the Dutch interview questions?
03.05.23, 16:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon, hope you relax a lot then 😘
Yuppp, have to answer questions about the science behind our business... I do not know the science 🙃
03.05.23, 16:17 - Niki: What are some of the questions mabye ask a coworker?
03.05.23, 16:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no, the question is literally: what is the science behind what you do... And like... I can give a very small explanation but that's about it, I don't understand shit about the chemistry behind it
03.05.23, 16:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could probably ask a coworker but everyone is gone now for some unknown reason
03.05.23, 16:20 - Niki: Well if nobody is watching does one need to really work?
03.05.23, 16:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yes because I have other shit on my to-do list as well D:
03.05.23, 16:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My shoulders are tense as fuck though, would love to take a walk and relax a little damn, it's also really good weather outside, I'm sad
03.05.23, 16:26 - Niki: Well I guess it needs to wait until after work if you still have the energy.
03.05.23, 16:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah nah, I don't have time. I have to go to the store first and then Cato is there already so... I don't have any time to relax today :) (I also have to cook dinner)
03.05.23, 16:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will live though
03.05.23, 16:29 - Niki: I wish I could be of any help to take some stuff of your list 🥲
03.05.23, 16:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Believe it or not, chatting with you is kind of relaxing me right now, so you technically are helping :)
03.05.23, 16:40 - Niki: Nice glad that I am helping even just a little bit. By the way I gone take a walk with Alex now because of the nice weather.
03.05.23, 16:40 - Niki: And your idea of taking a walk inspired my too
03.05.23, 16:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're absolutely right, enjoy the walk <3
03.05.23, 16:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (still jealous though)
03.05.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't smile at my pain, you're mean 🥺
03.05.23, 17:04 - Niki: Sorry just the extra side note made me smile
03.05.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: … Why the fuck are you this cute, it should not be legal
03.05.23, 17:31 - Niki: Well your not one to talk
03.05.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.05.23, 17:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... Dude, stop attacking me what is this even
03.05.23, 17:33 - Niki: Get home save 😘
03.05.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll try
03.05.23, 17:33 - Niki: You are cuter so
03.05.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
03.05.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was the walk?
03.05.23, 18:00 - Niki: Was really nice
03.05.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad is perhaps forcing you to go watch football together with him
03.05.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm supposed to ask you if you'd want to with him
03.05.23, 18:43 - Niki: Well I would go with you too the football match but I am not sure if I would go alone
03.05.23, 18:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't go, I have to work at the tennisclub. His logic is that you can go with him because otherwise you'd be bored the whole evening
03.05.23, 18:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So you don't want to? I'll let him know
03.05.23, 18:46 - Niki: I could go with you to the tennis club? But yeah I would go too the football game with him
03.05.23, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can definitely go with me, but you can also go to the football match, whatever you want to do
03.05.23, 18:49 - Niki: Decisions are hard on one side I really wanna spend the most time with you on the other side your dad invite me so ahhh I need to decide. Well I think tennisclub i would like the most
03.05.23, 18:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I told him, he said he thinks you'll be very bored 😂
03.05.23, 18:53 - Niki: Yeah will see but probably 😅
03.05.23, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Most of the time it's not that busy so I'll be available to provide entertainment, no worries 😘
03.05.23, 19:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This whole thing is causing an argument 😂
03.05.23, 19:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom's latest quote "It's not because you had a hard day you can annoy everyone else"
03.05.23, 19:03 - Niki: I didn't mean to cause a argument. But keep me update
03.05.23, 19:03 - Niki: To you or your dad?
03.05.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad, no worries, all in good fun
03.05.23, 19:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no, it's not because of you, my dad is just pushing his point through because he wants to be annoying
03.05.23, 19:06 - Niki: Ah okay
03.05.23, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's working, but it's kinda funny
03.05.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Time to be photographed again
03.05.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should be a professional model by the end of this
03.05.23, 19:15 - Niki: Well good luck hope she doesn't need to do them again. Have fun 😘
03.05.23, 19:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same, apparently I get diamonds on my armpits today 😳
03.05.23, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
03.05.23, 19:18 - Niki: Crazy 😳. Nothing much just relaxing with Alex and Killian
03.05.23, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun 😘
03.05.23, 20:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.05.23, 20:57 - Niki: Yeah it looks so weird to see a not completely installed window
03.05.23, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... Probably stuck with it for at least another week
03.05.23, 21:23 - Niki: How was the photoshoot by the way?
03.05.23, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was nice, very funny to see my dad in my mom's tanktop
03.05.23, 21:26 - Niki: Can image that what are you up too now ?
03.05.23, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now we're doing stupid things with fire
03.05.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.05.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Waiting for our pizzas to arrive
03.05.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.05.23, 21:27 - Niki: Okay looks like your dad has it under controll
03.05.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah nah... Unless we do something extreme the wood doesn't want to burn
03.05.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.05.23, 21:28 - Niki: So its wet / moist
03.05.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably, shouldn't be but yeah
03.05.23, 21:29 - Niki: Love the cat and dog just walking around
03.05.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, pure chaos, it was great
03.05.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
03.05.23, 21:30 - Niki: Meat up with a few people on discord to talk a bit
03.05.23, 21:30 - Niki: *meet
03.05.23, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice, enjoy yourself 😊

04.05.23, 09:33 - Niki: My night was good. Need to wake up early for classes though. How is work going today?
04.05.23, 09:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh right, Thursdays are your busy days! Hope it's not too tiring 😘
Learning a lot of new stuff, I have to take over a whole segment for Elisa from next week on 😅
04.05.23, 10:00 - Niki: Damm hope it's not too stressful. Yeah classes are boring but well what can you do.
04.05.23, 10:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think today will be fine, everyone is feeling lazy because the weather is too good
04.05.23, 10:49 - Niki: Hope the weather gets better when your done with work
04.05.23, 10:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dude, the weather is already so good, I could have gone to work in a t shirt
04.05.23, 10:50 - Niki: Okay nevermind then
04.05.23, 10:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the weather in Germany?
04.05.23, 10:52 - Niki: It's okay 12C° out side and a bit sunny but also windy
04.05.23, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, that's like half the temperature it is here... It's gonna be 24C° today ^^'
04.05.23, 10:53 - Niki: Damm that's really nice. Gone go for a walk after work?
04.05.23, 10:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, straight home bake pancakes and then going driving, hopefully back in time for datenight 😊
04.05.23, 12:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just impressed or horrified some people by telling them about my smuggling history
04.05.23, 12:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
04.05.23, 13:02 - Niki: Day is going alright gone be in university for a while
04.05.23, 19:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll be on time after all
04.05.23, 19:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe just 5 minutes late
04.05.23, 19:56 - Niki: Nice i won't be though
04.05.23, 19:56 - Niki: Yeah sorry we started a game
04.05.23, 19:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What time then?
04.05.23, 19:58 - Niki: 10 min later
04.05.23, 20:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll eat something then
04.05.23, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Call me when you want
04.05.23, 21:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
04.05.23, 23:26 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
04.05.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️

05.05.23, 08:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing to complain about 😊
05.05.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
05.05.23, 13:34 - Niki: Yeah it's going okay didn't do much though 😅. How is your day going?
05.05.23, 13:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't you have class today? Better get started if you wanna get something done I guess? Or don't if you wanna relax :)Pretty good, took a long lunch break because of the potluck. Everyone's food was great!
05.05.23, 13:46 - Niki: Yeah gone get to it now. Yeah classes were called of today at 7. I woke up for "nothing" 😅. Nice what was the best somebody brought with them?
05.05.23, 13:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jesus, bit last minute to cancel but better late than never I guess. Uhm... really hard to say, Elisa made 3 types of tiramisu, Alexandra made these amazing potatoes with 2 types of sauce, then there was Dahl and Angelos made Fava spread (I'm taking some home because there was so much left) Oh, and Cyril made these great plantains, honestly impossible to choose which was best...
05.05.23, 18:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://kamelrechner.eu/en
05.05.23, 18:41 - Niki: 63 to 82
05.05.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 81
05.05.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How come it's 63 to 82?
05.05.23, 19:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think it's the right link though... My colleague was saying something about personality characteristics which is not what this is, then again, it's just funny to calculate how many camels someone is worth
05.05.23, 19:03 - Niki: Yeah I got your score first and then my score
05.05.23, 19:03 - Niki: But I didn't know your exact highed
05.05.23, 19:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ohhhh, damn, I'm only worth 62 camel's? Disappointing 😂
05.05.23, 19:04 - Niki: in the camel trading world sadly yeah
05.05.23, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same, I'm 170cm
05.05.23, 20:31 - Niki: Yeah I did 1,68 sorry 😅.

05.05.23, 20:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I did 184 for you I think
05.05.23, 20:42 - Niki: 1.80 i am small too
05.05.23, 20:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, not small
05.05.23, 20:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're watching darts at my uncle's place now. What are you up to?
05.05.23, 20:51 - Niki: Went to a mtg tournament

05.05.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's nice, just chatting, kinda tired though, gotta cycle back home later. We're watching a championship that takes place in Belgium. The 2023 Belgian Darts Open in Wieze 😅
05.05.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're still hanging out at the tournament?
05.05.23, 21:31 - Niki: Sucks that you need to cycle home but nice enjoy the time with your family. I am home now and I pretty tired but Fabian called me he got dump on a date. So I am probably going play some games with him until midnight or so 😮‍💨
05.05.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah shit... Hope he doesn't feel too bad about it, good luck staying awake, don't fall asleep in your clothes again 😘
05.05.23, 21:32 - Niki: Won't happen hopefully 😅
05.05.23, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hopefully so indeed
05.05.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Finally got home. I'm dead. How're you doing?

07.05.23, 12:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... That's what we thought the last 2 times so this time I'll just assume it will happen again next week 😂

07.05.23, 16:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon 😘, just got home. Did you go on the walk? And if so, how was it?
07.05.23, 16:49 - Niki: Yeah was on the walk but parts of the track were block off so it was way shorter then I thought only 30 min in the Ende.
07.05.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's too bad! Hope it was still nice
07.05.23, 16:50 - Niki: Yeah weather is great
07.05.23, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very different from Belgium then 😅
07.05.23, 16:51 - Niki: How is the weather in Belgium?
07.05.23, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Shitty as hell, it's raining a lot, not cold though
07.05.23, 16:52 - Niki: Okay sounds okayish what are you up too now?
07.05.23, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No clue, nothing planned. You?
07.05.23, 16:54 - Niki: Probably gone play some games will see
07.05.23, 16:59 - Niki: If you wanna too we can also call later? Making food right now
07.05.23, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, just wondering, is this lunch, a snack or dinner? 5 is such a random time 😅
07.05.23, 17:01 - Niki: Lunch 😅 yeah I am a bit late today.
07.05.23, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey... You're not just late today 😂
07.05.23, 18:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom is disappointed in me because I'm watching in her words "a misogynistic and brain-dead tv show" and well... She's not wrong but it's just funny to watch 😂
07.05.23, 18:01 - Niki: What TV show are you watching?
07.05.23, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, it was the only thing that seemed semi interesting on tv 😅
07.05.23, 18:04 - Niki: Okay never heard of it. But well is it really that misogynistic?
07.05.23, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, it's BAD, they're deciding on who should join the team and they're basically saying things like "too small, ugly butt, out" so yeah... But it's kinda interesting to see how easily the judges just completely ignore that the candidates are people too by just calling them by their numbers
07.05.23, 18:09 - Niki: Oh, yeah I think it's okay to watch. I don't think you get easily influenced
07.05.23, 18:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't get easily influenced, you're right about that, but that's not what my mom is worried about, she's just annoyed because I'm "too smart and feminist" to watch these kinds of things 😂
07.05.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
07.05.23, 18:28 - Niki: playing lol with my marco and Hirschi
07.05.23, 18:29 - Niki: they want to join the tournament I played yesterday
07.05.23, 18:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, cool! Is it happening again? Or is it a continuous thing?
07.05.23, 18:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They want you on their team as well?
07.05.23, 19:20 - Niki: yeah i joined them now
07.05.23, 19:46 - Niki: You up too call after there tournament? Probably around 22 maybe earlier?
07.05.23, 19:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, just let me know, but also if you don't feel up to it at that time just let me know 😘
Have fun & good luck with the tournament! 🍀
07.05.23, 22:19 - Niki: You still up?
07.05.23, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
07.05.23, 22:19 - Niki: Wanna call?
07.05.23, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure
07.05.23, 22:20 - Niki: Ready when you are
07.05.23, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same
07.05.23, 23:21 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
07.05.23, 23:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
08.05.23, 08:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, hope you had a good night 😘
08.05.23, 09:09 - Niki: Good morning my love 🥰, my night was good how was your night?
08.05.23, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a pretty good night, I hated getting out of bed though 😅
08.05.23, 14:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Purely out of curiosity, why did you stop calling me Lämmchen? (Or however you write it)
08.05.23, 14:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And how's your day going?
08.05.23, 14:32 - Niki: Gone write you after class 😘
08.05.23, 15:27 - Niki: I don't know why but I think because writing is weird. It's german and we write in English.
08.05.23, 15:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's very fair
08.05.23, 15:28 - Niki: Day is going great done with class now and volleyball is next. How is your day going my love 😘
08.05.23, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm happy you're having a good day, have fun at volleyball hon 😘! 
My day's going quite alright, had fries for lunch, Robin ate with us 😂, might take a nap
08.05.23, 15:31 - Niki: How did your BAP group thinks about the time you have left? Have a great nap 😘
08.05.23, 15:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, we're all worried because we only have a month left and only have 5 interviews done so far, but we talked to Robin and he calmed us down so I think it will be alright. Thanks love 😘
08.05.23, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In your opinion, is it better to work for school now I'm motivated or go to dance class?
08.05.23, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also how was volleyball?
08.05.23, 18:13 - Niki: School work if your motivation enough
08.05.23, 18:13 - Niki: Volleyball was pretty nice some new faces today.
08.05.23, 18:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess so, will probably be transcribing the interview tonight then
08.05.23, 18:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It seems like there's always new people, is it just people joining or also people just going whenever they want to?
08.05.23, 18:15 - Niki: Nice have a productive evening. I am tried and sweaty gone take a shower now
08.05.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a plan, will see, my mom might severely disagree with you though 😅
Enjoy the shower 😘
08.05.23, 18:30 - Niki: Yeah probably it's also important to take breaks and not think about work
08.05.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I know, but I think if I don't get it done now it will be more difficult in the next couple of weeks if we get more interviews that also need to be transcribed and then to write our whole thesis... better to have it done today.
08.05.23, 18:41 - Niki: Yeah good attitude. I think so too
08.05.23, 19:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well there goes my concentration 😅
08.05.23, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I lost your hair tie and I'm definitely not freaking out about it. I'm also too tired to go looking for it so I'm just gonna try to go to sleep.
08.05.23, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️
08.05.23, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is weird my wrist feels naked, but in a bad way
08.05.23, 22:59 - Niki: Goodnight
08.05.23, 22:59 - Niki: *❤️
09.05.23, 08:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found the hair tie 😊
How was your night?
09.05.23, 08:31 - Niki: My night was good but struggling with getting out of bed for the last 20 mins 😅. How was your night? Did you transcript the interview yesterday evening?
09.05.23, 08:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Getting out of bed sucks massively 🥲
Slept quite alright.
I started on it but it was a bit more than I expected so it isn't quite done yet. Also Alex called in the middle of it so I got distracted 😅
09.05.23, 08:35 - Niki: Got them Alex 😅. Well atleast you go some of it done
09.05.23, 08:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah.. well at least we managed to decide we're going to the DnD movie on Friday? And yeah, at least I got some part of it done
09.05.23, 08:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today? Just school or something else as well?
09.05.23, 08:55 - Niki: Just school and dnd tonight but yeah that's it
09.05.23, 08:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck at school then 😘

09.05.23, 14:18 - Niki: Well my day is pretty good too but it's all really relaxed 🤭. Hope it's not too busy and if it is atleast you can be hypt for ESC and dnd tonight
09.05.23, 14:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, no worries, it's busy but manageable so I'll be able to be excited tonight 😊
Glad your day is going well 😘
09.05.23, 15:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
09.05.23, 15:55 - Niki: I don't feel it that much but yeah could be
09.05.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently 1/3 of Germans should be flexitarian...
09.05.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have a hard time believing the statistics honestly
09.05.23, 15:57 - Niki: Yeah but it could be that it is in a different area more
09.05.23, 15:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could be yeah, but I'm checking the source now to be sure :) What are you up to?
09.05.23, 15:58 - Niki: Playing now some games with Marco and Killian wanted to play some basketball later we shall see.

10.05.23, 17:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss covid... Good times when people wouldn't get in your personal space at the supermarket
10.05.23, 17:51 - Niki: Yeah was really nice. Hope you get home savely 😘. 
How is your day going after work now? Anyplans for tonight?
10.05.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Only just no, going home, no promises on the getting home safely... Traffic is fucking insane today. Yeah, my cousin has to redo the armpit shoot and I have to cook, so I guess that's about it for my evening. Oh, and I have to send some more info to get a summer job. When does the festival start?
10.05.23, 18:01 - Niki: It already happening but  we gone go later.

10.05.23, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, okay, cool 😊
10.05.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I swear I've seen 4 cyclists being pretty much flattened by a car or buss... The fuck is going on today 🥲
10.05.23, 18:27 - Niki: Yeah would be actually nice to meet her.
10.05.23, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cato told me not to be surprised if they show up at the front door next week 😂
10.05.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the festival?
10.05.23, 22:51 - Niki: We are done now heading back home 😅 but was pretty nice
10.05.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What kind of festival was it actually? Music or food or something else? I'm happy to hear you had a good time :)
10.05.23, 22:53 - Niki: Mostly Rock and some punk Music. The food was shit just drank some beers with some friends there. How was your evening
10.05.23, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds cool 😎 the food being terrible shouldn't be a surprise anymore 😅
My evening was quite nice, my aunt and Pieter came over and made quiche. The photoshoot was done quickly too and I am now just sending out another email for a summer job :)
10.05.23, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also really wouldn't be surprised if Cato is actually here next Wednesday 😅... And my family might decide to go to the tennisclub on Saturday for drinks just to see you... Honestly it's impressive how they seem to like you so much (can't blame them though, I 100% agree you're amazing 😘)
10.05.23, 22:59 - Niki: Love too hear that 🥰
10.05.23, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's just 1 more week you do not know how excited I am

11.05.23, 00:07 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
11.05.23, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's like I always miss you more when I know I'll see you soon...
11.05.23, 00:30 - Niki: Yeah same i think it's a mix of euphoria of seeing you again and the feeling of know it's gone be too short
11.05.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's always gonna be too short 😅
But now I'm laying awake just thinking about you and it makes it worse, really wish I could hug you right now
11.05.23, 00:33 - Niki: 🫠Yeah I get the same feeling. Next week 😘
11.05.23, 00:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Next week 🥰😘
11.05.23, 00:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Before I forget (I suddenly think of it idk why) did you tell Alex I think he's your coolest friend now I saw his dog? And if so, what was his response? Don't have to answer right now if you wanna go to sleep, you have a busy day at uni tomorrow (if your schedule didn't change again and my memory serves me well)
11.05.23, 00:41 - Niki: Yeah told he was happy and told ole to suck it 😅. Yeah tomorrow is going to be awful but well what can one do
11.05.23, 07:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love that reaction 😂

11.05.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me know if you need some rest tonight okay? You're cute when you're sleepy, that's not the issue, but ya know, I'd rather you get some rest ❤️
My day's busy as hell, but quite alright.

11.05.23, 18:00 - Niki: Yeah no worries I just slept a bit 🥰

11.05.23, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently my parents told him (the banker guy) about you and that we're going to Berlin and he apparently loves Berlin so now he's gonna send me a bunch of recommendations
11.05.23, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love the guy, he's great
11.05.23, 18:42 - Niki: Sounds nice

11.05.23, 19:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Take your time
11.05.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know I told you to take your time but I miss you 😶 (that being said don't rush)
11.05.23, 22:17 - Niki: Yeah I miss you too. I thought about calling you while I make the food but I also don't want somebody to come in while I call with you. I don't know 🙃. But I will be done soon 5 more min or so

12.05.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning hon, hope you had a good night, hope your class is interesting 😘
12.05.23, 10:06 - Niki: Yeah my night was good. Hope you slept well too. Class will be boring but oh well it's fine
12.05.23, 10:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a weird dream, but slept fine other than that yeah. Good luck not falling asleep then ;)
12.05.23, 10:07 - Niki: What did you dream about?
12.05.23, 10:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically I got a job offer from my current internship place and then one of my teeth fell out... So yeah, weird
12.05.23, 10:09 - Niki: Mabye there is some deeper meaning behind the dream 😅
12.05.23, 10:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... if you can believe the shit people say when analysing dreams then teeth falling out means that you feel like you don't have control over your life, which isn't really true right now I think so I have no clue what it meant
12.05.23, 13:32 - Niki: How is your day going everything under control  😅
12.05.23, 13:33 - Niki: Alex, Patrick and me are going to a street food festival in Leipzig later and then hanging out probably some billiard and stuff.
12.05.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh.. well.. Slightly? got a shit ton to do, the video was from during lunch btw :)How's your day going?
12.05.23, 13:34 - Niki: Pretty good got some university stuff done so feeling good with going out now😅. Don't over work yourself and mabye push some task to Monday
12.05.23, 13:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, let me know how the food is 😊

12.05.23, 13:36 - Niki: Hope you get everything done then. You got this 😘

12.05.23, 13:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😘
12.05.23, 15:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm going fucking insane because of this one fucking journalist and honestly if I could strangle someone through the internet I fucking would

12.05.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad your afternoon is nice though 😘
12.05.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going home half an hour early because I can't deal with this shit anymore 🥲
12.05.23, 17:24 - Niki: Right decision. Get home savely 😘
12.05.23, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got home: more stress, talking about my driver's exam 🥲
12.05.23, 17:26 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
12.05.23, 17:27 - Niki: Hope that betters the mood

13.05.23, 10:08 - Niki: What was your dream about?
13.05.23, 10:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was kinda weird? You called me while I had to open the front door, but apparently you didn't call me, it was Lena and your mom because they wanted to show me an outfit or make up (idk) but I had to open the door so they were disappointed and after I opened the door they were gone already, but you were on the phone then, which was nice 😊
13.05.23, 10:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today?

14.05.23, 12:43 - Niki: Ah so cute 🥰
14.05.23, 13:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just made someone really happy by giving them mayonnaise... This job is weird 😂
14.05.23, 13:24 - Niki: xD yeah was it a kid ?
14.05.23, 13:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope
14.05.23, 13:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A guy in his twenties I think? He was complaining about mayonnaise with lemon and how much better it is with egg, so I went and got him the one with egg instead of the one with lemon I already gave him
14.05.23, 13:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cue the whole table laughing and him being really happy 😂
14.05.23, 13:26 - Niki: xD nice. His prayers where heard

14.05.23, 18:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, guess it went fine, my parents say so, kinda feel really fucking stressed about it though
14.05.23, 19:10 - Niki: You got this no worries. You just need to be calm and collected.
14.05.23, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
14.05.23, 19:12 - Niki: Alex and Killian are back and we are just relaxing now
14.05.23, 19:14 - Niki: You wanna call?
14.05.23, 19:14 - Niki: Or what are you up too?
14.05.23, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eating dinner now, wanna call in like half an hour?
14.05.23, 19:18 - Niki: Yeah sure
14.05.23, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (or after you eat dinner)
14.05.23, 19:24 - Niki: Then I will go and make myself some dinner. Will take a while
14.05.23, 19:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, let me know when you're done then
14.05.23, 20:04 - Niki: I am gone eat now so we can call in 10/20 mins
14.05.23, 20:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just call me when you're ready then
14.05.23, 20:05 - Niki: ok
14.05.23, 20:16 - Niki: I am done eating can I call?
14.05.23, 20:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
14.05.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I lied
14.05.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hate you
14.05.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why would you leave me???
14.05.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (just kidding)
14.05.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not gonna lie though, not entirely happy you left me 🥲
So abruptly, you're a mean mean man mister Grinch
14.05.23, 22:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (this is your own fault, you told me to text you when I overthink the exam so here we are)
14.05.23, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I should go to sleep soon because I am indeed tired as fuck, but the way you said goodbye including that factoid made me feel like I was somehow being sent to bed like a kid and I have an issue with authority telling me what to do with my own body so now I refuse to go to sleep soon
14.05.23, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You also look really cute when you're gaming btw
14.05.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But now I'm thinking about it I'm kind of annoyed that you went away to game considering you play 8-12 hours a week and while I don't keep count, I'm very sure we don't exactly call that much. Then again, you type really slow so it's possible texting amounts to that time, in that case I shouldn't be annoyed I guess. Do with this thought plan what you want I guess
14.05.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Actually nevermind
14.05.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretend you never read that
14.05.23, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I sound like a bitch telling you what to do with your time
14.05.23, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun playing games love 😘
14.05.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (for real, don't take anything I said seriously, I'm not in my right mind right now)
14.05.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Except for this, I fully meant this
14.05.23, 22:28 - Niki: Okay yeah I am sorry. I feel also really bad about won't do it again it's a shity feeling I have now 😅. Not because of the texts by the way. I just feel shit while playing.
14.05.23, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want you to feel like shit playing though 😭
I hope you still have a fun time even so
14.05.23, 22:30 - Niki: Also i love the wall of text by the way it's just really nice 😊.
14.05.23, 22:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't think anyone would like a wall of texts but sure, I'll remember that I guess 😅
14.05.23, 22:30 - Niki: And I am really slow at texting 😅
14.05.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, kinda, it's cute
14.05.23, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, since you replaced me with Marco 🙄 (jk) I guess I'll call Alex now 😂
14.05.23, 22:32 - Niki: I don't know why but reading all your messages is nice
14.05.23, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
14.05.23, 22:33 - Niki: Hope you have a nice call with Alex
14.05.23, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's good to know it doesn't annoy you when you see a shit ton of texts from me
14.05.23, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, have fun playing games 😘
14.05.23, 22:33 - Niki: No worries love that
14.05.23, 22:36 - Niki: And just say it again I feel shity and won't ever "replace" you again with Marco or any one else to play gamey
14.05.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 🥺 
Love you ❤️
14.05.23, 22:44 - Niki: Love you 🥹 ❤️
14.05.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
15.05.23, 00:10 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
15.05.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't sleep... I'm annoyed
15.05.23, 00:32 - Niki: Same wanna call
15.05.23, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Telling your mind and body that you need sleep and then not being able to it fucking stupid
15.05.23, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, but give me a minute
15.05.23, 00:33 - Niki: Okay
15.05.23, 00:33 - Niki: Yes but mind over body doesn't work sadly
15.05.23, 00:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: According to one of my friends it should
15.05.23, 00:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm ready
15.05.23, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning, I fell asleep really quickly after your phone died so thank you again for that 😘

15.05.23, 19:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And Aeneas asks when we'll be in Lille on Thursday, probably between 10/11 and 20 or something I guess?

15.05.23, 19:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's also so young?? Like, I think she's probably 30 now?

15.05.23, 19:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe yeah, you have a point
15.05.23, 21:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would you rather see Everything, Everywhere All At Once or an obscure documentary you've never heard of? Or neither?

16.05.23, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One of my colleagues because I said we have Mein Kampf at home. It was a joke, but still kinda interesting joke to make 😅 I thought it was funny though
16.05.23, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Boy, it's chocolate, I know you don't like chocolate 😅
But they should have other things there as well so I guess it should be good yeah
16.05.23, 13:11 - Niki: Yeah I would think so too it's just funny. Respons would be my parents have hammer and a sickle but there no comis
16.05.23, 13:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfffttt
16.05.23, 13:12 - Niki: Yeah I probably won't like the chocolate but it looks good.
16.05.23, 13:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, it's also a bakery so I think you should be able to get something nice too
16.05.23, 13:14 - Niki: Yeah for sure
16.05.23, 13:15 - Niki: How is your day going
16.05.23, 13:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's going pretty well, my mentor is on a holiday until Friday so I'm just doing the tasks she put out for me to do. Pretty chill. How's your day going?
16.05.23, 13:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I also may or may not have wanted to visit one of Fazer's shops for a couple of years now, don't ask me why)
16.05.23, 13:19 - Niki: Same pretty chill in the cafeteria now and eating  lunch. Yeah I am getting more and more excited about the trip to Finland
16.05.23, 13:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Me too :)How's the food today?
16.05.23, 13:24 - Niki: Food is okayish but it's cheap so pretty good.
16.05.23, 13:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, okayish is better than bad I guess? And yeah, cheap food always better
16.05.23, 13:46 - Niki: Yeah going to a lecture of Alex now because I miss read the time we have classes
16.05.23, 13:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... Hope it's interesting
16.05.23, 13:52 - Niki: Yeah it's about LaTeX it's a text mark up language. It's usefull but really hard to get into if not interesting
16.05.23, 13:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough, might look it up to see what it's about just because I can
16.05.23, 13:54 - Niki: sure
16.05.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've gone to buy Aeneas a present but now I found a pillow I want to buy for myself... Screw fluffy things, I'm such a sucker for them 😭
16.05.23, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On the positive side, I found a great present for Aeneas 😊
16.05.23, 17:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was Alex's class?
16.05.23, 17:44 - Niki: Nice did you buy the pillow and what did you get him?
Yeah Alex class was boring but yeah learn some stuff about sage and latex.
16.05.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't buy the pillow, it was 30 euros and didn't fit in my bag
16.05.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I got him Crazy Cat Dude socks and Cat Jokes
16.05.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least you learnt something?
16.05.23, 18:03 - Niki: Yeah learned a bit. Nice presents pretty sure he will love it 🥰
16.05.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so, almost went to world's end and bought a MTG deck but then realised I have no clue what I'm looking at so if you don't mind we can do that together if we find some time?
16.05.23, 18:07 - Niki: Yeah sure I would love too if thought I also have no idea but we can guess together 😘
16.05.23, 18:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Lovely, sounds like a plan 😂😘
16.05.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just to have an idea, but what time do you think you'll be here tomorrow?
16.05.23, 18:29 - Niki: around 18 maybe a bit earlier don't know for sure
16.05.23, 18:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, sounds good. I should be home around the same time. Hope you don't get stuck in traffic around Antwerp again 😅
16.05.23, 19:46 - Niki: What are you up tonight?
16.05.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cleaning my room a little, nothing else. What are you doing?
16.05.23, 19:53 - Niki: Cooking now and else chilling with Alex and Killian
16.05.23, 20:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice, what's for dinner?
16.05.23, 20:09 - Niki: Just pasta
16.05.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't know what else I expected by asking that honestly 😅
16.05.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So fun fact... The socks I got Aeneas today? Apparently my dad has them too and he was wearing them today 😂😅
16.05.23, 23:01 - Niki: Another piece of clothing they have in common
16.05.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, guess so 😅
16.05.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm accidentally turning Aeneas into my dad... Why and how even?
16.05.23, 23:03 - Niki: I am going to sleep now
16.05.23, 23:04 - Niki: Well I guess he got a similar vibe to him 😅
16.05.23, 23:04 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
16.05.23, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️
16.05.23, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't wait for tomorrow 😘
16.05.23, 23:04 - Niki: Same love you 😘
16.05.23, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too 😘
17.05.23, 09:08 - Niki: Good morning my love hope your night was good 😘
17.05.23, 09:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning love, hope you had a good night too, I slept really well 😘
17.05.23, 09:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me know when you leave? And I know you're not gonna listen to me but still, drive safe, take a couple of breaks (this is the part where I know you won't listen but it's fine, I accept your flaws)
17.05.23, 09:27 - Niki: Will take some beaks for you and yeah probably around 10:30~11:00
17.05.23, 09:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, not gonna lie, you're 100% gonna end up in a traffic jam around that time but I really hope  you don't 😅
17.05.23, 09:31 - Niki: Yeah well it's gonna happen 😅
17.05.23, 09:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely, I call it now, you're gonna be stuck around Antwerp for an hour and then half an hour at least around Ghent
17.05.23, 09:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope I'm wrong... But I fear for it
17.05.23, 10:23 - Niki: I am packing my stuff now so 20 till I start
17.05.23, 10:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I'll be counting down the minutes until I get to go home 😅
17.05.23, 12:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Boy, aren't you driving? Eyes on the road sir
17.05.23, 12:21 - Niki: I taking a break right now😅
17.05.23, 12:22 - Niki: Having "breakfast" right now
17.05.23, 12:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, if it's longer than an hour after waking up that's called brunch ;)
17.05.23, 12:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you eating?
17.05.23, 12:28 - Niki: Honey rice Waffel
17.05.23, 12:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very nice
17.05.23, 14:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Time goes so slow today 😭... And there's no one at the office + nothing interesting to do... I'm literally just counting down until I get to leave 😂
17.05.23, 14:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope your drive is going well 😘
17.05.23, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm going homeeeee
Still hope your drive is going well ❤️
17.05.23, 17:58 - Niki: Yeah going well some traffic js here and there
17.05.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So how far are you still?
17.05.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad traffic hasn't been too bad yet, the news says something else 😅
17.05.23, 18:02 - Niki: 100 km away around 1, 1/2 hour
17.05.23, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okido, so you still have to pass by Antwerp 😅 
Good luck 😘
17.05.23, 19:44 - Niki: Final trough Antwerp 20 min till gent 🥳
17.05.23, 19:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We shall see, but happy you're through Antwerp! 🥳
17.05.23, 20:02 - Niki: Gone Park my car under the bridge
17.05.23, 20:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, want me to come over there?
17.05.23, 20:06 - Niki: Yeah
17.05.23, 20:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, on my way
20.05.23, 13:59 - Niki: 21.08.2023 Start of Finnland Trip - 04/05.09.2023
21.05.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
21.05.23, 17:58 - Niki: Love you ❤️
21.05.23, 18:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too, don't text and drive 😘
21.05.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I remember, the child version to say chocolate croissant is chocolatine 😊
21.05.23, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was gonna stay awake until you get home, but I'm afraid I will fall asleep before then even if I want to stay awake.
21.05.23, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I hope you have a nice and safe drive still, and then a good night sleep once you get home 😘
21.05.23, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love, I don't like sleeping without you already ❤️
21.05.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I know why the condoms break
21.05.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will explain later, going back to trying to fall asleep now
22.05.23, 02:49 - Niki: Savely at home will respond and read the texts tomorrow good night Hon ❤️
22.05.23, 08:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon, hope you had/have a good night rest. I'm at school now, kind of a fancy place today 😊
22.05.23, 08:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
22.05.23, 09:29 - Niki: Good morning my love 🥰
Yeah looks really great
22.05.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You just woke up? (I hope you did, though that also means you missed your class)
22.05.23, 09:46 - Niki: Yeah but it's okay just slept through the alarm 😅
22.05.23, 09:47 - Niki: By the way your message while I was driving are really cute 😘
22.05.23, 09:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're feeling kinda rested? You only got home around 3...
 though I have to say I finally fell asleep in a good way after reading your message 😅
22.05.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know there's 1 thing I said I would never do and I did it and now I feel stupid.
22.05.23, 11:12 - Niki: Wait what do mean?
22.05.23, 11:13 - Niki: Kinda mad that you stay awake until 3 but also really cute of you 😘
22.05.23, 11:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If it makes you feel better, I actually didn't stay awake until then, but I woke up a bunch of times and had a nightmare before waking up to read your message. After that I could finally go to sleep peacefully 😅
I was planning on staying awake though, but I was also dead tired and falling asleep by myself, which never happens normally. I guess not having you around is exhausting to me 😘
22.05.23, 11:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm going to the dentist today... And I heard dentists can see when you performed fellatio on someone... So I fucking hope my dentist doesn't see the back of my throat bruised (doesn't feel like it but idk) because the guy has known me since I was a baby 😅
22.05.23, 11:17 - Niki: Yeah he is gone see I think. But I hope not for you 😅
22.05.23, 11:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
22.05.23, 11:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will die of embarrassment if he says anything about it
22.05.23, 11:19 - Niki: Yeah I would so too 😅
22.05.23, 11:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also my mom did not have the talk with me and they're leaving today so either she's just gonna ignore it, didn't see it at all or we're postponing it idk
22.05.23, 11:32 - Niki: Well yeah she also has alot todo soo
22.05.23, 11:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, but there was a moment when it was possible yesterday but it didn't happen so yeah. What are you up to today?
22.05.23, 11:55 - Niki: Just university stuff and household chores. Oh yeah my bear deck came so sorting that.
22.05.23, 12:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh cool! Send me a few pictures?
22.05.23, 12:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also just found out when my graduation ceremony is gonna be... Fucking weird how close it's getting
22.05.23, 12:27 - Niki: Yeah well your soon done and then masters 🥳
22.05.23, 12:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but it's the 30th of September, which is already in the new semester
22.05.23, 12:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yeah, probably gonna go
22.05.23, 12:32 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

22.05.23, 12:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They looks really nice
22.05.23, 12:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The Japanese card is really funny though 😂
22.05.23, 12:36 - Niki: Yeah got the english card allways on my phone as a chrome tap xD
22.05.23, 12:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's very smart 😂
22.05.23, 13:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Might get a plan B after all, just to be sure
22.05.23, 14:26 - Niki: Okay sounds good hope the effect of the plan b isn't too strong on you
22.05.23, 14:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Getting the thing was fucking awful
22.05.23, 14:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Worse than in Germany 😅
22.05.23, 14:52 - Niki: ? tell me what happend
22.05.23, 14:52 - Niki: It was reallly awake in germany already
22.05.23, 14:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There was a student pharmacist and an older one explaining and they were talking for 5 minutes about the best thing for me
22.05.23, 14:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And they asked some questions, it was so awkward 😅
22.05.23, 14:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also feel like the older lady was judging me when I said I wasn't on normal birth control
22.05.23, 14:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also it's on my ID now... But it was cheaper
22.05.23, 14:53 - Niki: Well atleast you got good consulting
22.05.23, 14:53 - Niki: How is it on your ID?
22.05.23, 14:54 - Niki: Yeah I think if you go alone people judge more
22.05.23, 14:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfftt... I guess so? Apparently in Belgium they have multiple pills and depending on the situation they prescribe different ones
22.05.23, 14:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably
22.05.23, 14:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's on prescription
22.05.23, 14:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can also get it anonymously but it's cheaper on prescription or something
22.05.23, 14:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's half the price when on prescription so I thought it would be alright, only my doctor and I can see that info anyway
22.05.23, 14:56 - Niki: Okay yeah I don't know if you care much if your parents find out. Exepte for the talk
22.05.23, 14:56 - Niki: *Except
22.05.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But the guy (the trainee) also had to pull out an instruction manual for how to handle it when people ask for emergency contraception and had to go over the whole thing 😂😅
22.05.23, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah well... Definitely gonna talk to my mom about contraception before Berlin, I don't really like the fact I had to do this twice now, probably not gonna mention this though
22.05.23, 14:58 - Niki: Okay I also feel bad for you. And bad about because it kinda my fault for buying them and sex you know
22.05.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, don't feel bad
22.05.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah
22.05.23, 14:59 - Niki: ?
22.05.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I realised what happened btw
22.05.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And it's really silly
22.05.23, 15:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So basically I read the instruction manual that's with the condoms
22.05.23, 15:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And one thing you have to make sure of when you put them on is you have to hold onto the tip so there's no air inside
22.05.23, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Remember when I squeezed it because the tip was bloated with air? I still think condoms should be more stretchy so it shouldn't rip because of that, but I think it might have been part of the reason why
22.05.23, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I read the manual last time in Germany when it broke, but it suddenly popped into my mind when I was trying to sleep last night
22.05.23, 15:10 - Niki: Yeah seems like it. I should have paid more attention in biology when they showed sex ed
22.05.23, 15:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dude... We got sex ed in third year of high school... I barely remember anything 😅
22.05.23, 15:14 - Niki: Yeah same but its usefull knowledge I guess
22.05.23, 15:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, true
22.05.23, 15:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm also really happy I got it because the lady said I was at a 'critical time' in my flow... 😅 So better safe than sorry after all 😅
22.05.23, 20:39 - Niki: How is your day going? What did you have for dinner and how was dancing?
22.05.23, 20:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hey love, my day's going pretty good. Went to the dentist and had dinner at my grandparents, so no time for dance unfortunately 😅
How's your day? 😘
22.05.23, 20:45 - Niki: Pretty nice volleyball Was great and we played beach volleyball
22.05.23, 20:47 - Niki: Do you think your  dentist relazied something?
22.05.23, 20:47 - Niki: What did you have for dinner?
22.05.23, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh damn, outside? Sounds really nice!
22.05.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't think so, then again, was in and out of there in 10 minutes... Pretty sure should have taken longer but anyway
22.05.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My grandma made filled zucchini with linguini
22.05.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I only just got back home
22.05.23, 21:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've been home for 10 minutes... Tell me why I feel lonely already? I thought I was good at this whole 'being on my own' thing...
22.05.23, 21:45 - Niki: Well there is no one there to distract you
22.05.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I know, I just never really had an issue with that before I left for Norway. Especially with you gone I don't know what to do. It's messed up how much I miss you already and it's only been a day. Strong independent woman my arse 🙄
22.05.23, 22:00 - Niki: That knows what she wants 🥰
22.05.23, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know exactly what I want, but unfortunately it's 733km and 30 days away
22.05.23, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to? Playing games?
22.05.23, 22:22 - Niki: Yeah kinda at university playing magic right now
22.05.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, have fun! With the bear deck or is it not finished yet? Anyway, I'll stop bothering you, hope you enjoy the games 😘
22.05.23, 22:39 - Niki: Yeah the bear deck it's really nice.
22.05.23, 22:48 - Niki: Yeah I am out now need to drive back shower and then bed 😮‍💨. Do we have dnd tomorrow?
22.05.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm also gonna take a shower and then get some sleep. Yeah, tomorrow DnD at 19
22.05.23, 22:49 - Niki: Okay mabye we can call befor need to look at my schedule
22.05.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, let me know 😊
22.05.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I hate this, already feeling the mood swings but now it's just sad and slightly depressed)
22.05.23, 22:53 - Niki: Sorry hope tomorrow it changes 😘
22.05.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so too. But now I'm gonna take a lonely shower
22.05.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Drive safe 😘
22.05.23, 23:17 - Niki: Saw a headshoke running over the street was the cute think i saw today 😍(sadly not you)
22.05.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds cute 😊
22.05.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sadly I didn't see you either
22.05.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (would be kinda creepy if I did though)
22.05.23, 23:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I regret showering
22.05.23, 23:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't smell like you anymore
22.05.23, 23:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel too clean
22.05.23, 23:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like I washed off all your touches
22.05.23, 23:38 - Niki: You didn't and I will touch you any time when you come to Berlin 😘
22.05.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know I didn't but it's just... Urg, I miss you and I'm very glad the bedsheets still smell like you
22.05.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and the small marks you left 🥰
22.05.23, 23:40 - Niki: Proud of them 🥰
22.05.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie 😘
22.05.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna try to get some sleep though, have to be up at 7 tomorrow 😅
22.05.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️
22.05.23, 23:44 - Niki: Goodnight my love ❤️
22.05.23, 23:45 - Niki: At 7 for the workers?
22.05.23, 23:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, gotta make sure Moustache is secured. Might go back to sleep after that though
22.05.23, 23:46 - Niki: Keep him with you 🥰 kinda joules if he crawled up too you then 🥺
22.05.23, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe, he probably wouldn't crawl up to me though, he's far from as affectionate as you are. Plus, you're a better cuddler 😘

24.05.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm still waiting for an explanation about this one btw
24.05.23, 17:39 - Niki: Oh sorry
24.05.23, 17:44 - Niki: It's a game where you have two teams with x persons and everybody get a beer. The teams stand on a line so parallel towards each other and between is a empty bottle. They have one ball one at a time. They try to throw at the bottle if it falls over they can drink there beer the team that has no bear left wins. They can drink as long as the bottle is on the floor. The other teams need to pick up the bottle.
24.05.23, 17:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Huh, sounds interesting to watch, never heard of it before
24.05.23, 17:55 - Niki: Its really popular in Germany

26.05.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got it
26.05.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Am I still gonna read the book?
26.05.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably
26.05.23, 17:00 - Niki: Ohh 😏 well that's interesting
26.05.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you thinking of mister? It's a 599 pages book, if that's porn without a plot I will be severely surprised. No no, I'm only reading it because of the Finnish hockey player who is the main love interest and asks the main character to marry him in Finnish the whole time so she doesn't understand him.
26.05.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although there is of course _some_ chance that I might pick up some ideas, who knows?
26.05.23, 17:43 - Niki: Yeah that's what I thought and the story sounds also interesting
26.05.23, 17:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, no clue if the story will be interesting, but the start of the book is great, basically Finnish Cursing 101
26.05.23, 17:45 - Niki: Finnish Cursing 101 ?
26.05.23, 17:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Suksi vittuun = ski into a cunt 😊
26.05.23, 17:45 - Niki: xD
26.05.23, 17:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mittä Helvetia = what the hell
26.05.23, 17:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mita vittua= what the fuck
26.05.23, 17:46 - Niki: I cant image a Finish person cursing to be honest
26.05.23, 17:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Saatana = goddamn it
26.05.23, 17:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... Can very easily actually, but it just doesn't sound like actual cursing
26.05.23, 17:47 - Niki: Yeah probably
26.05.23, 17:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My favourite:
26.05.23, 17:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mä rakastan sua
26.05.23, 17:49 - Niki: die in a sauna ?
26.05.23, 17:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh darling
26.05.23, 17:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That would be Hella funny
26.05.23, 17:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna look up what that is I need to know now
26.05.23, 17:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's kuolla saunassa apparently :)
26.05.23, 17:51 - Niki: minäkin rakastan sinua ❤️
26.05.23, 17:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will use this on Jinte
26.05.23, 17:52 - Niki: xD poor jinte
26.05.23, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, she'll live
26.05.23, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll put it in a nice way "study for your exams or kuolla saunassa"
26.05.23, 17:53 - Niki: That's a good message i would stand by
26.05.23, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for always supporting me love 😘
26.05.23, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Whatcha up to tonight?
26.05.23, 19:08 - Niki: Nothing much Alex & Killian went home for the weekend and I am doing some chores. What are you up too tonight ?
26.05.23, 19:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing much, going on a walk with my mom after dinner and that will be about it
26.05.23, 19:19 - Niki: If you want we can call after your done with the walk ?
26.05.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I'll see when that is but sure, if you feel like it. Might decide not to though, because my dad is gone on a weekend and it's just me and my mom at home, might be that she wants to do something together. I'll let you know? Take it as a tentative yes?
26.05.23, 19:22 - Niki: Okay yeah, no worries. Maybe have some quality time with your mom 😘
26.05.23, 21:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom is tired so we're not gonna do anything else tonight, what have you been up to so far?

26.05.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Some raviolis and broccoli
26.05.23, 21:29 - Niki: Wanna call after I am done eating?
26.05.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, call me when you want
26.05.23, 21:40 - Niki: Will take a bit longer sorry 😅

27.05.23, 13:20 - Niki: xD
27.05.23, 13:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you think about the name Malin for a girl? There is some disagreement on whether or not it's a good name so I'm trying to odd the evens
27.05.23, 14:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also just saved someone from being stuck in the bathroom
27.05.23, 15:18 - Niki: Malin sounds okay for a girl I don't mind
27.05.23, 15:18 - Niki: How and nice
27.05.23, 15:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The door to the women's toilet is always kinda stuck

27.05.23, 21:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, except calling you if you still want to
27.05.23, 21:18 - Niki: We can call if you want too and you are not to tiered. But I still wanna work on the project if that's okay with you?
27.05.23, 21:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you wanna work on the project we don't have to call you know? You can just focus on that 🤓
I'd like to call but not if I'm holding you back from accomplishing something+ we called yesterday so it's really not a necessity 😘

28.05.23, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
28.05.23, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk if you can hear it but that is gonna be worse in my room so yeah...

28.05.23, 00:18 - Niki: Sucks hope they stop soon so you can get a good night of sleep
28.05.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh... Sincerely doubt it, they always continue partying until 3-4 am
28.05.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If not later
28.05.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And the worst part?
28.05.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: IT'S KARAOKE
28.05.23, 00:19 - Niki: Damm that sucks
28.05.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And they can't sing for shit 🥲
28.05.23, 00:20 - Niki: I have no idea what to do against that
28.05.23, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The movie was really good though, we watched 'catch me if you can'
28.05.23, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No one does, I'll live
28.05.23, 00:20 - Niki: Mabye get yourself really tired with some hot milk or something you can sleep through the notice
28.05.23, 00:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, nah, I don't think that'll work, but thanks for the idea 😘
28.05.23, 00:21 - Niki: Great movie I love the seen in France where he gets caught
28.05.23, 00:22 - Niki: So your plans are just to go upstairs and wait until they are done?
28.05.23, 00:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have absolutely no plan, just rolling with the events as they happen
28.05.23, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, great scene! Love that he doesn't believe him but still somehow cares so much about his life while I feel like he doesn't have anything left to lose? Nice character development
28.05.23, 00:25 - Niki: Well I am really tired but if you want to we can call until I fall asleep?
28.05.23, 00:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute
28.05.23, 00:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But if you're really tired you should definitely go to sleep 😘
28.05.23, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll manage, don't worry about me

28.05.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or maybe I shouldn't have asked that if it's a sensitive topic
28.05.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh well
28.05.23, 11:22 - Niki: Yeah he is a bit mad but it's okay they fuck it up them self so yeah. It's still gone be a big topic at the celebration today

28.05.23, 16:50 - Niki: How is your day going?
28.05.23, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough, just do whatever you feel best with 😘
28.05.23, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty chill, I just spent 2 hours sitting in the sun barely doing anything and getting paid for it 👌
28.05.23, 16:52 - Niki: Nice hope it stays like this until the end. by the way do you still have a coworker today? Are Laura and her parents there?
28.05.23, 16:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so too, it's quite nice like this. But it'll probably get a bit more busy soon as there are more people playing at 6. Nah, I don't have a coworker normally, yesterday was an exception because it was so busy.
Laura and her mom should get here around 7 so not yet
28.05.23, 16:54 - Niki: Ah okay cutie 😘

29.05.23, 20:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You better :')
29.05.23, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am so incredibly frustrated. Your fucking comment about your dream was basically playing through my mind all day. I went on a fucking hike by myself. I barely ever take hikes by myself. 
And you get me so excited to call that it almost hurts to see your message (not that I don't understand, I do) and then I just kept thinking of you. About how you frustrate me, how you make my heart feel so inexplicably full, how much I miss you, the things we can do when we're together, how much I don't want to need you but still somehow I do. You know I'm all yours.
And am I overthinking things because I've been all up in my feelings for the past 3 hours? Probably, but I can't just keep this inside of me.
And I'm sorry if you're still in your meeting when you read this, especially when this was just a really long message to say I love you and you're always on my fucking mind.
29.05.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Reading this back there is absolutely no coherence but it's fine
29.05.23, 23:11 - Niki: Love the Text not through it completely. Just wanna say Love you ❤️
29.05.23, 23:22 - Niki: Okay I read it all. I kinda love it that I run through your mind like this but I am also sorry. Just wanna say it again 
I love you ❤️
29.05.23, 23:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You drive me fucking insane with just existing. 
I love you too ❤️
29.05.23, 23:25 - Niki: Oh and if it's not obivous. If you every got me running through your mind you can always send me a text 😘
29.05.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey... You run through my mind every second of the day... I'd blow your phone up and I would be even less productive than I already am
29.05.23, 23:27 - Niki: Okay thought so 🥰
29.05.23, 23:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Confident much, can't blame you for it because it's justified but still, confident much
29.05.23, 23:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was/is the meeting?
29.05.23, 23:32 - Niki: Was alright but the meetings are allways so unproductive it's awful like we need 3 hours for talking about a presentation we need to do. That takes like 3 mins 😅
29.05.23, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds shitty
29.05.23, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But at least you got something done I guess?
29.05.23, 23:33 - Niki: Yeah we got most of it done
29.05.23, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's nice
29.05.23, 23:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So what are you up to now?
29.05.23, 23:35 - Niki: Going to bed now the last 20 min of the meeting where exhausting because they got of track so often 😮‍💨
29.05.23, 23:36 - Niki: What are you up to?
29.05.23, 23:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would say the same but I've been in bed for 2 hours and I sincerely doubt I'll be going to sleep anytime soon
29.05.23, 23:38 - Niki: Well I hope I dream about you when I get to sleep soon. So mabye that's a reason for your body to sleep to dream
29.05.23, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My love... You're cute, and normally I love that about you but right now I'm gonna be honest I'm horny as fuck and dreaming about you isn't gonna do the job.
29.05.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry if I'm too straight forward
29.05.23, 23:41 - Niki: Not at all
29.05.23, 23:41 - Niki: Well Damm now I get horny too
29.05.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry 🥺
29.05.23, 23:42 - Niki: I would love to push you down and bite you where ever I can but oh well
29.05.23, 23:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I wish. I've been reading that book I told you about and it's given me some rather unholy ideas. May or may not have gotten inspiration for future adventures
29.05.23, 23:44 - Niki: Ohh well I am getting excited now 🥰
29.05.23, 23:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll have to wait pretty boy 😘
29.05.23, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's unfair how nothing feels as good as when you touch me
29.05.23, 23:54 - Niki: Well same for me. It feels weird now
29.05.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: weird how?
29.05.23, 23:56 - Niki: Just fells not that good or just bad. Also doing it alone is weird now 😅
29.05.23, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yeah, I get that. I just imagine you're here. your name is always on my mind, still doesn't make less lonely because you're not actually here when I open my eyes
29.05.23, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope it doesn't actually feel bad though
29.05.23, 23:59 - Niki: Get that soo much. Miss you 🥹
30.05.23, 00:00 - Niki: Yeah no it's fine I just, don't do it as much as before
30.05.23, 00:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you too 🥲❤️
30.05.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I never used to do it much, still don't, only when the mood hits me I guess, like tonight.
30.05.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (your comment about the dream really messed me up to be honest)
30.05.23, 00:02 - Niki: It was a really nice dream
30.05.23, 00:02 - Niki: Going to bed now too hope it starts where it stop last night
30.05.23, 00:02 - Niki: Goodnight my love ❤️
30.05.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
30.05.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope I get to join in on your dream tonight
30.05.23, 09:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning love, hope you had a good night 😘
What are you up to today?
30.05.23, 09:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also just saw discord... We might not have DnD tonight 🥲
30.05.23, 11:58 - Niki: Good morning my love. Yeah seems like it. Nothing much just university and going shopping now. What are you up too at work?
30.05.23, 12:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning. I'm not doing too much, looking at hotels and conferences.
30.05.23, 12:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *good day? It's after 12, don't think that's still morning
30.05.23, 12:19 - Niki: Yeah well 😅
30.05.23, 12:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd also kinda appreciate it if you could try not to leave me on read for too long? Idk, I know you don't do it on purpose but it makes me feel like I did something wrong 😅
Just a thumbs up or something is fine, you don't have to actually respond, but just so I know you're not ignoring me (though logically I know you wouldn't do that but idk, it just makes me feel bad or something)
30.05.23, 12:27 - Niki: Sorry I totally get that. Will do 😘
30.05.23, 12:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love ❤️
30.05.23, 14:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
30.05.23, 16:07 - Niki: Fuck sorry I was playing games with Marco and ole.
30.05.23, 16:08 - Niki: Pretty good got some university stuff done and yeah no relaxing for the afternoon
30.05.23, 16:08 - Niki: What are you up too?
30.05.23, 16:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't worry about it 😂
30.05.23, 16:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice 😊
30.05.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still at work, going through endless conferences but it's alright I guess. Also applied for another job in July
30.05.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know this isn't what I meant with being left on read right?
30.05.23, 16:17 - Niki: Yeah I know. I turn my sound for notifications back on now. I hope I hear it now 😅
30.05.23, 16:17 - Niki: Only 40 min longer then your free 🥳
30.05.23, 16:17 - Niki: Which job and where?
30.05.23, 16:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, you can go radio silent for a couple of hours, I don't care, it's just when you open a message. You really don't have to respond instantly when I send you a message 🙃
30.05.23, 16:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At a bar in Ghent. Will also apply for a museum souvenir shop later
30.05.23, 16:19 - Niki: Ah okay so you gone do something with people for sure. Hope the bar job works out sounds kinda cool and would love to visit you there
30.05.23, 16:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know I'm a little needy sometimes, but for the love of God you can have your own life without me being part of every second of your day
30.05.23, 16:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, we'll see, it pays good but the hours kinda suck
30.05.23, 16:28 - Niki: But I want you to be part of every second of my life 🥺😅. Yeah I get it no worries 😘
30.05.23, 16:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're very cute and I love you 😘
30.05.23, 17:11 - Niki: Love you too hon❤️

30.05.23, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, until this morning I was planning on DnD but I guess, unless a miracle happens, that's not happening. You?

30.05.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, if I get to come it will be a good way to practice my German, if I don't I'll take a book with me
30.05.23, 17:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wait... You mean to say I have to wait another 2 hours and 42 minutes to see you? Bullshit I say 😘

31.05.23, 09:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a weird dream again, but slept quite alright 😊
31.05.23, 09:00 - Niki: Tell me about the dream is my dad mean again 😅
31.05.23, 09:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, we went on a trip (us and Aeneas) and then I had to leave because I had my internship in the morning, but I then it turned out you guys got on your planes, but somehow I missed mine. And then I was stuck there, but my boss of my internship is there as well and I was trying to book a new ticket to get home the next day but he told me it would take at least 2 months before I got to go home because buying plane tickets on the island is really difficult.
31.05.23, 10:08 - Niki: Crazy sounds nice thought but 2 Month for plane tickets 😅
31.05.23, 10:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I was stressing out because I was gonna be stuck on that island with my boss for 2 months... Hell no
31.05.23, 11:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question, is Die Gedanken sind frei a Christmas song?
31.05.23, 11:20 - Niki: Nop not at all 😅. It's about the freedom of thoughts and that you can think what your want
31.05.23, 11:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It sounds like a Christmas song 😅
31.05.23, 11:22 - Niki: Well yeah get it's an old folk song so yeah kinda sounds
31.05.23, 11:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but more than that it sounds like an actual Christmas song I hear every year... But I can't think of what it's called 🧐
31.05.23, 11:23 - Niki: Is it dutch or English?
31.05.23, 11:23 - Niki: Kinda wanna hear it now
31.05.23, 11:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think there's versions in both languages... I'll try to think of the name
31.05.23, 11:24 - Niki: Thanks 😘. How is your day going so far?
31.05.23, 11:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty alright, got a new assignment which is basically to clean up a whole excel sheet but it's okay. How's your day going so far?
31.05.23, 11:26 - Niki: Pretty good 2 classes done now gone make lunch soon and at 14 I have another class. You probably know but there are some short cutes to clean a excel sheet
31.05.23, 11:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you're talking about formulas yes, if you're talking about other things (other than paying other people to do it) no :)
31.05.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice, have a good lunch then 😘
31.05.23, 11:28 - Niki: Yeah there are some short cutes to clean double entrys and stuff like that
31.05.23, 11:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I'm definitely not cleaning double entries... that would make it so much worse :)
31.05.23, 11:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna have tomato soup for lunch. You know what you're having?
31.05.23, 11:37 - Niki: No idea mabye some fried rice or what ever I find in the market
31.05.23, 11:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
31.05.23, 14:07 - Niki: Back in class now 🥲. How was your lunch? What are you up too?
31.05.23, 14:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck in class. Lunch was nice, talked a lot with the new intern. We're probably gonna go out at some point this weekend so I can show her around Ghent. 
I'm still working, nothing new there 😊
31.05.23, 15:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am 100% overthinking shit again 🥲, should have never read that website yesterday :(
31.05.23, 15:46 - Niki: Wait what website sorry if you told me but I can't remember anything about that
31.05.23, 15:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The website about the pill thing, idk, shouldn't have read it when I was finally not that worried about it anymore.
31.05.23, 15:48 - Niki: Sounds nice does she life in Ghent now and hope you can show her the nice things of Ghent
31.05.23, 15:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, she's living here until September, then she goes back to Paris
31.05.23, 15:49 - Niki: Wanna talk about mabye you can get it out of your system and i can give my opinion
31.05.23, 15:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, not much to say other than that I'm worried it didn't work and god knows I really do not want to deal with that if it's true.
31.05.23, 15:54 - Niki: I mean there are 2 probability one that the sperm last that long and then that the pill didn't work so 2 possibility of 80~90% so pretty low
31.05.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, there is a third possibility. I ovulated in the 3 days between and then it's fucked too, honestly that's what I'm most worried about
31.05.23, 16:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then again, idk, I think everything is just kinda getting to me and I'm choosing to overthink this thing because it's the least in my control at this point. I'm sorry I'm bothering you with this, I feel like I should be more positive about things 😅
31.05.23, 16:01 - Niki: Oh yeah I don't know what to right about that. Just need to wait for your next period.
31.05.23, 16:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp… Guess so, the waiting game really sucks though
31.05.23, 16:07 - Niki: Yeah got me worried abit 😅.
31.05.23, 16:08 - Niki: Well be as exsited as you
31.05.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry 🥺
31.05.23, 16:19 - Niki: Please don't  apologize for that it's something I am also more than involved
31.05.23, 16:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just don't want to worry you and yet I say things like this anyway 😅
31.05.23, 16:23 - Niki: Yeah I would be more worried if you didn't tell me what's on your mind
31.05.23, 16:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay. You know I want to know how you feel about things too right?
31.05.23, 16:28 - Niki: Yeah I know. Love you 😘
31.05.23, 16:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good, love you too 😘
31.05.23, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found out I have my final oral presentation the 22nd 🥳
31.05.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Means I could be there the 23rd if you'd want that
31.05.23, 18:05 - Niki: YES please 🥰. Hope your presentation goes well and the train here is not that bad
31.05.23, 18:05 - Niki: Only if it's reasonable time and stress wise please
31.05.23, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, not getting up at 5 this time, no worries 😅
I'll check the hours and book my ticket tonight 😘
31.05.23, 18:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have my presentation at 14 so I have more than enough time to go for a drink with my teammates and then go home to pack my bag, have a good night sleep and take the train
31.05.23, 18:10 - Niki: Nice
31.05.23, 18:34 - Niki: I wanna say in the group chat that meeting people from Norway helps me with that but with out insulting or shaming him you know what I mean
31.05.23, 18:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How would that insult him?
31.05.23, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But you could put it like he could try to find more Erasmus communities, pretty sure there's some student clubs where he could talk to Norwegian Erasmus students? Idk?
31.05.23, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is it okay if I'm in Leipzig by 15:10? You don't have a class or anything right?
31.05.23, 18:59 - Niki: Yeah nothing planed
31.05.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, buying the ticket then 😊
31.05.23, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ordered 🥳
31.05.23, 19:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I showed my dad the playlist with German songs you made and he asked about a song about rapes (why he immediately thought of it idk) but doesn't know what it's called... Any clue?
31.05.23, 19:28 - Niki: Rapes? I don't understand what that means?
31.05.23, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sexual rapes? I think? Or sexual assaults?
31.05.23, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's how he explained it 😅
31.05.23, 19:31 - Niki: Oh well to be honest there are a few 😅 will look for some
31.05.23, 19:31 - Niki: The famous one is from Falco
31.05.23, 19:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I said the name Falco and he said yes 😂
31.05.23, 19:58 - Niki: Okay yeah it's jeanny
31.05.23, 19:59 - Niki: The song name
31.05.23, 20:42 - Niki: Oh the song also got some major controversies because the girl went missing and uses the TV missing report in the song crazy but nice song.
31.05.23, 20:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you! That's the song he was talking about indeed 😘
31.05.23, 20:56 - Niki: How is your night going? Any plans for the rest of the day?
31.05.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's alright, just got back home from eating fries, kinda dizzy though. I have nothing planned for the rest. You?

01.06.23, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How long have you been there btw?
01.06.23, 19:09 - Niki: Now 2 hours now and my uncle invite me for dinner a can't say no but I am gone go fast
01.06.23, 19:10 - Niki: Das Bild ist in der Werkstatt entstanden
01.06.23, 19:10 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
01.06.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I'm guessing later than 9?
01.06.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dude... You're not gonna tell me datenight is gonna be way later and then follow it up by making me jealous of a car... Not a good idea my guy
01.06.23, 19:26 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
01.06.23, 19:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, that's too late now
01.06.23, 19:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice try
01.06.23, 19:26 - Niki: Alex made a sticker out of it.
01.06.23, 19:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I am gonna use that in the future)
01.06.23, 19:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Seems like a him thing to do yeah
01.06.23, 19:29 - Niki: Yeah I think around 9 hopefully I try to finish it fast
01.06.23, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhu, we'll see
01.06.23, 19:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me know I guess
01.06.23, 19:45 - Niki: Will do sorry again I taught it would take 20 mins
01.06.23, 20:48 - Niki: I am driving back now from Leipzig so gone be there i a hour
01.06.23, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm genuinely trying not to be annoyed right now but I hope you understand that's kinda difficult. I know you couldn't do much about it but I could have done something else tonight and I decided to stay home to call you. Initially at 8, then at 9 and now apparently closer to 10. Once again I know you couldn't do much about it, but I also would have liked it if you communicated what was going on before, rather than just now telling me you're leaving and will be home in an hour. I wouldn't have been in this position of trying not to be annoyed because I know it's not your fault if you'd just said "hey, it's gonna be difficult to be on time, is it okay if we reschedule?" 
Idk, I'm hoping I still make sense here. But I guess we can talk about it later
01.06.23, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also EYES ON THE FUCKING ROAD BUDDY
01.06.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm annoyed but I still love you and I will be actually angry if you don't call me later.
01.06.23, 21:14 - Niki: On my way home right now will read it later but already feeling bad and I am sorry.
01.06.23, 22:06 - Niki: Walking home form where I parked takes like 10 more min than I will call you
01.06.23, 22:06 - Niki: Sorry need to write the Text while I drove
01.06.23, 22:21 - Niki: I don't know what's happening but it's kinda fuck up

Yeah, I saw the group chat, I have such a hard time believing he doesn't have an accent but if he doesn't I'm so happy for him too!
02.06.23, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record, my hard time believing it is simply because I have a hard time imagining it and not because I think he isn't able of it

02.06.23, 14:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am not a fan of google spreadsheets... The formulas are gonna make me kill myself

03.06.23, 12:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A girl I met during an after school debate program in high school, we met up last year for lunch I think, every so often we think about each other and send a message, and with every so often I mean quite literally once a year

03.06.23, 18:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, he said his back is hurting, I told him he shouldn't be picking up heavy crates then and a random dude said I should give him a massage then if I was so worried
03.06.23, 18:56 - Niki: xD Well love the people just walking past and talk without  being part of the conversations
03.06.23, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, not that big of a fan honestly, at least not in this case

03.06.23, 20:32 - Niki: Well you can hint that you have a boyfriend if you don't want to be so direct
03.06.23, 20:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dude... I literally told him 😭
03.06.23, 20:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He's drunk though, so I guess there's that
03.06.23, 20:44 - Niki: xD well sucks but oh well need to endure it then
03.06.23, 20:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I fucking hate it but yeah, guess so

03.06.23, 20:48 - Niki: xD
03.06.23, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is kinda funny how so many of my grandpa's friends try to set me up with their sons though...
03.06.23, 21:02 - Niki: xD
03.06.23, 21:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just saw the dad's tab and... Makes sense that he's drunk Jesus Christ

04.06.23, 14:06 - Niki: Yeah okish i guess it's family time
04.06.23, 14:07 - Niki: The hardest part is too start with work you don't wanna do
04.06.23, 14:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you do during family time? Play boardgames, chat, idk?
Yeah... Starting is fucking difficult
04.06.23, 14:09 - Niki: Chat and we did some gardening together and now we are sitting in the living room  half a sleep and kinda talking
04.06.23, 14:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds pretty chill

04.06.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
04.06.23, 15:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just realised corals trigger my trypophobia... Fuck this shit I'm never touching them again... Why are they full of holes???
04.06.23, 15:54 - Niki: Yeah get the fear. it's also still evedince for your crimes.
04.06.23, 15:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no
04.06.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not afraid of them
04.06.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just really despise the holes in the coral
04.06.23, 15:57 - Niki: Okay but your procrastination a bit
04.06.23, 15:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A bit??? A bit??? I feel like I haven't done anything else today
04.06.23, 15:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I probably won't get the motivation to do anything until later tonight around 9
04.06.23, 16:00 - Niki: Damm girl well then tonight good luck 😘😅
04.06.23, 16:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh... I fucking suck at doing things I don't like when there's no hard deadline 😭😅

04.06.23, 16:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have you ever been to the unterwelt in Berlin?
04.06.23, 17:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also do you know anything about TUV stickers for cars? Apparently there's green zones or something in Berlin?
04.06.23, 17:15 - Niki: Yeah but most cars have green
04.06.23, 17:15 - Niki: Nope
04.06.23, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Noice, you will then :)

04.06.23, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently we do need a sticker
04.06.23, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
04.06.23, 18:07 - Niki: Okay if you would like me to do something just ask 😘
04.06.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, I think we're gonna order it online, but I think you need it for your car too? Unless you wanna take a train to Berlin, that works too
04.06.23, 18:10 - Niki: In Germany its on every car
04.06.23, 18:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooohhh
04.06.23, 18:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's cool
04.06.23, 18:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In Belgium we don't have the stickers because it's all checked by our numberplate
04.06.23, 18:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And for foreign cars... Nobody really cares I guess?
04.06.23, 18:12 - Niki: Yeah but police rarely controls it thought
04.06.23, 18:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's only €6 so my dad is gonna get it anyway
04.06.23, 18:13 - Niki: Okay
04.06.23, 18:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We planned out the first 2 days and then Friday and Saturday are just free for now. If you have any suggestions they're always welcome 😊
04.06.23, 18:16 - Niki: Yeah gonna ask so people for ideas but sounds nice. What's planned so far?
04.06.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On Wednesday we all get there, then we go to the unterwelt, a 2 hour tour about tunnels underneath the Berlin Wall. After that we go eat at a stube (?) On Thursday we go on a three-hour bike tour in the morning, afternoon is still free and then in the evening is the fancy restaurant called Tisk. That's about it. And on Saturday I think we leave around 4 or 5 (though my dad was talking about extending it one more day so idk for sure about that one)
04.06.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're still at your parents' place? How's your afternoon been?
04.06.23, 18:24 - Niki: Nah went out with Alex and Patrick/Patrick girlfriend to a lake. But gone eat dinner with my parents to night
04.06.23, 18:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, sounds nice! Have a good time! ❤️
04.06.23, 19:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I fucking hate this period tracking app. Just got a notification: PMS or early pregnancy signs, how to know which it is? 
... These motherfuckers...
And then the actual information is behind a fucking paywall... I can't
04.06.23, 19:46 - Niki: Damm that's really a asshole move. Also they keep listening all the time
04.06.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They do 😭... Can they please not fucking remind me though? I was blissfully forgetting about it and now I'm anxious again... Bastards... Anyway, hope you have a nice dinner with your parents 😅😘
04.06.23, 20:05 - Niki: Yeah went to a Italian restaurant it's amazing
04.06.23, 20:06 - Niki: Hope you forget it again
04.06.23, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight I guess ❤️

04.06.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, the I guess wasn't meant to critique you 😭
04.06.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just meant that I will try to go to sleep but I probably won't be able to 😅
04.06.23, 23:55 - Niki: Ups 😅
04.06.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry, I should have communicated that better
04.06.23, 23:56 - Niki: No worrys was sure either but yeah okay thanks
04.06.23, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not as much as I would have liked to at all, felt paralyzed all day for some reason

04.06.23, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I am going to school tomorrow, will definitely work there though
04.06.23, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was your evening?
04.06.23, 23:59 - Niki: Pretty nice but a bit long 😅
05.06.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
05.06.23, 00:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm trying to decide if I should try and get more done now or if I should just go to sleep
05.06.23, 00:05 - Niki: Sleep is probably the better solution get up earlier tomorrow you know but you need to decide 😘
05.06.23, 00:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I know but I just don't think I'll be able to fall asleep soon anyway, I'm too wired up
05.06.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then again I also feel like anything I did right now would be terrible anyway... Fuck this shit. I'm actually gonna go insane over the next 2 weeks, just watch me I guess 😅
05.06.23, 00:08 - Niki: You got this babe no worries. But I gone go sleep now

05.06.23, 01:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you so much it feels like I'm in trouble sometimes. Don't know what I would do without you at this point honestly.
05.06.23, 01:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also we're not having sex until I get on proper birth control because I could not deal with a situation like this again goddamn
05.06.23, 01:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sleep is evading me and thinking of you and how much I love you is honestly the only thing that is even slightly calming me down at this point, make of that what you will
05.06.23, 01:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you're having a wonderful night sleep though 😘
05.06.23, 08:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning love ❤️

05.06.23, 12:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There were riots in Leipzig?
05.06.23, 12:45 - Niki: Yeah they were because of a judgement on some left vs right stuff nothing new I guess
05.06.23, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, guess not, still, not that nice

05.06.23, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's kinda messed up
05.06.23, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry if I'm very low energy today btw
05.06.23, 12:48 - Niki: No worrys 😘
05.06.23, 12:49 - Niki: Had a bad sleep or just the BAP draining your energy?
05.06.23, 12:49 - Niki: Yeah it is but oh well extremest what can you expect
05.06.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just feel like shit, I think it's partially stress, lack of sleep and not having eaten enough today :)
Doing great 👍
05.06.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair
05.06.23, 12:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, I'm going to apply for my driver's licence in half an hour so that's pretty cool 😊
05.06.23, 12:52 - Niki: You better eat something soon and sleep when you get home love 😤😘
05.06.23, 12:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah yeah, I know, eating mais crackers as we're speaking. Can't leave school before 4 though and still have to do some things then.

05.06.23, 12:55 - Niki: Okay but please eat more than mais crackers 😘
05.06.23, 12:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't have more and don't have time, maybe I'll stop by the cafeteria for something small after my appointment
05.06.23, 15:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I got half a kilo of cherries and damn, eating food really helped

08.06.23, 13:42 - Niki: How is your day going so far?
08.06.23, 13:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's alright, pretty boring today
08.06.23, 15:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
08.06.23, 16:02 - Niki: Haha love jinte for that kinda of humor 😂
08.06.23, 16:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want to be her mother... She's demon spawn
08.06.23, 16:03 - Niki: But you also call her child alot 🙄(sideeye)
08.06.23, 16:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, we're calling at 20 again tonight right?
08.06.23, 16:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oi oi, she deserves it
08.06.23, 16:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I call a lot more people child
08.06.23, 16:03 - Niki: Yes
08.06.23, 16:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Even when they're years older than me
08.06.23, 16:04 - Niki: Big family
08.06.23, 16:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: nah, half the time it's an insult, maybe 20% of the time it's an endearment. Not sure about the other 30%
08.06.23, 16:05 - Niki: But nice that she is studying hope she gets through her exams sane.
08.06.23, 16:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfftt… Yeah, she's studying… my arse, I keep getting messages on both messenger and instagram… And she is in a library, she has gone to look at the books way too often… Oh well
08.06.23, 16:07 - Niki: Yeah that's the curse of phones and other media device you can't study anymore 😅
08.06.23, 16:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True... It's an issue
08.06.23, 16:08 - Niki: How is work going by the way. Still boring?
08.06.23, 16:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but now we're making LinkedIn posts, so it's alright I guess. We're also going out for drinks after work tomorrow
08.06.23, 16:09 - Niki: English is a shity language at times. Wanted to ask how your day befor your last day is going but there is no word for that I think.
08.06.23, 16:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goddamn, there really isn't a word for that in English... That sucks. In Dutch it's 'voorlaatste' how about German?
08.06.23, 16:10 - Niki: Nice how is the "new" inter doing by the way? She got it after your two are gone?
08.06.23, 16:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh... remains to be seen, but I think she'll be fine, I just have too high expectations I guess
08.06.23, 16:11 - Niki: In German it's "vor letzter Arbeitstag"
08.06.23, 16:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's basically the same, just that Arbeitstag is 'werkdag' in Dutch
08.06.23, 16:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going home early today
08.06.23, 16:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your afternoon going?
08.06.23, 16:45 - Niki: Just studying and talk with Alex and Killian from time to time. A bit boring
08.06.23, 16:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Unfortunately it has to happen too 😘
08.06.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Might be a little late... Sorry 🥲
08.06.23, 19:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Trying to manage dinner in this house before 8 is practically impossible 😅
08.06.23, 19:53 - Niki: No worries take your time
08.06.23, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ready?
08.06.23, 20:15 - Niki: Yeah

13.06.23, 11:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have no idea how relieved I am
13.06.23, 11:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, doubt it, this is gonna suck, but I am happy about it

I wish I could somehow send you some energy over the phone or something ❤️ maybe take a nap if that's possible? Please take care of yourself 😭

14.06.23, 15:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going hon?
14.06.23, 15:17 - Niki: Okayish still got a lot too do but its getting done
14.06.23, 15:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know if it translates but in Dutch there's a saying meaning a good start is already half done. I think it applies :)
14.06.23, 15:18 - Niki: how is your day going by the way?
14.06.23, 15:20 - Niki: Yeah got something similar in German
14.06.23, 15:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good, I found presents and am eating ice cream with Jinte now 😊
14.06.23, 15:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
14.06.23, 15:25 - Niki: Nice hope it tastes good
14.06.23, 15:25 - Niki: The ice-cream looks good
14.06.23, 15:26 - Niki: Say hi too jinte for me
14.06.23, 15:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte says hi back
14.06.23, 15:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have you ever had frozen yoghurt?
14.06.23, 15:37 - Niki: Nope
14.06.23, 15:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The ice cream is really good 😋
14.06.23, 15:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You like yoghurt?
14.06.23, 15:38 - Niki: Not my favorite but would try
14.06.23, 15:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, will take you here next time then 😘
14.06.23, 18:48 - Niki: Mabye I fuck up a bit...
14.06.23, 18:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh dear, what happened?
14.06.23, 18:49 - Niki: Told Alex and Fabian about our plans for a vacation and they got really hypt in to Irland. Because Fabian ask us if we wanted to go on holiday together
14.06.23, 18:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well
14.06.23, 18:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That wasn't that big of a fuck up
14.06.23, 18:56 - Niki: What did you thought I did?
14.06.23, 18:56 - Niki: Oh they also thought about going to Croatia
14.06.23, 18:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I thought you missed the date for the next pitch or something and it's while we're in Berlin or something like that
14.06.23, 18:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Croatia is nice
14.06.23, 18:57 - Niki: Sounds a lot like me 😅
14.06.23, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't really have an issue with it, though I would prefer if it was just us
14.06.23, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So if you really can't tell them no, I do have a middle ground idea. We have different accommodations, so we still have some privacy and alone time
14.06.23, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, honestly though that's literally the biggest fuck up I could imagine you making and it's not even that bad, would be annoying but manageable
14.06.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still prefer it to be just us, for the record, but I honestly don't have that big of an issue with it. As long as they speak English or at least try 😅 otherwise I will probably feel left out the whole time, not gonna lie
14.06.23, 19:02 - Niki: Yeah they wont come along
14.06.23, 19:03 - Niki: i will vito this the travel. Now they also think about parg

14.06.23, 19:04 - Niki: Budapest sounds really nice
14.06.23, 19:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're going to the food thing soon?
14.06.23, 19:05 - Niki: no dont think so
14.06.23, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, how come?
14.06.23, 19:08 - Niki: We got stuff todo and we dont know if the others will come
14.06.23, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sadly

16.06.23, 10:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon ❤️
No problem but now you're making me think I really should have gotten you that personalised calendar 😋
Say hi to your parents for me?
16.06.23, 10:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does sound weird. I dreamt I was stuck on that island again... Weird to have to repeat honestly
16.06.23, 10:22 - Niki: Will do gone go soon. 
Yeah mabye would have been good probably
16.06.23, 10:23 - Niki: What's on the island?
16.06.23, 10:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing?? It's a desolate place with a way too big airport for what it actually is... I don't understand why I get stuck there every time
16.06.23, 10:25 - Niki: Your boss still there or are you still waiting for your flight
16.06.23, 10:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This time we went out for dinner, my boss wasn't there but I think you were (I don't fully remember) and I missed my plane because I was too late at the gate but then I wasn't and it just turned out there was no plane to Brussels... Idk, had to wait until the next morning (Monday) to get another plane to go home
16.06.23, 11:41 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
16.06.23, 11:41 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
16.06.23, 11:42 - Niki: Is that good enough for the dinner
16.06.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You look really nice 😘
16.06.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think it's up to standard, depending on the pants but then again who the fuck cares
16.06.23, 11:44 - Niki: Okay nice gone wear it then. With some normal jeans I guess will see you can you can help me pick out my outfit 🥰

16.06.23, 11:47 - Niki: White with a blue on it
16.06.23, 11:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me put it this way. The first one make you look hot, the second makes you look like I could take you to church
Depends on how you'd like to look I guess?
16.06.23, 11:48 - Niki: I will take both with me so you can see them in person
16.06.23, 11:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay! 😘

16.06.23, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm also loving all these pictures I'm getting from you 😁
16.06.23, 13:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just lost and found my phone in less than 5 minutes
16.06.23, 13:46 - Niki: Well the panic for nothing
16.06.23, 13:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
16.06.23, 13:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Lost it, looked for it and less than 5 minutes after I lost it I went to the reception and they had it... Fucking lucky
16.06.23, 13:53 - Niki: Nice ☺️
16.06.23, 14:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Presentation in 10 minutes... Gonna die 😊
16.06.23, 18:02 - Niki: How did it go? Still out for drinks with your BAP group or working on the presentation?
16.06.23, 18:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, lot's of comments so lots of work still before Monday 😅
16.06.23, 18:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm at home relaxing now
16.06.23, 18:15 - Niki: Nice hope you get most of it done
16.06.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah... Not nice 🥲
16.06.23, 18:16 - Niki: I mean at least they tell you what you need to do u guess
16.06.23, 18:17 - Niki: Sorry 🥺 didn't mean it in a bad way
16.06.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, the guy said I look like a robot when I present so that kinda sucked
16.06.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know, no worries 😘
16.06.23, 18:18 - Niki: Same girl they always say I have zero emotions while presenting
16.06.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The thing is I'm usually quite good at presenting so I don't know why he said that?? Anyway yeah, guess we'll have to work on it for quite a bit still
16.06.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What time do you want to call tonight? 8 as always?
16.06.23, 18:19 - Niki: Yeah 8 sounds good can do earlier or later if you want to too
16.06.23, 18:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just have to eat food, got nothing else planned today, whatever you want
16.06.23, 18:20 - Niki: Then after you ate food?
16.06.23, 18:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure

16.06.23, 23:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight love ❤️
17.06.23, 07:38 - Niki: Hope you had a good night. Sorry but I  fell asleep really fast. Sleept really nice though.
17.06.23, 10:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's okay, I figured that was the case 😘
I slept really good too, dreamt about you 😊
17.06.23, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning 😉
17.06.23, 10:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was thinking about the car thing... And the pop-up lights are so fucking cool I don't understand why they didn't make them a special feature? As in you can have the normal lights, but you also have a button to switch between the normal lights and the fancy as fuck pop-up lights. Could even be a feature that costs more than the standard version but it would just be really cool I think
17.06.23, 10:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How difficult would it be to modify a car you think? 😋
17.06.23, 10:27 - Niki: No idea but would try if I had some car knowledge 😅. I also love that you think about really small so much it's really cute. Love that about you ❤️
17.06.23, 10:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... You were really excited talking about it and you looked really cute so I just thought about it because of how cute you are but then again the pop-up lights really are cool so yeah idk 😅
17.06.23, 10:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was also really disappointed when I woke up this morning because I literally dreamt I drove over to your place and we were just hanging around kissing and cuddling and ahhhh... I don't want to wait
17.06.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You also are fish in that dream though... Kinda weird
17.06.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no
17.06.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You were eating fish
17.06.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goddamn it
17.06.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't type
17.06.23, 10:43 - Niki: I am fish 😅
17.06.23, 11:38 - Niki: Hope you have a productive day while working on the BAP hon 😘
17.06.23, 11:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love 😘

17.06.23, 12:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, that explains his Instagram story
17.06.23, 12:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope he has a nice time at the celebrations
17.06.23, 12:05 - Niki: Yeah hope soo too

17.06.23, 16:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad you're having a good day 😘
Mine is not as productive as I wanted to, but it's okay. Also turns out my dad doesn't need my help today after all. But people will probably get here soon so can't work for much longer.
17.06.23, 16:43 - Niki: Hope you can relax with the people that are coming over and you also have tomorrow for the BAP so I guess that works.
17.06.23, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah true, got Monday too but still
17.06.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is pure chaos
17.06.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is incredible

17.06.23, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's just so much going on I can't follow very well 😅
17.06.23, 18:29 - Niki: Jesus that's a lot of people and a lot of things happening.
17.06.23, 18:29 - Niki: forgot to send the messages for 3 mins ups 😅

17.06.23, 23:08 - Niki: okay why not seems nice
17.06.23, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh... We'll see once we actually get there
17.06.23, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They also have absolutely no clue where to go or anything
17.06.23, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening going?

17.06.23, 23:29 - Niki: And some nice storys about your parents you never heard befor ?
17.06.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, some
17.06.23, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad apparently used to have a friend who was a DJ but didn't have any place to practice so he said he could do it at his apartment. At that time my dad worked at night but the guy had to practise during the day so he just slept through it somehow 😅
17.06.23, 23:33 - Niki: xD
17.06.23, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And some other things too, like how they used to find places to go out and how it was an adventure every time
17.06.23, 23:34 - Niki: nice sounds like great memorys
17.06.23, 23:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, they look happy looking back
18.06.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It got too late so even while there's still people I decided to go to bed 😅

18.06.23, 09:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you do too ❤️
18.06.23, 10:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So my dad apparently drank a bottle of rum with 1 of his friends...😅
On top of all the other things, goddamn that man can handle his booze Jesus... His friend also drove him like that 🙄😤
18.06.23, 10:45 - Niki: " His friend also drove him like that 🙄 " Damm that's not good. But crazy that he can handel his booze so well
18.06.23, 10:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, he got home safely but my mom and I are quite annoyed at it
18.06.23, 10:48 - Niki: Yeah with a good reason
18.06.23, 14:43 - Niki: How is your day going so far?
18.06.23, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's alright. How's yours?
18.06.23, 15:12 - Niki: It's going okayish kinda procrastinating trough the howl day but still getting stuff done 😅

18.06.23, 15:13 - Niki: Also i made rice pudding and burnt the milk and I need to clean it 😭
18.06.23, 15:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That sucks... You make a new packet for yourself then?
18.06.23, 15:15 - Niki: nah just the bottom burned so its fine i still ate it
18.06.23, 15:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, Yeah, fair
18.06.23, 15:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you clean it right away?
18.06.23, 15:16 - Niki: yeah
18.06.23, 15:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For future reference, it's easier if you let it soak with some water and dish soap, it comes straight off after like 10 minutes
18.06.23, 15:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk if that's useful info or not
18.06.23, 15:17 - Niki: thx will do
18.06.23, 15:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry, I have like... 0.01% of energy right now
18.06.23, 15:24 - Niki: no worries 😘
18.06.23, 15:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Seeing a message from you does give me more energy though, it's nice
18.06.23, 16:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This fucking thing makes me want to start drinking alcohol... I will be so happy when it is over on Thursday
18.06.23, 16:28 - Niki: You got it hon just hang in there a little bit longer okay 😘
18.06.23, 16:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You do not understand... The urge to just down a glass of whiskey is... Not okay
18.06.23, 16:31 - Niki: If you down a class you won't be able to write anymore I think
18.06.23, 16:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably
18.06.23, 16:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not going to
18.06.23, 16:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But damn I just want to forget about this
18.06.23, 16:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still holding onto the no drinking until my birthday thing, no worries
18.06.23, 16:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Though I have to say, hearing about the others groups is making me feel better
18.06.23, 16:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out there's a group that only has 45 pages... Sources and everything
18.06.23, 16:34 - Niki: Well some group just don't work well together
18.06.23, 16:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no, they apparently were confident about their work
18.06.23, 16:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know them, this is just from hearsay but still
18.06.23, 16:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I asked the guy that told me about it to let me know how that ends, I need to know if they graduate or not
18.06.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My darling, what's up
18.06.23, 18:38 - Niki: What up shorty 😘

18.06.23, 18:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (but I'll gladly take advantage of that offer 😘)
18.06.23, 18:42 - Niki: But I will bite back 🥰
18.06.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can't be acting shocked when you first instigated it... Tss

19.06.23, 00:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tell me why you're the reason I'm laying awake and not my schoolwork or my first solo car ride? Why I keep imagining you laying next to me in bed? Why I can't get you out of my head ever?
God knows I don't need you but I want you in my life all the more, so it still hurts when you're part of it from so far away.
19.06.23, 01:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also have one request if that's okay
19.06.23, 01:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When we go to your parents, can it please not be Saturday morning?

20.06.23, 09:49 - Niki: Sucks but same to be honest 😅
20.06.23, 09:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Today there's no real plans so I'm probably just gonna read the BAP 20 times to study it by heart
20.06.23, 09:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are your plans other than uni?
20.06.23, 10:14 - Niki: Going through the presentation a billion times
20.06.23, 14:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How are you doing hon?
20.06.23, 14:55 - Niki: I just thought about you. Then your text came and my heart skipped a beat 🥰
20.06.23, 14:55 - Niki: Okayish kinda procrastinating but it's okay
20.06.23, 14:55 - Niki: What are you up too?
20.06.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Perfect timing as always ;)
20.06.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm procrastinating too... Should read through the BAP but honestly don't feel like it after working on it for so long
20.06.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So yeah
20.06.23, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's okay
20.06.23, 14:57 - Niki: Feel that
20.06.23, 14:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're working on the presentation alone right now? Or are you at uni with Alex or something?
20.06.23, 14:59 - Niki: Presentation alone. Alex got stuff to do but we gone rehears later.
20.06.23, 15:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay :)
20.06.23, 15:00 - Niki: By the way Alex ask if we wanna do a escape room on Sunday's?
20.06.23, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds fun, but if it's in German I can not promise to be of any value whatsoever 😂
20.06.23, 15:02 - Niki: Yeah no worries 😅
20.06.23, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll go along with anything you want to do :)
20.06.23, 15:25 - Niki: Okay so we go to my parents house on Sunday lunch. And the escape room we are still planning.
20.06.23, 15:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, sounds good!
20.06.23, 15:28 - Niki: I am getting really excited for you and it's still 3 days 🥲.
20.06.23, 15:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, me too, It's just 72 hours but I want it to be over already 🥰🥲
20.06.23, 15:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh btw, because I drove to the sea and back yesterday my dad said I might be able to drive to Germany after all, not this time obviously but soon enough :)
20.06.23, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: HEY
20.06.23, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can drive
20.06.23, 15:30 - Niki: I know you can 😘
20.06.23, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
20.06.23, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure
20.06.23, 15:31 - Niki: It's just your dad change his opinion kinda fast.
20.06.23, 15:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well yes, but then again, he said I wouldn't be able to drive there this year, now it's more of a "maybe in autumn"
20.06.23, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's progress, so I'm not gonna complain
20.06.23, 15:32 - Niki: Oh hon i kinda wanna tease you more but I won't mabye I do it in person 😅
20.06.23, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: … I like it when you tease me but it is indeed a lot more fun in person
20.06.23, 15:32 - Niki: I will love when and where ever we meet
20.06.23, 15:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't wait for Friday
20.06.23, 19:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Might have made a small mistake in telling Nicolas I'm coming to visit you soon. He said he might want to hang out if he has time, however I didn't tell him where you live, just "somewhere around Leipzig" or when exactly I'll be there so there's a lot of plausible deniability still :)
20.06.23, 19:06 - Niki: Its okay yeah we will see
20.06.23, 19:06 - Niki: Your still in contact with him?
20.06.23, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really
20.06.23, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just posted on my story that I got my licence and he congratulated me for that, so now he sent me pictures of his parents' new puppy
20.06.23, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening going?
20.06.23, 19:08 - Niki: Cute puppy?
20.06.23, 19:09 - Niki: Well okayish still reading the presentation so I got it too 100% in me. Play a few games befor
20.06.23, 19:09 - Niki: I don't think we have dnd tonight?
20.06.23, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very cute!
20.06.23, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
20.06.23, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
20.06.23, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good idea
20.06.23, 19:10 - Niki: Awww cute
20.06.23, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, don't think so either
20.06.23, 19:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What time is the presentation tomorrow?
20.06.23, 19:12 - Niki: 13:00
20.06.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll do great 😘
20.06.23, 19:15 - Niki: Thanks that feels nice to hear 🥰
20.06.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm only saying what I'm 100% convinced of you know?
20.06.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also the cat trick you sent me on Instagram? Does not work with Moustache I'm afraid
20.06.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or maybe I'm just doing it wrong
20.06.23, 19:21 - Niki: Thanks Hon i love you ❤️
20.06.23, 19:21 - Niki: Sad but oh well Moustache is just smarter than other cats
20.06.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you too 🥰
20.06.23, 19:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd say the opposite but I'll just take the compliment for him and say thank you 😊
20.06.23, 20:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're still studying tonight or relaxing a bit too?
20.06.23, 20:55 - Niki: Reading the presentation and relaxing mostly
20.06.23, 20:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, don't push yourself too hard. I'm sure you already know exactly what to say
20.06.23, 20:56 - Niki: Yeah I do but still I don't know
20.06.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're stressed and worried? Makes sense, but like I said, the more you're hung up on it, the more you're gonna stress over it and in the end, being too stressed is what ruins a presentation most of the time (if the preparations were thorough enough I mean)
20.06.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, does that make sense?
20.06.23, 20:59 - Niki: Yeah it does probably gone watch some where I can turn off my brain
20.06.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's something you're watching at the moment or you're gonna have to decide still?
20.06.23, 21:00 - Niki: No idea
20.06.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun finding something then 😘
20.06.23, 23:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love, I hope you have a relaxing evening/night ❤️
21.06.23, 09:29 - Niki: Good morning Hon my night was okayish just woke up around 5 for some reason. After 13:30 today is gone be a good day
21.06.23, 09:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You went to sleep early last night? Maybe that's why you woke up so early? Stress never helps too. 
I hope the presentation goes well 😘
21.06.23, 12:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck my love, you'll do amazing 😘🍀🍀🍀🍀
21.06.23, 12:37 - Niki: I am really excited
21.06.23, 12:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's great!! Let me know how it went afterwards? I'm excited for you 😊

21.06.23, 18:15 - Niki: Oh sorry got back half a hour ago and started cleaning my room😅.
We did well as i said. We got there and talk with some of the other teams and after 20 mins we got in. We present our presentation pretty good if I can tell so about my self. Got to the question round and answered all there questions. They seemed pretty confined about our idea. They will tell us in 2/3 workdays. After that we went out to celebrate and drinks. Till 16:30 we gone to a river and relaxing there and talking.
21.06.23, 18:23 - Niki: By the way I am cleaning because you are comeing over. So Alex made some jokes about it but they were kinda funny in the moment
21.06.23, 19:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice, I hope you get a reply soon! What kind of ideas did the other teams have or you didn't talk about it?
21.06.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What kind of jokes did he make?
21.06.23, 19:05 - Niki: Just that I clean and it's an indicator of you comeing over 😅
21.06.23, 19:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, pretty sure my mom would make a similar joke
21.06.23, 19:06 - Niki: We talk to 3 teams. One of the had a app where the track movement and play Musik according to your movement. The other team had a pharmacy app or something like that. Last team I forgot but wasn't real great
21.06.23, 19:07 - Niki: There are kinda funny to be honest
21.06.23, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like interesting projects
21.06.23, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's only for electronic/digital ideas?
21.06.23, 19:09 - Niki: Dont think so
21.06.23, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just a little bit, as long as it's not done in front of your entire family I guess 😅

22.06.23, 08:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honest question, is this professional enough of an outfit?
22.06.23, 08:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
22.06.23, 08:33 - Niki: It looks great 😍. You look beautiful and love your "smile" is brilliant.
22.06.23, 08:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute
22.06.23, 08:34 - Niki: Good morning my night was good sadly didn't dream about you. Hope your day goes smoothly and your team members arrive in time 🤞
22.06.23, 08:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love, sadly didn't dream about you either 🥲
Hope it goes well too 🤞🏻
22.06.23, 08:35 - Niki: *Night = love, sorry 😅
22.06.23, 08:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Before anything happens, so apparently a family member of mine died last night. I'll have to talk to my parents about the funeral which is probably going to be next week. My dad is probably not going to attend either, and they will also be leaving Belgium on Tuesday so it shouldn't matter too much, but I still wanted you to know in case. (For the record I was not close to her at all, which is why I'm so nonchalant about it)
22.06.23, 08:49 - Niki: Okay sorry for the lost. Yeah jo worries about something like that you can't control stuff like that.
22.06.23, 08:50 - Niki: Just asking when is your presentation over when can I ask you if it looks good or bad for the summer 😅
22.06.23, 08:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, she was in a coma for a while so we saw it coming, just didn't know when
22.06.23, 08:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It should be over at 14:30
22.06.23, 10:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out there have been 4 deaths within the families of my BAP group in just the last 2 weeks... This thing is fucking deadly
22.06.23, 10:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's not gonna be an issue with the funeral btw
22.06.23, 10:32 - Niki: Damm that's alot
22.06.23, 17:55 - Niki: Fuck i am a idiot forgot the presentation. How did it go?
22.06.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Totally gonna skip your message for a second sorry, I just got this notification and I don't like it, is this a sign?
22.06.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

22.06.23, 18:17 - Niki: Good but procrastination is take a hold of me
22.06.23, 18:17 - Niki: What are you up too?
22.06.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing much, just relaxing. Should probably pack my bags at some point
22.06.23, 18:18 - Niki: Yeah you should
22.06.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not gonna take long anyway
22.06.23, 18:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record, I don't need to bring my hiking shoes again right?
22.06.23, 18:38 - Niki: no i dont think you need them this time.
22.06.23, 19:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You wanna call for a bit later?

23.06.23, 07:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Waiting for my first train now
23.06.23, 07:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently it's a really old train, damn
23.06.23, 07:37 - Niki: Nice if you like old trains mabye it's like the Harry Potter train?
23.06.23, 07:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahha, not that old
23.06.23, 07:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: More like 80's old
23.06.23, 07:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably 90's
23.06.23, 07:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no clue how to estimate the styling choice age of a train
23.06.23, 07:41 - Niki: Same hope it gets you to Brüssel
23.06.23, 08:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think it will, older trains are more comfortable than newer ones anyway
23.06.23, 08:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My fucking train was cancelled
23.06.23, 08:11 - Niki: The one In Brussels?
23.06.23, 08:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, the one to frankfurt
23.06.23, 08:12 - Niki: Any plan?
23.06.23, 08:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently I'm now supposed to take a whole fucking round tour
23.06.23, 08:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I definitely won't be on time for my train in Frankfurt
23.06.23, 08:12 - Niki: Aaaaaah fuck

23.06.23, 08:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We'll see
23.06.23, 08:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still have to talk to the people
23.06.23, 08:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay so I'm taking a train to Aachen
23.06.23, 08:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And from there I'm supposed to ask them how to get to Leipzig
23.06.23, 08:20 - Niki: Okay sound liks a plan. i guess?
23.06.23, 08:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess?
23.06.23, 08:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is stressing me the fuck out 😅
23.06.23, 08:21 - Niki: If you need help or wanna reduce your stress. You can call me anytime

23.06.23, 08:34 - Niki: ?
23.06.23, 08:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The sugar bread thingy
23.06.23, 08:35 - Niki: For å sec I thought you had a good breakfast
23.06.23, 08:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
23.06.23, 08:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Rude
23.06.23, 08:36 - Niki: Sorry but it's not healthy at all
23.06.23, 08:36 - Niki: But it's a start
23.06.23, 08:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I know, it's not like I eat it every day you know?
23.06.23, 08:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's literally like twice a year or something
23.06.23, 08:36 - Niki: I know sorry didn't want to make you feel bad
23.06.23, 08:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, you couldn't make me feel worse than I already feel right now
23.06.23, 08:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Unless you suddenly decide to break up with me I guess
23.06.23, 08:38 - Niki: Never hon. If I do something is wrong with me please help me then
23.06.23, 08:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, sure thing 😘
23.06.23, 08:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That goes 2 ways though
23.06.23, 09:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I completely forgot how pretty this station is
23.06.23, 09:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Liège is so pretty, it's crazy, especially in the sunlight
23.06.23, 09:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's really colourful
23.06.23, 09:32 - Niki: Sounds great sadly never been there. When do you arrive in Aachen by the way?
23.06.23, 09:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 10:56 normally
23.06.23, 09:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: From there I can probably take a train to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Leipzig
23.06.23, 10:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Waiting for a train again
23.06.23, 10:01 - Niki: Sucks
23.06.23, 10:01 - Niki: But your entertainment is good?
23.06.23, 10:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's alright, would be nicer to have you to entertain me in real life 😘
23.06.23, 10:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have to wait here for another 25 minutes before the train to Aachen
23.06.23, 10:08 - Niki: Well will entertain you for the next 7 days 🥰
23.06.23, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Train came early
23.06.23, 10:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will probably stay here for another 20 minutes but at least I don't have to wait on a bench outside
23.06.23, 10:09 - Niki: Can get a nice sitting  place
23.06.23, 10:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's quite nice
23.06.23, 10:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ejjj, I'm in Germany
23.06.23, 10:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not to get to the other side of the country
23.06.23, 11:00 - Niki: Welcome in the country of beer and sausages
23.06.23, 11:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you, gonna go talk to the travel bureau now... You guys have tickets for this shit??
23.06.23, 11:04 - Niki: Yeah
23.06.23, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... ridiculous
23.06.23, 11:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gotta spend half an hour in Aachen now
23.06.23, 11:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There is a bookshop in the station...
23.06.23, 11:09 - Niki: You know what train to take next?
23.06.23, 11:09 - Niki: Please don't spend all you money
23.06.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, at 11:39 to Frankfurt, then from Frankfurt to Leipzig
23.06.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I won't
23.06.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not gonna buy anything probably
23.06.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's all in German
23.06.23, 11:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found the English books 😊
23.06.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Please explain to me why there's just as many books in english as there are in Italian and Spanish??
23.06.23, 11:15 - Niki: Well most older german people learned Italian, Spanish or Russian in school
23.06.23, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Russian I get, Spanish perhaps, but why the fuck Italian?
23.06.23, 11:17 - Niki: It's a nice holiday spot
23.06.23, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... why are all the stereotypes about German people true?
23.06.23, 11:18 - Niki: Well 😅
23.06.23, 11:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Looks like I'll be in Leipzig around 17:11
23.06.23, 11:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The train is late againnnn
23.06.23, 11:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't mind it that much though, means I have to spend less time in Frankfurt (theoretically)
23.06.23, 11:42 - Niki: Allways look at the thinks from a positive side 😅
23.06.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm sure trying
23.06.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What have you been doing/what are you up to?
23.06.23, 11:43 - Niki: Cleaning the bathroom nothing much
23.06.23, 11:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
23.06.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The train is so full 😭
23.06.23, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No seating spots left, guess I'll be standing for 2 hours
23.06.23, 11:56 - Niki: You have my condolences 😢
23.06.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks 👍
23.06.23, 12:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I concurred a seating spot! Eureka!
23.06.23, 12:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cologne looks like a nice city
23.06.23, 12:37 - Niki: Only driven past it but yeah what I hear of it
23.06.23, 12:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *Köln
23.06.23, 12:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same, but from what I'm seeing on the train it looks nice
23.06.23, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.06.23, 12:50 - Niki: Don't now if you could read it but it's a carneval train. Really nice
23.06.23, 12:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I saw it, looks pretty funny
23.06.23, 13:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Train is already 20 minutes delayed, if it delays even more I might even miss the train in Frankfurt...
23.06.23, 13:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is bullshit honestly
23.06.23, 13:08 - Niki: Yeah it's the german rail road system. Ever german hates it. But mabye your train in Frankfurt is delayed too. Actually likely to be honest
23.06.23, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: As far as I can see it is, thank god, but only by 7 minutes for now
23.06.23, 13:24 - Niki: Hope it works out 🤞🏻
23.06.23, 13:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We'll seeee
23.06.23, 13:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.06.23, 13:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hate it

23.06.23, 13:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh
23.06.23, 13:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hopefully
23.06.23, 13:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess I'll just wait another 2 hours or something for the next train, will see what happens
23.06.23, 13:31 - Niki: By the way we gone be in Leipzig tomorrow 16:00 till 17:30 for the escape room
23.06.23, 13:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, hope I'll be there by then 👍🏻
23.06.23, 13:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm really gonna be angry if I don't make that train
23.06.23, 13:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay I definitely am gonna miss that train unless by the will of some kind of spirit the other train is delayed by 20 fucking minutes
23.06.23, 13:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, so I miss this one
23.06.23, 13:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then I will take one an hour later that goes to Erfurt and then from there a train to Leipzig
23.06.23, 13:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should be in Leipzig around 18:11 then
23.06.23, 13:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pffttt
23.06.23, 13:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm tired
23.06.23, 13:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.06.23, 13:46 - Niki: I will huge for as long as you want to and we can take a long nap together no worries. Your doing great 😘
23.06.23, 13:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know I'm doing great I just want to be over with this and with you already 😭
23.06.23, 13:47 - Niki: Cutie 🥰
23.06.23, 14:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Arriving in Frankfurt... Where I will now be stuck for an hour
23.06.23, 14:16 - Niki: Still as shity as ever?
23.06.23, 14:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just arriving but yeah, I assume so
23.06.23, 14:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah Frankfurt still really fucking sucks
23.06.23, 14:25 - Niki: Something happened or just released it again?
23.06.23, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's just a shitty place
23.06.23, 14:27 - Niki: True yeah
23.06.23, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna eat my wrap now I think
23.06.23, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On the train to Erfurt, found a place to sit, hopefully this one isn't delayed
23.06.23, 14:58 - Niki: I pray for your safe and on time arrival 🙏🏼
23.06.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks, I probably need it
23.06.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: People speaking German to me 😶
23.06.23, 15:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I understand it but still
23.06.23, 15:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Taking advantage of my time to schedule a job interview on Wednesday morning because I still don't have a job :)
23.06.23, 15:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also heard an American explain the reservation system to a German... I'm pretty sure they're well aware of it and just don't give a damn
23.06.23, 15:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The way they kept saying "Oh, I've never heard of this, how should we reserve then?" And the American explaining to be helpful was quite funny
23.06.23, 15:37 - Niki: Sounds like a nice and entertaining train ride
23.06.23, 15:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, I'm in the kids' zone again so makes sense
23.06.23, 15:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will be in Erfurt at 17:09 normally, wait there for 20 minutes and then approximately half an hour to Leipzig
23.06.23, 15:57 - Niki: Nice
23.06.23, 15:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, 3 hours too late but yeah I guess
23.06.23, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 1 more hour if everything goes right this time
23.06.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, 1 hour and 15 minutes but potato patato
23.06.23, 17:29 - Niki: Yeah I am in Leipzig already. Any ideas for dinner?
23.06.23, 17:30 - Niki: Gone go shopping till your here
23.06.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, no clue
23.06.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also not hungry at this point so that doesn't help 😅
23.06.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just something light? Idk
23.06.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just entered the last train :)
23.06.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will be there in 40 minutes
23.06.23, 17:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I actually have to try not to fall asleep for once, that's... Not something that happens often
23.06.23, 17:50 - Niki: No worrys I think it's the last stop and I will get you 😘
23.06.23, 17:50 - Niki: When does the train arrive?
23.06.23, 17:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not, it's the train to Hamburg Altona
23.06.23, 17:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 18:10 apparently
23.06.23, 17:52 - Niki: Which train track?
23.06.23, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doesn't say
23.06.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll let you know if it does
23.06.23, 18:02 - Niki: Found it
23.06.23, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which is it? I still don't know 😂
23.06.23, 18:04 - Niki: 12
26.06.23, 10:44 - Niki: The hair dresser is at 12 😅
26.06.23, 10:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How did you mistake that??
26.06.23, 10:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So what's up now?
26.06.23, 10:46 - Niki: Don't know
26.06.23, 10:47 - Niki: Just taught she said 11 on the phone
26.06.23, 10:47 - Niki: Walking back now
26.06.23, 10:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It happens
26.06.23, 10:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You wanna go to the store first then or wait until after the hairdresser?
26.06.23, 10:51 - Niki: We can go to the store
27.06.23, 19:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe it would be nice to ask him for his contact details at the end of the conversation, he sounds like he knows something about what you're doing so it would be nice to be able to ask him questions about it in the future I think.
27.06.23, 19:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just an idea

01.07.23, 18:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... you're insane but okay
01.07.23, 18:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also we had a question. Do you know what the signs with a big red dot and then an arrow underneath or 'ende' mean?
01.07.23, 18:40 - Niki: Don't know where it was but it could be the Ende of the high way mabye
01.07.23, 18:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... Maybe, thanks! What are you up to? Hanging out in Leipzig?

01.07.23, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Police is here now
01.07.23, 19:12 - Niki: It could cost if the send somebody else but it's mostly free. I am a member there so mabye that helps
01.07.23, 19:12 - Niki: Good or bad?
01.07.23, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No clue
01.07.23, 19:12 - Niki: They will probably just  ask what's up?
01.07.23, 19:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good
01.07.23, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're calling a towtruck for us
01.07.23, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will probably be here in about 30 minutes
01.07.23, 19:18 - Niki: Fuck where are you by the way?
01.07.23, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Duisburg
01.07.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Better than I expected honestly, was afraid it would take hours
01.07.23, 19:19 - Niki: Oh okay so 3 /4more hours? If it gets going again
01.07.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh

01.07.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We might have to sleep here idk yet
01.07.23, 19:22 - Niki: Sucks still okayish mood sounds really shity
01.07.23, 19:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's alright, the police guy was really nice
01.07.23, 19:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently the insurance covers everything (or well, it should but we'll see)
01.07.23, 19:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now we're just gonna wait for the towtruck
01.07.23, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
01.07.23, 19:30 - Niki: That's a big hole 😬
01.07.23, 19:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp

01.07.23, 19:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The towtruck came to get us, he can fix the car on Monday
01.07.23, 20:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So we're at the towtruck place now, waiting for our insurance to come get us, which they told us will be in about 2 hours but it will probably take longer
01.07.23, 20:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The towtruck guys were really nice though, gave us water and all that
01.07.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, the mood went down a bit
01.07.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom made me cry, because we talked about yesterday evening and you and I just started crying in the middle of the street while we went to the gas station to get some food
01.07.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We now need to find a hotel and check if there are any trains for me to take home tomorrow
01.07.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The mood now is "we need to fix things now"
01.07.23, 21:50 - Niki: Sounds like a lot went to a underground minigolf courae
01.07.23, 21:51 - Niki: Hope you find a Train 🙏🏼
01.07.23, 21:51 - Niki: Hope you can relax abit in the hotel
01.07.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Finding a train isn't an issue... A hotel for tonight is pretty impossible though 😅

Good luck with studying 😘
My grandpa is going to come pick me up later this afternoon, no clue what is going to happen with the car. My parents are staying to see what happens with the car tomorrow, luckily they have their laptops with them so they can work
02.07.23, 13:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know I shouldn't bring it up again but it's kinda stuck in my head so yeah. I'm still really sorry about 2 days ago and I really fucking hate that I did that the day before we had to say goodbye. I love you way too much to ever want to put you through that kind of thing again. I'll improve on that, I promise. And I know you don't want me to say sorry again but idk, it's still stuck with me and I can't do anything to make it better aside from trying to improve myself on that level.
02.07.23, 13:43 - Niki: Okay hon love you 🥰.  Please don't think too much about it and I also realized that you can be sorry about so I was also at fault. Will improve together 😘
02.07.23, 13:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There was literally nothing you did wrong??
02.07.23, 13:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yeah, I'll try to move on from it now I guess 😅

04.07.23, 19:41 - Niki: Nice Sounds great hope she doesn't get stuff to do. How is it going with her crush/girl she went on a date with?
04.07.23, 19:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think it will be fine this time but we'll see
04.07.23, 19:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not going too well, apparently the girl isn't responding well or communicating at all 😅
04.07.23, 19:44 - Niki: Some people 😶 are not good with texting or calling just saying 😅.
04.07.23, 19:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I know, I also told her that, but she's literally not responding for more than 3 days 😅
04.07.23, 19:45 - Niki: 😶 This isn't the right emote for this just wanted to point out me
04.07.23, 19:45 - Niki: I know some people who do this but because of thinking and just forgetting not in a harmful way
04.07.23, 19:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh, I know hon, but you've actually improved so much it's insane ❤️
04.07.23, 19:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would say you're quite good at it now 😘
04.07.23, 19:46 - Niki: Thanks you make me blush a bit you know that 😊
04.07.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know I know, but Alex asked to set up a new date and she seems to be trying to avoid it idk? It's kinda weird, I'm not saying it's in purpose but Alex clarified and there still wasn't really a good response
04.07.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie ❤️
04.07.23, 19:49 - Niki: You never know the full story but it kinda sounds sketchy from her(not Alex ) side. Will see i geuss
04.07.23, 19:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's true, we'll see what happens, Alex is gonna try to set up a date one more time and we'll see what happens
04.07.23, 19:52 - Niki: Sounds good hope she is not too sad about it mabye try to cheer her up if it doesn't work? Mabye get jinte with you
04.07.23, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think she's fine, she said she doesn't feel too bad because they only went on one date. Jinte is in Italy now btw. But yeah, definitely meeting up on Saturday to hang out
04.07.23, 20:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Finished calling Alex, was so long since we last talked 😅
Hope you're still doing fine my love ❤️

04.07.23, 20:35 - Niki: sorry but its something we need to talk and not text
04.07.23, 20:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh, I get it, just saying that I'm too curious and now I'll be thinking what it could be until then. Actually thank you, now I have something interesting to do tomorrow at work

05.07.23, 17:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going love?
05.07.23, 17:55 - Niki: Procrastination is today my main purpose in life. I don't know why I do something but not for long mabye like 2 hour out of 6 it sucks 🥲

09.07.23, 21:58 - Niki: Nachhaltigkeit
09.07.23, 23:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out Alex's friend went to the festival after all... Still hasn't responded to Alex's messages apologising and explaining the situation though... She's supposed to come along on Friday, not sure how I feel about it now 😅
09.07.23, 23:12 - Niki: Sounds like a shit show to be honest. Kinda the same thing with Alex last time just ignore it I geuss. I think you two are in the right
09.07.23, 23:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I guess so, I just know Alex hates it because now we're supposed to meet up on Friday and with her being pissed off, we don't know if she's even gonna show up or anything
09.07.23, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And Alex is a bit of a pushover apologising to her, but I guess I get it, they've been friends since they were 3 I guess
10.07.23, 00:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
10.07.23, 10:24 - Niki: Good morning Hon hope have a good day 😘

10.07.23, 18:02 - Niki: Okay so now just relaxing or what are you up too?

11.07.23, 00:06 - Niki: yeah i will
11.07.23, 00:06 - Niki: no worries
11.07.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey

11.07.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's just a nice to have
11.07.23, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk how else to explain it

11.07.23, 08:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Morning my love, hope you had a great night 😘
11.07.23, 08:17 - Niki: Yeah a beautiful dream about the two of us going on a date and just having a great time 🥰
11.07.23, 08:18 - Niki: Hope you also had a good night of sleep
11.07.23, 08:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie 🥰
Sounds like a great dream!
11.07.23, 08:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, was alright, didn't dream about you though 🥲
11.07.23, 08:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question, is saying good morning to your bus driver a thing in Germany? Or do you think that's just weird?
11.07.23, 08:30 - Niki: Most people say it but it's not mandatory(more on the countryside). Also no thanks at the end of a ride.
11.07.23, 08:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel like saying good morning is pretty common here, but saying goodbye is a bit more difficult because you get out from the back so you don't see the driver again
11.07.23, 08:33 - Niki: yeah same
11.07.23, 09:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently I worked too much last week so I have to work 15 minutes less this week 😂
11.07.23, 09:38 - Niki: Nice busy bee 😊
11.07.23, 12:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kissing the homies is 110% totally fine, however I will be jealous of the fact they get to kiss you and I don't 🥲😘
11.07.23, 12:41 - Niki: Okay get that nn worries i like kiss you way more 😘
11.07.23, 12:42 - Niki: How is work going? Which podcast are you listing too
11.07.23, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You better 😘
11.07.23, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's going alright, listening to rSlash now, Reddit stories
11.07.23, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
11.07.23, 12:50 - Niki: pretty good. Driving home to my parents till the weekend soon
11.07.23, 12:51 - Niki: Nice but its kinda sad that some of them are fake and just for fame  there
11.07.23, 12:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, true, but they're still pretty entertaining for the most part, even if fake
11.07.23, 12:55 - Niki: yeah
11.07.23, 12:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you have a good time at your parents'! 😊
11.07.23, 12:56 - Niki: Yeah will mostly studie there i thinnk but will seee

11.07.23, 18:23 - Niki: We driving to Fabian to visit him. We are supprised it only 2 and half hour
11.07.23, 18:23 - Niki: What are you up too hon?
11.07.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, cool! 2,5 hours only? Damn, that's not long
11.07.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna take a boat ride for Cato's birthday, we're waiting for them now
11.07.23, 18:32 - Niki: Oh yeah right happy birthday from me by the way
11.07.23, 18:32 - Niki: Sounds nice is it inside Ghent?
11.07.23, 18:44 - Niki: Kinda love these "spontaneously" trips 😅
11.07.23, 18:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, in the centre of Ghent
11.07.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I get why, they sound a lot of fun, wish I could do some of those too, but my friends and spontaneous trips are not a great combination I'm afraid 😅
11.07.23, 18:48 - Niki: Yeah you will and yeah but I think it could work
11.07.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe some day, Alex and I probably could but Jinte definitely not 😅
11.07.23, 19:02 - Niki: I think she just need a small push. But you could also kidnap her 😶
11.07.23, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now THAT is an idea
11.07.23, 19:09 - Niki: How is the party? How old did she get
11.07.23, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 19, party is great :)
11.07.23, 19:14 - Niki: Them don't know why but she seems younger. No offense
11.07.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahah, I won't tell them you think that 😂
11.07.23, 19:23 - Niki: Mean you could do it. Don't think she will take it the wrong way. Just saying
11.07.23, 19:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably not, but most people think they're older because of how tall they are
11.07.23, 19:38 - Niki: Yeah understandable
11.07.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
11.07.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Some footage from the boat ride
11.07.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you're having a good time 😊
12.07.23, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
12.07.23, 00:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you, hope you are alright
12.07.23, 00:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You better still be alive and either sleeping or having a good time
12.07.23, 01:43 - Niki: Having a good time but my phone died
12.07.23, 01:44 - Niki: Goodnight ❤️
12.07.23, 04:46 - Niki: We drove home now there Goodnight ❤️
12.07.23, 04:47 - Niki: Hope there were some captain jokes look really nice
12.07.23, 08:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should have assumed so
12.07.23, 08:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, not that many really
12.07.23, 08:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're fucking insane for driving back home but okay
12.07.23, 08:59 - Niki: Good morning I can't sleep because my parents guest bedroom / my old room is in the most sunny and warm room in here 🥲.
12.07.23, 08:59 - Niki: How was your night Hon 🥰 and already at work?
12.07.23, 09:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you can still rest a little 🥲
12.07.23, 09:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I slept terribly 😅, all I want to do is get back to bed honestly but yeah, I'm at work now
12.07.23, 09:12 - Niki: Feel the same but can't it's too hot so studying yeah 🥲
12.07.23, 09:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dude, you've only slept like 3 hours 😅
12.07.23, 09:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How the fuck are you going to study?
12.07.23, 09:26 - Niki: No idea but I can't sleep
12.07.23, 09:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, happened to both of us today then 😅
Though the reasons are probably very different
12.07.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't force yourself too much
12.07.23, 09:28 - Niki: Yeah seems like it. I would do but thanks for worrying hon 🥰. Love you 😘
12.07.23, 09:29 - Niki: What's your reason why you slept terrible by the way?
12.07.23, 09:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't laugh at me
12.07.23, 09:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was worried you got into a car crash or something because you didn't respond but the messages were delivered and because it was so late my anxiety just ran with it 😅
12.07.23, 09:33 - Niki: Oh hon i am sorry. From now on I try to write you befor my phone dies so you don't need to worry. I am sorry and your really cute 🥹
12.07.23, 09:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no, it's not your fault, I'm just overdramatic
12.07.23, 09:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honestly should have assumed your phone died, but because it delivered I was confused and didn't know what was going on 😅
12.07.23, 09:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out that's a thing with whatsapp
12.07.23, 09:38 - Niki: No your worrying about me and yeah mabye a bit much but it's your good write to do so.
12.07.23, 09:38 - Niki: Yeah it's weird some times
12.07.23, 09:39 - Niki: *Right
12.07.23, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, maybe
12.07.23, 09:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I personally think it's a bit too much
12.07.23, 09:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently my grandparents and aunt + Pieter are in Bergen now... I'm jealous
12.07.23, 09:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Happy for them
12.07.23, 09:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I wanna go back 😅
12.07.23, 09:54 - Niki: Happy form them too but yeah also jealous
12.07.23, 09:54 - Niki: Same
12.07.23, 13:49 - Niki: What are you up too hon 🥰?
12.07.23, 14:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Work, as usual, what are you up to? 😘
12.07.23, 14:45 - Niki: Just studying at my parents house and talk with them and if they have some time
12.07.23, 15:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the studying going? Not too tired?
12.07.23, 15:03 - Niki: It's fine kinda procrastinating but not too much. Probably gone take a nap soon
12.07.23, 16:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you have a good nap ❤️
12.07.23, 16:53 - Niki: Great nap only 20~30 min but great 🥰
12.07.23, 16:53 - Niki: Going home now?
12.07.23, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, on the bus
12.07.23, 16:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was wearing my pimp suit pants today and goddamn, I'm 100% sure I lost weight since coming back from Norway and I have absolutely no clue how or why. That or I messed up washing the pants and they became bigger... But I don't think so
12.07.23, 16:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm glad you had a good nap 😘
12.07.23, 16:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, you ever heard of a singer called LEA?
12.07.23, 16:57 - Niki: Nope is she german?
12.07.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, some of her songs seem to be quite well known too, or maybe that's because of the artists she collaborates with idk
12.07.23, 16:58 - Niki: Well that's a good think or a bad think? Also I have no idea how much one needs to fuck up to shrink clothing. Its impossible I tried with a extra large t-shirt 😅
12.07.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://open.spotify.com/artist/5Yo5iU2nf4H41waPl4ZnS1?si=HdaIhfnkS02-NsvyrP9utQ
12.07.23, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no, not shrink, grow!
12.07.23, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no clue if it's good or bad honestly
12.07.23, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It just is?
12.07.23, 16:59 - Niki: I didn't notice to be honest
12.07.23, 16:59 - Niki: Okay yeah get that
12.07.23, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now I kinda want to try to shrink something in the wash just because you said it's hard
12.07.23, 17:00 - Niki: She a a big colab with a rapper but not my style
12.07.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've noticed my pants aren't as tight fitting as they used to be, some of them kinda fall off a little bit, but yeah, makes sense you wouldn't notice that, you only see the top of my body usually 😅
12.07.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
12.07.23, 17:00 - Niki: I tried like multiple times to wash a t-shirt with 60° and it didn't shrink
12.07.23, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... I guess it also depends on the fabric the shirt was made from?
12.07.23, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk really know
12.07.23, 17:01 - Niki: Same
12.07.23, 17:01 - Niki: Idk 😅
12.07.23, 17:02 - Niki: Any plans for the rest of this beautiful day?
12.07.23, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, help my mom with accounting and probably clean up my room a bit, oh, and I probably should cook dinner too...
12.07.23, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What about you?
12.07.23, 17:03 - Niki: Studying and helping my mom too with cleaning and house chores 😊
12.07.23, 17:04 - Niki: If I can ask what exactly do you do to help your mom?
12.07.23, 17:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's kinda difficult to explain in a text so that's gonna be a voice message, sorry
12.07.23, 17:06 - Niki: No problem I can hear your beautiful voice that's a win for me 🥰
12.07.23, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
12.07.23, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
12.07.23, 17:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But my voice is very meh 😅
12.07.23, 17:09 - Niki: Not for me it's really nice. I don't know how to discribe it but it feels nice and warm.
12.07.23, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 🫣
12.07.23, 17:10 - Niki: Okay nice sounds, well boring but nice that you can help your mom
12.07.23, 17:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honestly not that boring, I get to learn a lot about how people try to commit tax fraud
12.07.23, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Actually I think I get it because it's similar for me with your voice. Hearing you just instantly makes me happy
12.07.23, 17:23 - Niki: Make me blush a bit ☺️
12.07.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are you doing anything right now?
12.07.23, 17:31 - Niki: Should study but no not really
12.07.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wanna call for a couple of minutes?
12.07.23, 17:31 - Niki: Yeah we can call 🥰
12.07.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ready?
12.07.23, 17:31 - Niki: Yeah
12.07.23, 17:39 - Niki: She is in a hurry?
12.07.23, 17:40 - Niki: Or just always a bit cryptic with the messages
12.07.23, 17:40 - Niki: Sorry what
12.07.23, 17:40 - Niki: Will do
12.07.23, 17:41 - Niki: Gone call you again in 5 mins okay?
12.07.23, 18:27 - Niki: It kinda escalated between my parents and we are now taking a walk.
12.07.23, 18:27 - Niki: Sorry
12.07.23, 18:28 - Niki: I haven't seen a "fight like this in a while
12.07.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, no worries! Hope they won't stay mad
12.07.23, 18:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy the walk, if you can 😅
12.07.23, 18:30 - Niki: Trying too
12.07.23, 18:30 - Niki: xD
12.07.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will take this time to cook :)
12.07.23, 18:38 - Niki: Work a company together is hard
12.07.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah... Yes, that's a fact
12.07.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If my parents argue about anything it's usually that too
12.07.23, 18:41 - Niki: Yeah it's awful sometimes and over small thinks too it's crazy
12.07.23, 18:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, working together is difficult, my parents (mostly my dad) really enjoy it though, it's not all bad
12.07.23, 18:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess they appreciate it a lot because in the past they both had really demanding jobs that made it so they couldn't see eachother for weeks, even when they already lived together
12.07.23, 18:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now they work together and they fight occasionally, but they can see eachother every day
12.07.23, 18:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They even used to have a small book they wrote notes in to each other, it's really cute
12.07.23, 18:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yeah, it's definitely stressful and annoying sometimes
12.07.23, 18:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope your parents make up soon (during the walk preferably)
12.07.23, 18:57 - Niki: Yeah seems good
12.07.23, 18:58 - Niki: Really cute
12.07.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good 🥳
12.07.23, 19:00 - Niki: We are now at the graveyard
12.07.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice??
12.07.23, 19:02 - Niki: It has a weird positiv vibe
12.07.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I get that
12.07.23, 19:38 - Niki: Okay we are back home and everything is back to normal
12.07.23, 19:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, that's good, I'm glad they made up
12.07.23, 19:57 - Niki: Now we sit around and talk alot. It's really nice
12.07.23, 20:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds pretty nice 😊
12.07.23, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: All 3 of us are now doing accounting together, somehow it's also quite nice 😅
12.07.23, 20:20 - Niki: Nice family time sounds good
12.07.23, 20:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, there's better things to do together but it's surprisingly okay
12.07.23, 20:21 - Niki: Hey your alle having a good time

12.07.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I get that, fights in general are tiring as hell
12.07.23, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wish we could continue our call but unfortunately not possible
12.07.23, 21:02 - Niki: Can you read my mind😳. I was typing that right now if you wanna too?

12.07.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean a fuss though? I wanna know more
12.07.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's apparently my mom's favourite part of accounting which she isn't allowed to do anymore, but I don't like it that much so far 😅
12.07.23, 21:25 - Niki: I said she couldn't have it but then she ask for it with please so I gave it to here and I got it back now.
12.07.23, 21:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're a cutie
12.07.23, 21:25 - Niki: What are you doing exactly

15.07.23, 09:25 - Niki: Woke up early than I thought. When is Anthony and Aeneas there?
15.07.23, 09:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I was awake around 7:47 too but that was wayyy too early for me so I went back to sleep
15.07.23, 09:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They should be arriving in 30 minutes
15.07.23, 09:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So that means I have just enough time for a shower and a cup of tea to actually wake up 👍
15.07.23, 09:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How come you're awake so early?
15.07.23, 09:28 - Niki: Need to Study use the time 😅
15.07.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooff, how's that going?

15.07.23, 14:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
15.07.23, 14:14 - Niki: Hehe so Anthony and jinte go together 😂

15.07.23, 19:15 - Niki: Wish you all a great time at the gentse feesten
15.07.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
15.07.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love, hate that you can't be here though
15.07.23, 19:21 - Niki: Looks good i don't know why but I thought jinte could do it 😅
15.07.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Disappointingly she couldn't and is still struggling
15.07.23, 20:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're going there now 😊
15.07.23, 20:50 - Niki: Hope you have fun 🥰
15.07.23, 20:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon, hope you have a nice evening too 😘
15.07.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are you still gonna study or relax a bit?
15.07.23, 20:57 - Niki: Study and making food soon
15.07.23, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Make yourself some good food ❤️
16.07.23, 01:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
16.07.23, 03:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got home, goodnight ❤️
16.07.23, 08:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon, hope you had a good night 😘
16.07.23, 08:55 - Niki: Good morning my love hope your night was good as well even if it was short 😘
16.07.23, 08:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, idk why but I just woke up for some reason 😅
16.07.23, 08:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty sure everyone else is still asleep
16.07.23, 08:57 - Niki: Better be quit 🤫 then hope they can sleep abit longer
16.07.23, 08:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, not trying to wake everyone up 😅
16.07.23, 08:58 - Niki: Any plans for today? And how was yesterday night?
16.07.23, 08:58 - Niki: Did Alex come along yesterday?
16.07.23, 08:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tonight going back to Gentse Feesten, but this time I think it's only for a burlesque performance, after that I'm gonna go home and sleep 💤
I'm gonna go again tomorrow so I fucking need it 😅
16.07.23, 09:00 - Niki: Gentse feste is life right now 😅
16.07.23, 09:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yesterday was nice, but I guess some parts of it were slightly ruined by some things that happened, I hope Anthony and Aeneas had a good time though, even if Anthony really wanted to drink more, kinda happy he didn't
16.07.23, 09:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, but only until 12:30 I think, because otherwise their phone would have died and their orientation is absolute shit, so if the phone died would have been difficult for them to get home
16.07.23, 09:02 - Niki: What happend?
16.07.23, 09:02 - Niki: Yeah but I think they would have survived
16.07.23, 09:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uh... Well, some guy got too close while I was handing back some glasses, so that kinda sucked, also kinda scared me a little how fast Anthony was ready to fight the guy once I got back, but he was gone already
16.07.23, 09:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then you remember the elephant hats?
16.07.23, 09:03 - Niki: By the way I love Aeneas for taking pictures of you because than I can see your beautiful face. (The magic picture and the one with jinte yesterday)
16.07.23, 09:04 - Niki: Yeah
16.07.23, 09:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently a lot of people wanted them and made it into a game of trying to steal them
16.07.23, 09:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This in combination with Anthony and Aeneas (especially the first one) and alcohol made it so I had to de-escalate a situation that might have led to a fight at the end of the night
16.07.23, 09:05 - Niki: Like how close and I am proud of Anthony. Even though violence is never a good option
16.07.23, 09:05 - Niki: Love that oh well every thing went well I geuss 😅
16.07.23, 09:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just like, idk how to explain but he was almost pressing against my back when that really wasn't fucking necessary
16.07.23, 09:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kept his hands to himself though, but still
16.07.23, 09:07 - Niki: Mhhh okay
16.07.23, 09:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can pass off random people touching me in a big crowd because it happens and I'd rather not think of it any wrong way, but that guy got too close and kinda ruined my mood
16.07.23, 09:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... It happened like 3 time, I think the first two were on Aeneas and they both already got annoyed at that time, so the third time before I could even react Anthony had the guy on the floor, Aeneas was shoving him and I was just pulling them back trying to fix it
16.07.23, 09:09 - Niki: Yeah understandable. Really annoying but hope you still had a nice night
16.07.23, 09:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, no worries, I think Aeneas has a video that shows me dancing (and falling) with Jinte like right after
16.07.23, 09:09 - Niki: Jesus Damm well the had is really nice
16.07.23, 09:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And fucking expensive
16.07.23, 09:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 25 euros!!
16.07.23, 09:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could have also won it, but they both suck at throwing 😂
16.07.23, 09:10 - Niki: Well the pink olifant is worth it
16.07.23, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess so!
16.07.23, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You want some pictures/videos?
16.07.23, 09:11 - Niki: Yes
16.07.23, 09:11 - Niki: How was the meet up between jinte and THE FRENCH
16.07.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're cute, I really wish you were there ❤️
I think he has more pictures that he hasn't sent yet
16.07.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh dear
16.07.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, she already met Aeneas like twice so that was fine
16.07.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And meeting Anthony somehow they acted like they knew each other for a lifetime
16.07.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They share the same brain cells for sure
16.07.23, 09:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also can not count the amount of times where Jinte threatened to kill Anthony
16.07.23, 09:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (jokingly of course)
16.07.23, 09:13 - Niki: Nice sounds great so they did weird shit and then after a while annoyed you a lot

16.07.23, 11:12 - Niki: Poor jinte
16.07.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean? She decides to leave early herself
16.07.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not kicking her out or anything 😂
16.07.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or you wanna call her too? ;)
16.07.23, 11:13 - Niki: Okay she probably has alot to do
16.07.23, 11:14 - Niki: Nah just sounded like she gets kick out
16.07.23, 11:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She has to help her brother's girlfriend with something before tomorrow

16.07.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you didn't mind seeing all the pictures and videos too much and not being here, I know it sucks having to study and seeing all that.
16.07.23, 18:08 - Niki: No worry's I love too see them
16.07.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, that good 😊
16.07.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the studying going btw?
16.07.23, 18:17 - Niki: Okayish need to study way more 😅
16.07.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna be a long night or you're gonna go to sleep at 10 like you said earlier?
16.07.23, 18:18 - Niki: I lied its gone be a bit longer 😅
16.07.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhu, I figured, please get some decent sleep though, you'll need to be able to think the whole day tomorrow
16.07.23, 18:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for not lying to me about that btw
16.07.23, 18:24 - Niki: No worrys I am trying to be honest most of the time
16.07.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I swear to god if you do the same shit as Alex where she only lies to me to make me less worried I'll be severely annoyed. But thank you, I really value that you're honest to me
16.07.23, 18:27 - Niki: Won't do that for big thinks
16.07.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, I don't care if it's big or small, I just care about you
16.07.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That sounds like I'm talking about your penis but anyway
16.07.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: "that's what she said"
16.07.23, 18:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean it though, if you lie because you don't want me to nag about shit like eating dinner, just tell me to tone it down on that level and I'll try to keep it to myself, if it's because you don't want me to worry about you? Too late, I'll always worry :) that's just who I am
16.07.23, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, I hope you're okay, I wish I could give you a hug and cook you a good breakfast for your exams tomorrow, as well as snacks and dinner for today, however all I can do now is wish you luck and perseverance to get the studying done 😘
I know you can do it
16.07.23, 18:39 - Niki: Okay don't mind you nagging me to be honest
16.07.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope not, a lifetime is a very long time to hear it
16.07.23, 18:42 - Niki: Cutie 🥰
16.07.23, 21:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you're doing good 😘
16.07.23, 22:10 - Niki: Yeah went for a walk with the others
16.07.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice
16.07.23, 23:04 - Niki: How is the party(strip dance think I don't kown the name) with your mom
16.07.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Burlesque! It was so good!!! If you're here next year (I'm hoping so) we're 100% going together, it was incredible
16.07.23, 23:07 - Niki: Okay like a promise 🥰
16.07.23, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes 😊

16.07.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What about you? Still studying or going to sleep soon?
16.07.23, 23:31 - Niki: Sleeping soon like a hour more studying for me
16.07.23, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's not too bad, hope you can concentrate that long and that it doesn't accidentally end up in 2am 😘
16.07.23, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I see you're on the story of phase games 😂

18.07.23, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh how I wish I could hug you right now
18.07.23, 20:34 - Niki: Same
18.07.23, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Who allowed you to look so attractive and be so far away? Absolutely unfair
18.07.23, 20:40 - Niki: oh honey
18.07.23, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Your smile is also very cute
18.07.23, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh honey what?
18.07.23, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://open.spotify.com/track/3BiTSDAHDZeQSJEwM9EprI?si=abWq2mieT0yBdu3dyrNqHQ
19.07.23, 00:21 - Niki: Great song fits my mood right now. Miss you so much hon 😢
19.07.23, 00:22 - Niki: Gonna go to sleep soon so I can I dream off you ❤️
19.07.23, 00:24 - Niki: Wanna call tomorrow after lunch or some other time? Or in the evening?
19.07.23, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes
19.07.23, 00:26 - Niki: Please write me what's ever on your mind right now
19.07.23, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm too fucking emotional and over thinking right now
19.07.23, 00:26 - Niki: Tell me more we can also call now if you wanna to?
19.07.23, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I'm not sure I can talk about it, it's complicated to me
19.07.23, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just really fucking miss you
19.07.23, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I realised it's probably another month before we see each other again
19.07.23, 00:29 - Niki: I would love to hug you right now even if it's only for a few seconds
19.07.23, 00:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And it kinda frustrates me that sometimes I feel too 'desperate' or needy
19.07.23, 00:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same
19.07.23, 00:30 - Niki: You are not 'desperate' /need. I got the same feeling. I also have no idea how to deal with it.
19.07.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also don't want to bother you too much during your exams so you don't have to deal with any more stress by thinking you should pay more attention to me or anything like that. Exams go first, so please don't take this conversation for that
19.07.23, 00:33 - Niki: I won't and I would procrastinat anyways. I would rather procrastinat with you then with any think else in the world. You also help me to study with your text and when we call it also kinda helps.
19.07.23, 00:34 - Niki: You are a real cutie and my love for you only grows each day ❤️
19.07.23, 00:35 - Niki: Please tell me what every you wanna say 🙏🏼
19.07.23, 00:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you so much, but it hurts so much too.
You're 100% worth it, it just fucking sucks sometimes
19.07.23, 00:37 - Niki: I will try my best to help you with the pain and we will get trough this long distance together 🥰
19.07.23, 00:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: As long as you know I'll be there for you too, pain or no pain. We'll do this together ❤️
19.07.23, 00:39 - Niki: My heart hurts that I can't kiss you /your forehead right now 🥲
19.07.23, 00:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm happy that whatever I do helps you, I just wasn't so sure about that before and the last thing I would want is for you to get annoyed because I keep telling you to eat well 😅
19.07.23, 00:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd love to just see you in real life, I'd be absolutely delighted to touch you
19.07.23, 00:40 - Niki: No hon no it helps and I love every text from you. It makes my dad I just get energy/happiness from them and I love the text ❤️
19.07.23, 00:40 - Niki: *day
19.07.23, 00:41 - Niki: Trust me if I say I won't nothing more right now than to touch and kiss you.
19.07.23, 00:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know that's the same for your messages right? My day starts off great if I woke up to a message from you 😊 and you don't know how much better it makes me feel to get a message through the day
19.07.23, 00:43 - Niki: I knew it already but hearing it from you again makes me really happy 😊
19.07.23, 00:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm happy when you're happy
19.07.23, 00:44 - Niki: Same for me and your a real cutie

19.07.23, 00:45 - Niki: Love you ❤️
19.07.23, 00:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you too ❤️
19.07.23, 00:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The fact that you knew I was overthinking though
19.07.23, 00:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Impressive
19.07.23, 00:47 - Niki: Well I would say I know you a bit now
19.07.23, 00:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd say so yeah, sometimes I feel like you know me better than I know you, but I want to know everything
19.07.23, 00:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just very forgetful, I need to start writing things down 😅🥲
19.07.23, 00:49 - Niki: I love to hear that and know worries I will tell. How often you wanna hear it. I love to know anything about you too 🥰 and I will forget too 😅

21.07.23, 01:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, got home, gonna go to sleep now
21.07.23, 01:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
21.07.23, 02:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I also got the privilege to Watch a recently divorced lesbian seduce 2 men (very successful might I say). Very entertaining. It is also very interesting to note that this is one of Jinte's mom's best friends and we were hanging out with them at a bar at this point
21.07.23, 11:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yo, what up hon?
21.07.23, 11:36 - Niki: Nothing much just woke up and sitting down for breakfast /lunch
21.07.23, 11:36 - Niki: How was your night did you get any sleep and what happened to the cat you caught?
21.07.23, 11:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy your food 😘
21.07.23, 11:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna go find out exactly that
21.07.23, 11:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got about 5 hours of sleep, could be worse
21.07.23, 11:37 - Niki: That's not good but atleast you had a great evening yesterday
21.07.23, 11:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No one is home
21.07.23, 11:39 - Niki: It's so weird when you wake up and nobody is home
21.07.23, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I did not have the video of the cat, I would 100% think it was a dream
21.07.23, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Everything is back in place
21.07.23, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It really is weird yeay
21.07.23, 11:40 - Niki: Mabye you had your phone in your dream
21.07.23, 11:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... why can't I have a teleportation device in my sleep then? Much more useful
21.07.23, 11:40 - Niki: Yeah I wish you had
21.07.23, 11:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently they found the owners so the cat is back there now
21.07.23, 11:42 - Niki: Good job. Better than keeping because it got a small wound 😜
21.07.23, 11:43 - Niki: No but the other people where stupid not gonna lie
21.07.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They really were
21.07.23, 15:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
21.07.23, 15:26 - Niki: I am just procrastinating 😭. I hate it how is your day going?
21.07.23, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Come on love, you can do it 😘 get something done so you can be proud of yourself tonight ❤️
21.07.23, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My day's going well, drove the car and now we're on a small hike, it's very beautiful 😊
21.07.23, 15:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
21.07.23, 15:34 - Niki: Ahh cutie hope you have on the hike
21.07.23, 19:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's studying going schat?
21.07.23, 19:09 - Niki: Schatz?
21.07.23, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess that is the German translation
21.07.23, 19:10 - Niki: Going great to be honest after your text I got some motivation and be on it for 1:30 hours
21.07.23, 19:10 - Niki: It's the same language but I love it 😘
21.07.23, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's great, better continue in that case 😘 ( or eat dinner, idk)

21.07.23, 19:12 - Niki: What are you up too is the hike over?
21.07.23, 19:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope dinner is nice 😋
21.07.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, we also went to visit my grandma and just got home now, I think we're doing dinner and maybe I'll go out tonight but only for 1 performance with Cato at 11:30, I'm tired as hell so I want sleep 😅
21.07.23, 19:15 - Niki: Dinner sounds great and don't over do it but the performance with Cato sounds nice. Hope you get some good sleep tonight
21.07.23, 19:16 - Niki: You know when Aeneas wanna come over tomorrow?
21.07.23, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks schat ;)
21.07.23, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Round the same time as last week I think, he should be in Ghent around 9:30
21.07.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you still get something productive done today (unless you're happy with what you did in that case good job 😘)
21.07.23, 19:19 - Niki: no gonna get somethings done
21.07.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck 🍀❤️
21.07.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you

21.07.23, 21:36 - Niki: https://www.forgemytrip.com/
21.07.23, 21:37 - Niki: that could be helpfull at one point
21.07.23, 21:37 - Niki: You went out by the way ?
21.07.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not yet, will see what Cato says once their work is over
21.07.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda hoping Cato doesn't want to go out
21.07.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, this is the AI right? I saw it a while ago! You tried it?
21.07.23, 21:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I just tried it and it looks pretty nice, but to have the 'full' experience apparently you need to pay so that kinda sucks
21.07.23, 22:08 - Niki: Yeah but it can give us some ideas I geuss
21.07.23, 22:09 - Niki: Yeah it's getting kinda late hope it work out
21.07.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, yesterday I went out around now too sooo, not that big of a difference I think
21.07.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True!
21.07.23, 22:24 - Niki: Just hope you get your good hours of sleep
21.07.23, 22:24 - Niki: Miss you 😘
21.07.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you too 🥺
21.07.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you, I hope you do too ❤️
21.07.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One thing I do have to say about going out so often is that once I get home I am so tired I can't think about how much I miss you for too long because I simply fall asleep 😅❤️
21.07.23, 22:36 - Niki: Well looks like I need to go out more too 😅. No but I like that you can fall asleep easier 😘
21.07.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, you're going out tomorrow, that's something 😅
21.07.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, btw, did you know Anthony's sleep issues are completely solved???
21.07.23, 22:37 - Niki: No i didn't what happened
21.07.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently he just needed (blue filter) glasses and eye drops and now he sleeps like a baby and falls asleep in an instant
21.07.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's insane
21.07.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm so happy for him
21.07.23, 22:38 - Niki: Nice yeah sounds great sometimes you just have to try some things
21.07.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, who knew glasses would do the trick? But yeah, it's great :)
21.07.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to now?
21.07.23, 23:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still haven't heard from Cato so I think I will just go to sleep
22.07.23, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight schat ❤️
22.07.23, 01:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe a very random question but is 'post nut clarity' actually a thing? I'm just curious
22.07.23, 01:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My bed doesn't smell like you and I hate it
22.07.23, 01:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why can't I sleep 😭
22.07.23, 08:13 - Niki: Gone sleeping like instantly I don't know how
22.07.23, 08:14 - Niki: It is
22.07.23, 08:15 - Niki: Good morning my love hope you sleep well and get your 8 hours of sleep 😘
22.07.23, 08:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm very jealous to say the least 😅, but also very happy you got some good sleep 😘
22.07.23, 08:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Interesting.... Definitely not the case for women
22.07.23, 08:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon ❤️

22.07.23, 19:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just used to eat a lot, I'm pretty sure it's just because I quit growing so now I need less food + it's summer so that doesn't help my hunger

24.07.23, 16:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, basically
24.07.23, 16:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It looks pretty much exactly like before 😂
24.07.23, 16:41 - Niki: but with tap and foil every where ?
24.07.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Haha
24.07.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

24.07.23, 17:11 - Niki: Love you too❤️
24.07.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did I tell you my parents have their own Alex too now?
24.07.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It keeps getting more and more difficult to realise who people are talking about
24.07.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😂
24.07.23, 18:03 - Niki: I think they have a secret club or cult. (all Alex)
24.07.23, 19:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I'm guessing you are not gonna get your grades today? Or does your professor just work at really weird hours?
24.07.23, 19:16 - Niki: Yeah about that my teacher just wrote in the group chqt the grades will be visible from wensday around 14~15 because some people ask about it
24.07.23, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh my god... Couldn't he have just said that sooner??
24.07.23, 19:17 - Niki: Nope but that give me some peace of mind will see
24.07.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad it gave you some peace of mind, I'm just annoyed at your professor because you were stressed about it since last Wednesday
24.07.23, 19:23 - Niki: Yeah get that but its fine i stress myself mostly
24.07.23, 19:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I get that, but I'll be annoyed on your behalf then :)

25.07.23, 01:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think it's crazy and absolutely unbelievable how I keep missing you more every single day
25.07.23, 01:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But when I think about it it makes sense. In such a short time you've become so important to me, I don't want to imagine my life without you anymore. You're one of my best friends and I'm so lucky to be your partner, I don't ever want to take you for granted. You have my full permission to fuck me up if I ever seem to take you for granted anyway. I can't wait to keep growing and see where we go in the future. Idk, just felt like getting this off my chest, I hope reading this starts your day off nicely 😘😊
25.07.23, 08:04 - Niki: It does and i love this text. But also slightly worried that you sta awake for 3 hours hope you still git some sleep. I love you a lot and i hope you know that i feel the same way. Love you hon ❤️

25.07.23, 13:33 - Niki: Yeah kinda should be already just fearing abir if a black out only happen ince but still

25.07.23, 14:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck my love, you'll do great ❤
25.07.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Diese Nachricht wurde gelöscht.
25.07.23, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Went to the vet with Mousti, he's totally fine, just had something to make sure he doesn't have fleas :)
25.07.23, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope your exam went well 😘
25.07.23, 17:02 - Niki: Yeah we arr done now and talking about sgould be fine
25.07.23, 17:02 - Niki: What message did you delete?
25.07.23, 17:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm glad it went well 😘
25.07.23, 17:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just something stupid about the book I was reading, nothing important
25.07.23, 17:06 - Niki: Tell me i am curious
25.07.23, 17:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically just that I should stop reading romance books in general because while I now finally understand them, they also make me feel lonely after I'm done with them. I used to really dislike romantic tropes and things like that because I never understood them or thought people acted too much on unreasonable feelings, but now it makes a lot more sense to me so I kinda like reading them more now.
25.07.23, 17:51 - Niki: Get that and lovely that you think and feel that way but i am kinda sorry too 🥲
25.07.23, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't be sorry, I get to experience more now, it's not a bad thing persé
25.07.23, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does it make me miss you more yeah? Yeah, but that would be the case anyway so not that big of a difference
25.07.23, 17:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Only thing is that depending on the book, I'm missing certain activities more 😅
25.07.23, 17:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I miss you in general so much that that is really more of an oversight
25.07.23, 17:59 - Niki: Miss you too so much and ita getting harder and harder not to just drive to Belgium at any minute 😶
25.07.23, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No matter how much I would love to just suddenly see you at my front door, you have some responsibilities you have to take care of first and I think a couple of people would not be very happy if you suddenly disappeared right now 😅
25.07.23, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's your life though, who am I to tell you what to do?
25.07.23, 18:03 - Niki: No your are a voice of reason that i sometimes dont have
25.07.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In that case, take care of the necessary things, make sure your friends and family don't hate me for taking you away and then you can come over and kiss me 😘
25.07.23, 18:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That being said I have decided on at least 2 things we're gonna do when you're here and yes, both of them are food related whoops 😁
25.07.23, 18:07 - Niki: Kinda Curious now? We gone cook together?
25.07.23, 18:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, now there's 3 ideas I guess
25.07.23, 18:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's a really good ice cream place new nearby and I need to take you there because it's fantastic
25.07.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And apparently there is a new pancake restaurant in Ghent which looks crazy and great so I want to try it out with you 😊
25.07.23, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I just thought of a third idea but I think I'll keep that one a surprise
25.07.23, 18:09 - Niki: Okay sounds nice
25.07.23, 18:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There was a fourth idea but unfortunately I think it's hard to manage right now, will have to wait until we live together I'm afraid (also keeping it a secret)
25.07.23, 18:11 - Niki: You make so curious and i just wanna come over so badly
25.07.23, 18:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You are very cute and I am very tempted to tell you to just come over but unless you sort out everything you need to do still, I'm gonna have to tell you no, no matter how much I hate it
25.07.23, 18:15 - Niki: I love you and i hope that your opinion doesn't change because if you tell me to come over i will be there. I hate it that my voice of reason also keeps me here. But i will wait and do my thinks here first 😮‍💨
25.07.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you too, and I wish I could be selfish and ask you to be here but I'd feel too bad about it 😅 so just hurry up with your things, see it as motivation 😘 (don't overdo it though, have some fun your exams are finally over 🥳)
25.07.23, 18:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna take a shower now (alone) I'll see you during DnD 🥰
25.07.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You are very cute
25.07.23, 20:38 - Niki: thanks i love playing a 16 year old
25.07.23, 20:38 - Niki: love to hear your voice too
25.07.23, 20:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is incredibly funny to watch
25.07.23, 20:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is this how I should imagine 16 year old Niki?
25.07.23, 20:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie, I also like to hear your voice
25.07.23, 20:40 - Niki: no not really more edge and relaxed
25.07.23, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very interesting, too bad I can't meet him
25.07.23, 20:41 - Niki: mhh yeah
25.07.23, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're still enjoying yourself? Not too boring?
25.07.23, 21:42 - Niki: No its great just a bit tired
25.07.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair, 3 hours of rollplay would do that to ya
25.07.23, 21:45 - Niki: Yeah but its still nice
25.07.23, 21:45 - Niki: The story is great
25.07.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you think this part of the story is great, just wait for it 😁
25.07.23, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Remember when I said I would trade you a picture?
25.07.23, 22:02 - Niki: yeah i think for my moms piture
25.07.23, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
25.07.23, 22:02 - Niki: ohhh girl you look good 😘
25.07.23, 22:03 - Niki: I really wanna come over now ahh thanks thought 🥰
25.07.23, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Stay home, eat dinner, I will miss you from the comforts of my bed 🥲❤️
25.07.23, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am also like... Really close to just taking a train and coming over but I don't want to disrupt you when you have a lot of things to do and I have things to do too (though not that important)
25.07.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also deleted the picture I sent you right after I sent it (on my own phone) because I got embarrassed 😅
25.07.23, 22:50 - Niki: Get that if you want me to delete it just tell me.
25.07.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I just didn't want to see it myself 😅
25.07.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I didn't want you to have it I wouldn't have sent it in the first place
25.07.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So no worries
25.07.23, 23:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️

26.07.23, 14:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

If you want to talk about it, you don't want me to say anything about it, or anything else, just let me know. 
Also don't feel pressured to answer, if you want to take some time to yourself I totally get that
26.07.23, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna go to bed now. I hope you ate and drank enough water today, and that you'll be able to sleep well tonight.

26.07.23, 23:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite frankly I don't know how to respond to that because literally all I did/do is care about you and idk, I feel like that's the bare minimum I should be doing 😅
I'm literally so close to buying train tickets and coming over on Friday, you don't even know
26.07.23, 23:07 - Niki: Oh hon i just love you in every possible way ❤️

27.07.23, 08:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I won't come over then. I thought it might be the case, but Alex sent me a message yesterday evening that made me reconsider. He thought me being there would cheer you up. I get wanting to take some time to figure things out, but you're right we can talk about it tonight or whenever you want to. The spelling mistakes are cute 😘
27.07.23, 08:51 - Niki: We can aldo call now if you would rather call me

27.07.23, 18:26 - Niki: why do you have a kilo of liquorice candy ?
27.07.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because I ate 3 of them today (they're kinda nice) and my dad was like "no one eats them, take them with you"
27.07.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So here I am with a kilo of them

28.07.23, 07:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The train is 8 minutes late
28.07.23, 07:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna cry

28.07.23, 07:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very fucking debatable
28.07.23, 07:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will see I guess
28.07.23, 07:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least 10 minutes late... I swear to fucking god
28.07.23, 08:08 - Niki: Well the german rail road system is a joke
28.07.23, 08:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The Belgian one isn't much better honestly, but I prefer it because Belgium is smaller and easier to get around in case something like this happens 🥲
28.07.23, 08:10 - Niki: Well hope the train waits. When should you be in Köln?
28.07.23, 08:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: About 10 minutes

28.07.23, 08:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was wrong, and very happy to be so
28.07.23, 08:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't understand how DB can tell me 3 hours in advance that my train is going to be 2 minutes late... Like how the fuck
28.07.23, 08:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question, what does ggf. Freigeben mean?
28.07.23, 08:57 - Niki: In case of.. Need to make place hard zo translate with out context

28.07.23, 10:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And this one should arrive at 11:37 :)
28.07.23, 10:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, Hannover
28.07.23, 10:54 - Niki: Or makes more sense
28.07.23, 10:54 - Niki: Ok

28.07.23, 12:14 - Niki: Well yeah its the south as allways
28.07.23, 12:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, my grandpa is going to Switzerland (I think) and he was complaining he needs winter tires on his car again

28.07.23, 12:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
28.07.23, 13:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Next stop is Leipzig 🥰
28.07.23, 13:59 - Niki: I am kinda stuck in traffic
28.07.23, 14:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh shit, how far away are you still?
28.07.23, 14:06 - Niki: 10~15 min
28.07.23, 14:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's not too bad
28.07.23, 14:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Keep me updated
28.07.23, 14:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe I can wait outside so we don't have to go in the parking
28.07.23, 14:17 - Niki: 2 min
28.07.23, 14:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why is it so hot here???
28.07.23, 14:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
28.07.23, 14:19 - Niki: Dont know i am waiting outside
28.07.23, 14:20 - Niki: Where we mostly park
28.07.23, 14:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am coming over there
28.07.23, 14:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think
28.07.23, 14:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have to start paying attention when I get here
28.07.23, 14:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I'm right
01.08.23, 08:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out the train doesn't ride to the right station... Fml already done with this shit 🥲
01.08.23, 08:42 - Niki: What why?
01.08.23, 08:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no clue whatsoever
01.08.23, 08:43 - Niki: Fuck the db
01.08.23, 08:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It goes to Frankfurt (M) süd instead and I have to take a transfer to Frankfurt main for some reason
01.08.23, 08:44 - Niki: Sucks but you still get the other trains?
01.08.23, 08:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hopefully
01.08.23, 08:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found a spot, will see if I can stay here
01.08.23, 08:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It says booked for Berlin to Basel but the train came from Berlin and no one is sitting here sooo... Yeah, anyway, the train left so I'll keep you updated
01.08.23, 08:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, turns out there's damage to a bridge in Frankfurt Main apparently
01.08.23, 08:58 - Niki: Okay interesting
01.08.23, 08:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, because that also means it is useless for me to go to Frankfurt main for my connecting train, will have to see what I should do
01.08.23, 09:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know Baldur's Gate?
01.08.23, 09:36 - Niki: Yes the game?
01.08.23, 09:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
01.08.23, 09:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I never knew, but apparently the company that makes it is from Gent??
01.08.23, 09:38 - Niki: Crazy didnt know but nice its a goos game
01.08.23, 09:38 - Niki: Good
01.08.23, 09:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, the third one is apparently really good too, there's a collective 174 hours of video material, absolutely insane
01.08.23, 09:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The pistachio chocolates are really good!
01.08.23, 10:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I should have helped you clean up the kitchen, sorry 😅
01.08.23, 10:25 - Niki: No worrys I got this 😘
01.08.23, 10:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also if you want to reheat the potatoes you can just add the paprika's and maybe a little bit of milk when you hear it up to make sure it doesn't dry out
01.08.23, 10:26 - Niki: Thanks will do 🥰
01.08.23, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Frankfurt sud is a fucking Trainwreck
01.08.23, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely worse than Frankfurt main

01.08.23, 11:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for the compassion
01.08.23, 11:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The weather is a lot better than in Chemnitz though

01.08.23, 12:20 - Niki: Yeah you are sometimes
01.08.23, 12:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's really calm on the train right now, kinda crazy

01.08.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
01.08.23, 17:12 - Niki: We watch the 5 so 6. Yeah but i am not really watching to be honest 😅
01.08.23, 17:13 - Niki: Great to hear that sounds nice
01.08.23, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just put it on for the sake of feeling like you're doing something?
01.08.23, 17:15 - Niki: Yeah 😅

01.08.23, 17:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Reading my book, Alex is supposed to be here soon. The book btw, is fucking insane. I feel like I might go crazy just by reading it 😅
01.08.23, 17:51 - Niki: What happens in the book right now
01.08.23, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The main character is basically being taught how to lose her bodily consciousness but god fucking knows why because I surely don't
01.08.23, 17:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's basically going insane but that is exactly what they want
01.08.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She just now kind of turned into a robot by continually listening to a CD of silence
01.08.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's bonkers
01.08.23, 17:55 - Niki: Does it have a use to be only be subconscious?
01.08.23, 17:55 - Niki: Yeah sound pretty fuck up
01.08.23, 17:56 - Niki: But its still captivating?
01.08.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not about the subconscious I think, more about not being stuck to your body I guess? I think they want a sort of superconscious
01.08.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Incredibly so because it is so insane I need to know how this ends and why the fuck this all happens
01.08.23, 18:00 - Niki: Okay dont get too much sucked in
01.08.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why not?
01.08.23, 18:05 - Niki: Its gone be done really fast then

02.08.23, 18:15 - Niki: Yeah no worries if its nice i will get multiple
02.08.23, 18:15 - Niki: You can have one probably 😅
02.08.23, 18:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically I woke up early and started reading my book, when I looked up it suddenly was 10:07 and I still had to get out of bed and shower and we were meeting up at 10:40 😅
02.08.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got there on time (by some miracle) and we took a train over there, there was a shit ton of rain but we got to the food market which was amazing. There's 17 restaurants with all different cuisines but we only ordered from 4 because both of us can't eat much 😅
02.08.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We went for sushi, Latin American, Indian and Dim Sums
02.08.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ordered too much sushi but everything was really fucking good honestly, it was incredible. Definitely am going back there
02.08.23, 18:18 - Niki: Told you the book gets you suck in 😅
02.08.23, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: After that (we were there for over 2 hours because it was so much food we needed a break in between 😂) we went around for a walk, was nice but Brussels this time of year is way too fucking busy with tourists, had a drink, went for another walk and then home :)
02.08.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It really does, and now I'm hoping someone finds out it's a cult or something and everything she was "taught" was indoctrination but I kinda doubt it
02.08.23, 18:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Almost finished though, probably will be finished tonight
02.08.23, 18:20 - Niki: Whats dim sums?
02.08.23, 18:20 - Niki: Nicw to hear mabye we can go together 🥰
02.08.23, 18:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I made a grave miscalculation so on the 6th and 8th of October I have a first aid course to go to which I hate because I was planning on being in Germany for your birthday 😭

02.08.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will, I'm very unhappy with my own planning skills at the moment.
02.08.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair warning (you do whatever you want) but they all had meat or fish inside
02.08.23, 18:26 - Niki: Okay
02.08.23, 18:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you want great dumplings though, there's a really good place in Gent too where I think there's more options
02.08.23, 18:29 - Niki: Sure sounds like a date 😘?
02.08.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, definitely a date 🥰
02.08.23, 18:30 - Niki: By the way what do you think of theater pieces?
02.08.23, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite nice, I generally enjoy them, why do you ask?
02.08.23, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also not going to Rammstein tomorrow, my dad wants to take my mom on a date so she's going instead 😂

05.08.23, 21:17 - Niki: Nice to hear 🥰. Still thinking about baking something befor the kitchen is unusable anymore? Going to play cards with everyone now and washing up is sometimes really nice to meet new people 😅
05.08.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Might bake something tomorrow morning if I wake up early enough, but other than that no plans because our kitchen will probably stay like this until halfway through October .

07.08.23, 11:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going to the gynaecologist right now, not tearing down more of our kitchen until the 22nd of August :)

Idk, her sister suddenly started asking me about movies with sharks 😅
The only one I knew that she didn't was the Sharknado series.

Laura has a shitty friend who she thinks is not a shitty friend but I can tell you about that later I guess, it's complicated

What are you up to today?

08.08.23, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a bit of searching most of the time but seeing the pile go down is a bit satisfying

08.08.23, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I 100% read that in an Australian accent

08.08.23, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's in the south part, where we won't be, but still
08.08.23, 23:31 - Niki: wow still crazy
08.08.23, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
08.08.23, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway

08.08.23, 23:32 - Niki: Goodnight hon ❤️
09.08.23, 00:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you and I never want to lose you
09.08.23, 00:19 - Niki: Love you too hon ❤️ and i never wanba even think about losing you 🥹
09.08.23, 00:20 - Niki: You making me tear up a bit you know
09.08.23, 00:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think you realise how scared I am that I'm not good for you. Not as in that you would think I'm not good enough for you, but more like me being in your life somehow isn't good or healthy for you. All I want is for you to be happy and healthy, and preferably I'd want to be there for that
09.08.23, 00:26 - Niki: You are and i love you but dont even for a second think like that anymore. You are the most healthy person that happend to me. Just saying it again and again i love you and you are perfect (for me at least you dont think so sometimes. That you arr not perfect )
09.08.23, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know, I'm just laying awake thinking about it because someone made a comment about long distance relationships interfering with life and changing how you do things and that it might not be very healthy or improving life quality and I don't know how to deal with it very well.
09.08.23, 00:28 - Niki: Who made the comment and yeah mabye in some relationship but i dont think its in ours the case
09.08.23, 00:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you so much I'd break my own heart if it would be better for you, and I am not sure that's a good thing
09.08.23, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just someone I know who was also in a long distance relationship (I honestly know way too many people like that Jesus Christ) but it didn't turn out well unfortunately
09.08.23, 00:30 - Niki: I will never let that happen. Will also try to get you to understand that even more
09.08.23, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I sure hope it's not. I know on my side it's not, I'm pretty sure you being in my life has improved so many things, it's crazy
09.08.23, 00:31 - Niki: How old were they and i think we are different
09.08.23, 00:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're sweet and kind and loving and caring and shit, so many good things
09.08.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Around 24, I hope we are
09.08.23, 00:32 - Niki: Its not on my side either. I love yoh and i woupd never change the past if i could. Well mabye get together sooner vut thats the most i would change
09.08.23, 00:32 - Niki: We are
09.08.23, 00:33 - Niki: You are too hon ❤️ and i love you for it too
09.08.23, 00:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I wouldn't change a thing, I honestly quite like how we got together, even if it could have happened sooner 😘
09.08.23, 00:34 - Niki: Yeah it was really nice and a grwat story still 🥰

09.08.23, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I like it, it's nice. I told her I wanted to be able to put it up because last time it was a bit too short for that. My mom likes and my dad as always never really says anything about it unless he dislikes it so I'm assuming he thinks it's at least alright
09.08.23, 17:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

10.08.23, 13:04 - Niki: Yeah i need the 8 hoirs and i will sleep that long if i dont have anything to do
10.08.23, 13:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would, but quite frankly I don't have any time until Monday and I'd rather call you anyway, but I get it if you don't want to
10.08.23, 13:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Smart boi
10.08.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I got a maybe good 6 last night
10.08.23, 13:07 - Niki: Why what happened or is it just fuck up in general
10.08.23, 13:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Only got home late, had to get up early and also slept like shit 🥲 so woke up a couple of times
10.08.23, 13:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ?

10.08.23, 13:49 - Niki: I want to but yeah we can call anytime
10.08.23, 13:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could you please be a little bit more clear about what you mean by that? I'm sorry, I do not have the energy to think about things too much right now 😅
10.08.23, 13:56 - Niki: Yeah no worries. I wanna call you today or any other day but rather sooner than later. Also we can call anytime today so if you wanna be there the howl time for dinner we can call earlier if you wanna too.
10.08.23, 14:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks 
I think I'll call you around 16:30 then if that works for you? Apparently my grandparents are coming over and I would have no chance to disappear from dinner because of that probably 😅
10.08.23, 14:00 - Niki: Okay hon ❤️
10.08.23, 14:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're also right: the sooner the better ❤️
10.08.23, 16:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ready?

10.08.23, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I take back what I said before, I am very much not a fan of muscles, they are gross. The soup is nice though
10.08.23, 20:42 - Niki: Well mabye when you get older 😅. How is it? Still don't feel like talking much?
10.08.23, 20:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's okay, kind of looking at the clock every couple of minutes though, I just wanna get in my bed 😅
Family time is still nice though. How was/is shopping with Alex?
10.08.23, 20:44 - Niki: Was okay also did the dishes and cook more or less together
10.08.23, 20:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a productive evening 😊

10.08.23, 20:44 - Niki: The mango curry
10.08.23, 20:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah! You told me that, I forgot sorry 😅
10.08.23, 20:45 - Niki: Still need to do some more stuff later
10.08.23, 20:46 - Niki: Dont need to apologize would have also forgotten or it could have change
10.08.23, 20:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, that is true 😅😊
10.08.23, 20:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I remember what we forgot to do during our call btw
10.08.23, 20:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We were gonna look at a boat tour/wine tour in Porto
10.08.23, 20:47 - Niki: Ah right fuck
10.08.23, 20:48 - Niki: Well next time or when i come over will see

10.08.23, 20:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just said it because u remembered and I don't want to forget it again 😅
10.08.23, 20:52 - Niki: Will bring it up hopefully 😅
10.08.23, 20:53 - Niki: How is everybody doing in your family
10.08.23, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite alright, though my grandpa was supposed to have a tennis match tonight but the other guy didn't show up
10.08.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and Pieter just said my life is pathetic because I don't know how long his bag of tea is supposed to be in the water 😂
10.08.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, did your parents get back home alright?
10.08.23, 21:00 - Niki: Yeah they got back early like Thursday i think
10.08.23, 21:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, nice
10.08.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad they got home safe, with all the shit that is happening in Europe now
10.08.23, 21:01 - Niki: Damm he take tea searious 😅. Well English went to war because of tea
10.08.23, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He's as far from English as can be 😂
If there was 1 über Belgian, it would be him
10.08.23, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm kind of debating on trying to get him into MTG, I think he would be susceptible other than the fact that it costs a lot of money
10.08.23, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And the word "sauce" is being used so much I am awaiting the usual jokes 🥲
10.08.23, 21:11 - Niki: "he would be susceptible" is a interesting way of saying he might like it 😅
10.08.23, 21:12 - Niki: Need to think about that one for a sec. Yeah you will never get rid of that one 🥲
10.08.23, 21:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think he would mainly like how organised and clean it can be
10.08.23, 21:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhhh, so far so good though :)
10.08.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Everyone is gone, I love them but goddamn, I was done the last half hour 😅, kind of surprised they're already gone though, would have expected them to stay longer
10.08.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna go to sleep
10.08.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight schat ❤️

13.08.23, 20:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think it should be pretty nice, only thing that sucks is that we didn't eat and there's also nothing to eat here 😅🥲

13.08.23, 22:50 - Niki: yeah
13.08.23, 22:51 - Niki: How was the concert by the way
13.08.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was really damn good
13.08.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They played a movie/documentary about Belgian nature and the orchestra basically did the background music but it was phenomenal
13.08.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At times I forgot it was live music because it fit so well, and the director of the orchestra also composed the music himself, was pretty cool :)
13.08.23, 22:52 - Niki: Sounds really nice. There is that much natue in belgium 😅😋
13.08.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: More than I realised and in weirder spots than I thought 😅
13.08.23, 22:53 - Niki: nice mabye we can visit some
13.08.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like for example salamanders, apparently they very often breed under train tracks for some reason?
13.08.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, because it's hot and not a lot of other animals that would prey on them go there
13.08.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But that's not the point
13.08.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe :)
13.08.23, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We also have the largest and one of the last populations of a very specific type of spider (don't know if my translation is correct but the spring fire spider)
13.08.23, 23:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We found a Burgerking that is still open Hallelujah fast food chains 🥳
13.08.23, 23:03 - Niki: nice

14.08.23, 08:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I slept alright. This morning I haven't got anything planned (was planning on sleeping in but clearly that's not happening) then I have to work a couple of hours in the afternoon and then we are going to the sea for the evening 😊
What do you have planned?
14.08.23, 08:39 - Niki: Nothing planned on my side for today mqbye driving home to my parents
14.08.23, 08:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really want to hear your voice right now. Do you mind calling or something? Idk 😅
If it's too early I get that
14.08.23, 08:42 - Niki: We can but i wont be as response like normally
14.08.23, 08:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I can work with that
14.08.23, 08:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: May I?
14.08.23, 08:43 - Niki: Yes you may
14.08.23, 08:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
14.08.23, 11:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record, when I tell you not to rush it's not because I don't want to see you as soon as possible, I just want you to be safe and stress free
14.08.23, 11:11 - Niki: Yeah i know hon dont worry i get you 😘
14.08.23, 11:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's your favourite flavour of ice cream again?
14.08.23, 11:55 - Niki: Dont really have one a lot that i like if i need to say one it woukd vw Cookie dough
14.08.23, 12:00 - Niki: Yours was pistachio?
14.08.23, 12:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I thought that but wasn't sure about it. Yeah, mine is pistachio but only if it's high quality ice cream, otherwise it doesn't taste that well
14.08.23, 12:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But practically everything else is fine as long as it's not strawberry ice cream
14.08.23, 12:14 - Niki: Why the distaste for strawberry?
14.08.23, 12:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've just never had good strawberry ice cream
14.08.23, 12:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorbet is something else though
14.08.23, 12:40 - Niki: Okay yeah get that
14.08.23, 12:41 - Niki: Miss you hon ❤️
14.08.23, 13:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Miss you too 🥰
14.08.23, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you're having a great day 😘
We're at a restaurant now and I'm severely underdressed 😂
14.08.23, 19:31 - Niki: Happens to the best of us 😅
14.08.23, 19:32 - Niki: Going to play magic now
14.08.23, 19:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun!!
14.08.23, 20:02 - Niki: Thanks hope you have a great night too
14.08.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just got home, how was/is your evening?
14.08.23, 23:54 - Niki: Is nice still playing. But i think i am going to drive home soon
14.08.23, 23:54 - Niki: How was your night hon?
15.08.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How are you doing in the game?
15.08.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My night was nice, spent some time on the beach and then we went to the restaurant and the food was amazing 🤩
Definitely dressed up wrong though, I was wearing a band t shirt and everyone else there was dressed up to the nines, some people even were looking at me weirdly 😅
15.08.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you have a safe drive home 😘
15.08.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna go to sleep now
15.08.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️
15.08.23, 00:18 - Niki: Goodnight hon ❤️
15.08.23, 00:20 - Niki: Going great
15.08.23, 00:22 - Niki: Sounds like fun. Was the underdress really bad or did you felt it so bad?
15.08.23, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably a bit of both, people were looking at me weirdly, but I also wasn't aware it was gonna be a fancy restaurant so yeah 😅 couldn't do anything about it
15.08.23, 00:38 - Niki: Sucks a bit but oh well
15.08.23, 09:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon, did you have a good night?
15.08.23, 10:37 - Niki: Good morning my love. I had a great night. Hope you had a good night too 😘
15.08.23, 10:38 - Niki: Any plans for today except dnd later tonight?
15.08.23, 10:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, we're going to the reception of a cycling race event. It's really difficult to explain it but basically it's organised by the father of my aunt's ex boyfriend but we get free tickets because my parents sponsor it so we take full advantage of it to have free food and drinks :)
15.08.23, 10:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are your plans for today other than DnD?
15.08.23, 10:41 - Niki: Nothing much just cleaning and organizing stuff here
15.08.23, 10:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun with that, put some nice music on 😘
Oh yeah, btw, what was the thing you had to tell me about the bahncard 50? I just remembered about it 😅
15.08.23, 10:44 - Niki: Oh yeah right. I am not sure but i think it only work in regional trains not in ice trains
15.08.23, 10:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, I checked that and it should work on ICE trains too, but I'll check again to be sure
15.08.23, 10:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
15.08.23, 10:47 - Niki: Okay nevermind then 😅
15.08.23, 10:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why did you think it only works on regional trains maybe?
15.08.23, 10:48 - Niki: My sister told me something and that she was a bit worried it wouldn't work
15.08.23, 10:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, okay, that's nice 😊
I'm happy it does work though 😊
15.08.23, 12:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I always forget what kind of aristocratic bullshit this event is holy shit
15.08.23, 13:02 - Niki: Yeah well cycling isnt really a sport for the poor people. I mean the goos bikes cost a fortune its crazy
15.08.23, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, but the reception is triple so bad, everyone here is part of the "better class" people like the mayor of the city, rich people, CEO's all that shit
15.08.23, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We know the organisers which is mainly why we're here
15.08.23, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You also have an invitation for next year btw 😅
15.08.23, 13:12 - Niki: Nice 😅
15.08.23, 13:13 - Niki: You just take the food with you or you actually talk to sum people
15.08.23, 13:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The food is pretty good and other than that all I do is sit with my family so yeah
15.08.23, 13:13 - Niki: Damm your fast
15.08.23, 13:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, we're on the same wavelength, I was typing that before you sent your message already 😂
15.08.23, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't wait to see you again
15.08.23, 15:33 - Niki: Cant wait to see you too ❤️
15.08.23, 19:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: cutie
15.08.23, 19:39 - Niki: cutie too
15.08.23, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're gonna meet up with Aeneas on Sunday morning at the cat cafe in Kortrijk for breakfast and after that he's spending the day with us + sleeping over until Monday when he needs to get a train at 7:30, so I'll have to get up early to bring him to the train station
15.08.23, 21:58 - Niki: okay sounds great i am excited 🤭
15.08.23, 22:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same 😊
15.08.23, 22:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad is too 😂
16.08.23, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
16.08.23, 08:31 - Niki: Sorry fell asleep really fast 😅
16.08.23, 08:33 - Niki: Hope you still had a good night of sleep hon 😘. You gonna go shopping with jinte today right? If you meet up with her say hi from me.
16.08.23, 10:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I get that. I woke up at 4:30 and 6:30 and then now so yeah 😅 
I'll give Jinte your regards 😊
16.08.23, 16:07 - Niki: Hope your day is going great. Hoe is shopping with jinte? I know you both hate it but is it still enjoy able?
16.08.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know how you correctly incorporated a Dutch word in that sentence but it's impressive, well done 😂😘
Shopping is fine, we both found what we need so now we're just hanging out :)
How's your day going?
16.08.23, 17:45 - Niki: Hoe? It should be how but i miss typ it sometimes
16.08.23, 17:47 - Niki: If i may ask what did you and jinte get?
16.08.23, 17:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly, that's the Dutch translation so it makes perfect sense but I was kind of surprised by it 😂
16.08.23, 17:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just some stuff Jinte needed for Morocco, a reflective heat blanket and then for both of us some sunscreen
16.08.23, 17:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
16.08.23, 18:19 - Niki: Hon i got some bad news because of business relates stuff i can come only Friday evening.
16.08.23, 18:19 - Niki: We need to set up a website so i need to help them and we need to meet up in person for that 🥲
16.08.23, 18:20 - Niki: Also we found that out today and i am working on it the howl time right now 🥲
16.08.23, 18:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, no problem, I told you not to rush so I counted on Friday anyway, if you came on Thursday it would have been a nice surprise though 😘
Make sure the website looks nice so I can look at it and be proud you made it 😉

17.08.23, 08:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon 😘 hope you had a good night! Good luck at the meeting and with the website today! 🤞🏻🍀❤️
17.08.23, 09:06 - Niki: No worrys hon happens

17.08.23, 09:11 - Niki: Yeah kinda it changed yesterday evening but the date wasn't fixed then so 😅. Will do
17.08.23, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dude, yesterday evening sounds chaotic as fuck if the date for that meeting wasn't even fixed then??
17.08.23, 09:42 - Niki: Yeah it is and it suck but cant really change much on the situation
17.08.23, 12:20 - Niki: Going to my parents house now. How is your day going so far? Any plans for today?

17.08.23, 12:59 - Niki: Nice to hear that hope you can fix it 😘
17.08.23, 14:55 - Niki: By the way my mom wants your number so no problem right?
17.08.23, 15:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah of course no problem! I mean, I have her number already so it's only fair 😅
17.08.23, 15:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kind of fixed it but not really? Gave up after 3 hours of trial and error
17.08.23, 15:07 - Niki: Got love it sometimes
17.08.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh it's fucking great, it's a bullshit problem too, pretty sure the software just sucks honestly 😅
17.08.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, are we doing datenight tonight?
17.08.23, 15:11 - Niki: To be honest i still have a shit ton to do so could we move it to Saturday and just relax together and watch a movie or go eat some where. Or was there something planned on Saturday
17.08.23, 15:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, makes sense. I'm not sure about Saturday but I have an idea for a date in the morning if you're up for it (assuming you'll be here at a reasonable time tomorrow).
We have some shit to do in the afternoon but I don't know about the evening.
17.08.23, 15:13 - Niki: Okay yeah will try to be there in the morning sounds great 🥰
17.08.23, 15:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll try to be there in the morning... Honey no

17.08.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your night going hon?
17.08.23, 22:50 - Niki: Failing at my doulingo and looking at more coding stuff 😶
17.08.23, 22:50 - Niki: How is your night going hon? 🥰
17.08.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: While Alex and (I'm assuming Patrick) are at the Indiana Jones movie? That's pretty shitty
17.08.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's going alright I guess
17.08.23, 22:54 - Niki: Yeah its fine because they need to go to a business think tomorrow and i dont wanna be there so
17.08.23, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, shouldn't you be there too though?  I mean, not that I want to keep you away but the business thing sounds pretty important if it's the thing that was rescheduled from today to tomorrow
17.08.23, 23:05 - Niki: Its not that important and i dislike this one. No worries hon
17.08.23, 23:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... I have sincere doubts
17.08.23, 23:12 - Niki: Hon its still all fun no worries please. We talk about it and fine.
17.08.23, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay okay
17.08.23, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm sorry, my brain is just fucking up today and I'm worrying about too much
17.08.23, 23:14 - Niki: Love you brain and no worries i got you 😘
17.08.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no clue what the fuck you even mean by that, unless you're kidnapping me to take me to a therapist or a lobotomy
17.08.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry, that was maybe too dark of a joke
17.08.23, 23:16 - Niki: no i wont but still a nice joke 😅
17.08.23, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, what's still on your to-do list before you can start driving?
17.08.23, 23:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you thought that was a hint to get back to work, I was genuinely asking/curious 😅
17.08.23, 23:26 - Niki: Work on the website talk with the designer about it and some more packing.
17.08.23, 23:29 - Niki: Didn't think that but yeah it could have though so.
17.08.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Been trying to find a response to this for the last 10 minutes but I'm coming up blank
17.08.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck
17.08.23, 23:39 - Niki: Sorry i am trying to typ better
17.08.23, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I wasn't trying to blame you with that
17.08.23, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like I said
17.08.23, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mind = broken tonight
17.08.23, 23:41 - Niki: Okay hope it still okayish to relax a bit
17.08.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm
17.08.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doubt it
17.08.23, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Decided to break myself mentally tonight, may or may not rebuild by tomorrow. Guess you'll find out once you get here
17.08.23, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
17.08.23, 23:48 - Niki: Goodnight hon ❤️
17.08.23, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh honey, I think you misunderstood that one massively. I'll let you enjoy it
18.08.23, 00:13 - Niki: Yeah i am also starting to think that i dont get it fully
18.08.23, 10:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning love, hope you have a productive day 😘
18.08.23, 11:03 - Niki: Good morning my love hope you have a great day too. Will see how much i do today

19.08.23, 00:51 - Niki: Sorry read it to late

19.08.23, 00:53 - Niki: You can decide
19.08.23, 00:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna stay home then, I really don't like walking through the park so late at night 😅 (I don't want you to walk through it either but yeah)
19.08.23, 00:54 - Niki: I would love to see you as soon as possible
19.08.23, 00:54 - Niki: Okay

19.08.23, 00:56 - Niki: Yes
19.08.23, 00:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh
19.08.23, 00:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay that makes sense, that's a youth movement group

15.09.23, 09:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am happy you're safely home, hope you get some sleep now 😘
15.09.23, 15:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm assuming by the reels that you are alive, somewhat awake and dealing with sleep deprivation. How you doing hon?
15.09.23, 15:36 - Niki: Damm you know me
15.09.23, 15:36 - Niki: Yeah doing okayish need to sleep but can't and alex and Patrick wanna do something tonight.
15.09.23, 15:37 - Niki: Your out with kato eight now right?
15.09.23, 15:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would hope so at this point 😘
15.09.23, 15:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope it's not too exhausting so you can enjoy it too, and that you can get some sleep tonight. What happened on the drive btw?
15.09.23, 15:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got back home, Cato's meeting was over faster than expected so we met up earlier. Because of that I also forgot to take the camera with me though... kinda sad about that but I'll go to develop it sometime this weekend then
15.09.23, 15:42 - Niki: Feel something wad of on the last 100 km and so i drove slower and just wanted to go home. Well 30 km later the tire exploded but all was good and i could control it and drive to the side. After that just getting towed for the first time was a interesting experience
15.09.23, 15:43 - Niki: Nice how is she doing? How was the oats? Any plans for the rest of the day?
15.09.23, 15:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn... it exploded? Fuck, that's... well, I'm incredibly happy you could control the car still. 1 question though, do you always go through 1 tire a year? 😘😜 I hope you didn't have to wait too long to get towed and everything gets fixed soon
15.09.23, 15:46 - Niki: Yeah me and tires not getting warm with them
15.09.23, 15:46 - Niki: Took all in all till i could sleep about 4 hours but they went by fast
15.09.23, 15:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's doing well, starting school next week too, we talked a lot and registered for the ticketsale, we'll know next Wednesday if we get to be in the ticketsale or not. Oats was nice, I had some good carrot cake 😊
The only plan I have today is to wash Moustache because apparently he was covered in shit this morning, my dad got most of it out with scissors but he should get a good wash too 😅
15.09.23, 15:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's pretty fast gotta say. You put on a new tire or that still has to happen?
15.09.23, 15:47 - Niki: Poor Moustache 🥲 and yeah better wash him
15.09.23, 15:49 - Niki: Nope no new tire just towed it to my parents garage(the one they allways go too) and it sits there now and the will look at it
15.09.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank god you weren't that far away from home when it happened so it could get towed there. Someone picked you up from there then?
15.09.23, 15:53 - Niki: Yeah my dad. Family is great 🥰
15.09.23, 15:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Family really is great ❤️
15.09.23, 15:55 - Niki: Yeah getting back to trying to sleep a bit more. Mabye you wanna call later today?
15.09.23, 15:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, if you want to and have time sure, but please get some rest before you have to meet up with your friends later today, the last thing I want is for you to exhaust yourself even more than you already are or to get stressed over a phonecall we planned. So, if you want to call later, send me a message and I'll keep an eye on my phone okay?
15.09.23, 15:57 - Niki: Okay will do love you rabbit ❤️

16.09.23, 01:05 - Niki: Love you too my love, goodnight ❤️

16.09.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sadly without you indeed 😢
My cousin was supposed to come over to pick up a book but apparently she's not doing that anymore so I have nothing planned today 😅 probably will watch some series on Netflix and prepare a bit for school. What are you up to today? And how was your evening yesterday?
16.09.23, 10:16 - Niki: Sounds nice and relaxing. For me its similar prepare for school too and do something with my family. Just that at 16:00 I am meeting up with Marco and Ole.
16.09.23, 10:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would say it is nice and relaxing but I'd honestly rather do something else and meet up with some people, it's easier to 'move on' that way I guess
16.09.23, 10:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun with Marco and Ole! You're gonna play games or hang out and do some other things?
16.09.23, 10:21 - Niki: Yeah get that doing the same but i still is difficulty still thinking about you. Like doing just anything and thinking it would be nicer with you or you would like it. Or just being alone and wishing you were here 🥲.
Love you hon ❤️
16.09.23, 10:22 - Niki: Hang out
16.09.23, 10:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I get that 100%. When I was with my cousin yesterday I felt a bit down before we met up and I was talking about our trip and I was suddenly so much happier just thinking of you and talking about you 😅
Love you too my love ❤️
16.09.23, 10:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice!
16.09.23, 11:42 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
16.09.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For Paris?
16.09.23, 11:45 - Niki: No all the way at the top 698.29
16.09.23, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh
16.09.23, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I see
16.09.23, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn that's a lot of money
16.09.23, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can you add it to the tricount?
16.09.23, 11:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh you did already
16.09.23, 11:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice
16.09.23, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have a couple of things I paid for too that aren't added to the tricount yet
16.09.23, 11:51 - Niki: Yeah we eat out too much Maybe 😅. Kinda hope that we get even
16.09.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh... I think so too 😅
16.09.23, 11:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 17€ difference still
16.09.23, 11:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't have any regrets on the money spent though, I fucking loved every second of that trip
16.09.23, 11:54 - Niki: yeah same 🥰
16.09.23, 11:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh wait, we might get even actually
16.09.23, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: €4, so be it 😂
16.09.23, 11:57 - Niki: Money is a weird think. Alex ,me and his dad talk about it Yesterday. It is so weird to talk about and it can get really stress full. Not that is with you i would buy you everything i can but its a weird topic
16.09.23, 11:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It really is a weird topic
16.09.23, 12:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't really like it too much either, it's always somewhat stressful, especially when it's with someone else because I know how much money I can spend, but I have no fucking clue what is in someone else's bank account. I feel the same way with you, but it still makes me feel kind of weird just having this kind of business transaction? If that makes sense?
16.09.23, 12:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also hope that if one of us can't pay for something or would rather save money that we can talk about that casually, money really sucks in that aspect.
16.09.23, 12:04 - Niki: Yeah get that but mabye talk more about it but i dont know its weird.
16.09.23, 12:04 - Niki: Yeah totally
16.09.23, 12:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, talking about it more could make it easier to talk about but I don't really like talking about it too much either because it's such a stupid thing. People should talk more about salaries and all that, but talking about the money in your bank account feels weirdly personal
16.09.23, 12:08 - Niki: Yeah feel the same. Its like you need to survive and its nice to have. But its also so irrelevant and such a "bad" topic/thing. Likr its boring and its just a think/construct
16.09.23, 12:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, exactly
16.09.23, 12:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess who's gonna go watch Barbie for the third time?
16.09.23, 13:02 - Niki: Yeah nice its a pretty good movie 😊. With your mom?
16.09.23, 13:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, Jinte and her family
16.09.23, 13:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should be interesting
16.09.23, 13:03 - Niki: Yeah i would think so too please let me kbow how they like it

16.09.23, 13:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does it switch every 2 weeks or is it just really unregular?
16.09.23, 13:39 - Niki: every week it switches like week a then week b and so on
16.09.23, 13:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh okay, I see
16.09.23, 13:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We should really get a shared calendar 😅
16.09.23, 13:48 - Niki: yeah would help alot i think

16.09.23, 14:33 - Niki: Settings on the lower right site and then all the way down
16.09.23, 14:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ???
16.09.23, 14:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm fucking something up for sure
16.09.23, 14:35 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
16.09.23, 14:35 - Niki: Mabye that helps
16.09.23, 14:36 - Niki: It also takes a while until its loading the days in
16.09.23, 14:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I figured it out!!
16.09.23, 14:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It should also all be in there now
16.09.23, 14:39 - Niki: So we use this one?
16.09.23, 14:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess so yeah
16.09.23, 14:39 - Niki: Nice great job hon 😘

16.09.23, 14:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're gonna have to make some adjustments with DnD as well now I think about it
16.09.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same with datenight
16.09.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least, idk, depends on how you feel about that one
16.09.23, 14:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I'm also thinking it will be best if I come over to Germany at the end of October, because you have a shit ton of classes then still and I don't want you to miss them (again, depends on what you think too of course)
16.09.23, 14:58 - Niki: Yeah i thought i had some holiday but no
16.09.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You do, but it's the first 2 days of the week, while I have holiday the last 3 days of the week
16.09.23, 15:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's complicated, but we switch off, annoyingly enough
16.09.23, 15:07 - Niki: Yup it sucks but you can gladly come over. If you wanna too.
16.09.23, 15:08 - Niki: Also my grandfather will host his bday party on the 16.12 and i think i am expect to be there becaus its his 70 bday. So i wont be there for your bday
16.09.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would love to come over hon 😘
16.09.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh well, there will be plenty of birthdays to celebrate in the future too, and this way it's even that I won't be there for yours too ;)
16.09.23, 15:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Plus, it works out better if you want to come over here after chirstmas anyway, that way you won't have to drive back and forth
16.09.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, how long is your study traject going to be now? How many exemptions did you get?
16.09.23, 19:04 - Niki: Still waiting for the answer for this one gone call there this week probably because they ignore my mails
16.09.23, 19:05 - Niki: Yeah you dont need to feel bad for that anymore
16.09.23, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, school administration is slowww, hope they at least pick up the phone
16.09.23, 19:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice try but I still do 😅
16.09.23, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
16.09.23, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really fucking miss you
16.09.23, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't think it would be this bad honestly, but idk, I miss you more than ever
16.09.23, 23:49 - Niki: 🥹 I love and i hate to hear that. I wanna be there so badly right now.
16.09.23, 23:49 - Niki: I miss you too honey ❤️
16.09.23, 23:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day been?
16.09.23, 23:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk if you're still hanging out with Ole and Marco but if you are please hang out with them, I can wait 😘
16.09.23, 23:53 - Niki: Was pretty good did some work and relaxing with family. Then was at Marco's place talk about the future and other stuff with them. They are really happy that i am back. They wanna meet up more and play games with me.
16.09.23, 23:54 - Niki: Nah ole went home at 19 because he was going back to Leipzig and me and marco hamg out until 21:30 or something
16.09.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a great time 😊 you should definitely meet up more with them if you can, you're gonna play Baldur's gate with the 4 of you then?
16.09.23, 23:54 - Niki: How was your day my love?
16.09.23, 23:55 - Niki: Yes sir and they were thinking about some other games too so we will see. But to be honest I don't have that much time right now mabye around Christmas
16.09.23, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was supposed to see my cousin today, but in the end her mom just came to pick up some books for her instead, did a few things to prepare for school and then I was suddenly invited to go to the movies with Jinte & co. Went there and now I'm back home. That was the best part of my day, other than that it's been a bit shit honestly 😅
16.09.23, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice, I hope you find some time 🙏
16.09.23, 23:59 - Niki: Yeah meeting up with people helps me alot with miss you (too).
16.09.23, 23:59 - Niki: *Missing
16.09.23, 23:59 - Niki: I am really bad at spelling sometimes
17.09.23, 00:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Usually I still understand what you're saying, no worries 😘
17.09.23, 00:02 - Niki: Yeah you got really good at understanding my bullshit that i say or feel. Its crazy normally only Alex or Marco and Ole. And they know me for years /some even for a decade
17.09.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I think it's not that difficult most of the time? I don't really think about it too much, usually I just instinctively understand it? I don't know if you get what I mean?
17.09.23, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: God knows sometimes I have absolutely no clue what you're thinking/saying but most of the time I can figure it out pretty easily
17.09.23, 00:05 - Niki: Yeah no i think we just feel the same but think im different ways sometimes. But i get what you mean.
17.09.23, 00:05 - Niki: Hehe my brain goes into really stupid mood then 😅
17.09.23, 00:05 - Niki: Mode
17.09.23, 00:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, sometimes my brain is just a bit slow
17.09.23, 00:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or takes a complete detour to another dimension
17.09.23, 00:07 - Niki: Yeah true that its just off then 🚀
17.09.23, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
17.09.23, 00:11 - Niki: I look funny and i love too see you. Even if its only part of your head.
Miss you hon ❤️
17.09.23, 00:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Miss you too, probably a little too much 😅❤️
17.09.23, 00:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know how people go through break ups if I already feel like shit just simply not being close to you honestly
17.09.23, 00:15 - Niki: Yeah i think some people just block it off for a few days and then thex break. I couldn't imagine breaking up with you though so we will never find out 🥰❤️
17.09.23, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I haven't cried since before you left but god knows I might at any moment I'm by myself, nevermind if I'm out under any amount of stress 😅
I can't imagine breaking up with you either, not even in my worst nightmares 😘❤️
17.09.23, 00:18 - Niki: Hope you that feeling isnt the howl time or stays like that strong.
17.09.23, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I guess I'll find out
17.09.23, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm probably just having withdrawal symptoms
17.09.23, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My constant source of dopamine isn't here anymore so ya know
17.09.23, 00:24 - Niki: Sounds like i am a drug too you and you make a cold break
17.09.23, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Practically you might be
17.09.23, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're way too addictive 😘
17.09.23, 00:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's true that practically living together with you for a month and then suddenly not seeing you anymore is not treating me very well
17.09.23, 00:25 - Niki: Well your then your my drug too so can you be my dealer 😘
17.09.23, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd fucking do it all again though, time after time after time
17.09.23, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can get all the things you want for free 😘
17.09.23, 00:28 - Niki: Love too hear that but still its kinda got me worried abit
17.09.23, 00:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah
17.09.23, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You shouldn't be too worried
17.09.23, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, the only bad thing I've done so far is fuck up my eating schedule today
17.09.23, 00:31 - Niki: Tell me more please?
17.09.23, 00:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Other than that I'm just sad/not as happy as I would usually be, but I should get better soon
17.09.23, 00:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... do you really want to know? I... fucked up
17.09.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will try to do better tomorrow I swear
17.09.23, 00:32 - Niki: Like i said earlier i hope so please 🙏🏼. It doesn't need to go away completely but atleast to a not worrying way
17.09.23, 00:33 - Niki: Please do and send me pictures of your food and tell me what your up too hon 😘🥰
17.09.23, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 🥰😅 will do

17.09.23, 00:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you
17.09.23, 00:34 - Niki: I love you too ❤️
17.09.23, 00:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you for taking care of me
17.09.23, 00:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's just easier for me to take care of myself when I have someone else to consider too, so not having that suddenly makes it more difficult, I just have to get back into the rhythm of taking care of only myself again
17.09.23, 00:35 - Niki: Well i would hurt myself if i wouldn't care about. I would feel bad myself if i didn't carw about your well being.
17.09.23, 00:36 - Niki: Cat sounds great ❤️
17.09.23, 00:36 - Niki: And anytime anywhere and forever hon ❤️

17.09.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's going pretty well, I made a lemon custard and now I'm waiting for that to cool down so I can use it. The only thing that's kinda weird is that Barry seems to be scared of me suddenly? I don't know why 😢
17.09.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the building IKEA furniture going/helping your dad?
17.09.23, 15:49 - Niki: We waiting for my aunt right now at here house

17.09.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
17.09.23, 18:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
17.09.23, 19:30 - Niki: Poor Moustache cant even use thw couch anymore

17.09.23, 19:33 - Niki: Yeah its great. How is the baking going?
17.09.23, 19:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Baking is going alright I think, I put 1 batch in the freezer and 1 in the fridge, I'm very curious to see which one will turn out better
17.09.23, 19:39 - Niki: Nice any plans for the rest of the day?
17.09.23, 19:39 - Niki: Any predictions on which one should be better?
17.09.23, 19:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, except trying out the dessert once it's done 😊
17.09.23, 19:40 - Niki: Would love to see a picture
17.09.23, 19:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I personally think the frozen one should be better because the lemon curd will probably be too liquid when it's not frozen, but maybe the biscuit layer is too thick sooo... really will have to see
17.09.23, 19:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does not look very interesting but I'll definitely send you one 😘
17.09.23, 19:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna go hang out with Alex now?

17.09.23, 19:46 - Niki: *13
17.09.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but it's not just that, they have had a shit ton of chances and only scored 1 goal while the other team came over once and scored 😅
17.09.23, 20:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Forgot to take a picture of dinner, but we had grilled veggies with chimichurrie and beef
17.09.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

20.09.23, 11:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Again, I have nothing in common with them
20.09.23, 11:30 - Niki: well its okay
20.09.23, 11:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess
20.09.23, 11:30 - Niki: then you probably wont be friends with them or you just share your knowledge
20.09.23, 11:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess, maybe I'll just be a loner this year

20.09.23, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice! Lavender smells so good too!
20.09.23, 14:10 - Niki: By the way Alex and Me talk about Doggystyle and the lack of intimacy. That we both miss. To be honest was a interestiinng topic out of the blue
20.09.23, 14:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is a very interesting topic to suddenly discuss yeah 😂
20.09.23, 14:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I get that, that position really isn't about intimacy, it feels nice but I like being able to see you and actually touch you more
20.09.23, 14:33 - Niki: But we both agreed that the lack of intimacy sucks but the hip movement is easier.
20.09.23, 16:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man... I shouldn't be allowed to drive a car like I am feeling now Jesus Christ
20.09.23, 16:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going?

20.09.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I should drive more often, the problem is just that I really don't need it 😅

21.09.23, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, do I need to remind you these are rich people who really don't have any responsibilities?
21.09.23, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no, please don't stay awake because I'm still working, go to sleep my love 😘
21.09.23, 00:12 - Niki: I will grateful say no ☺️
21.09.23, 00:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie 🥰
21.09.23, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just now done with work, walking in the pitch black dark to my car is less fun I have to say 😅
21.09.23, 00:17 - Niki: Dont die please 😅
21.09.23, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll try 😅

21.09.23, 00:54 - Niki: Hope so too we will see each other in our dreams then 😘
21.09.23, 00:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 🥰
21.09.23, 01:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss feeling your heat in my bed, our bodies next to each other, or on top, cuddling. Just simply undressing and getting to hug you, feel how warm (and hot) you are. Turning around to steal a kiss, getting distracted and doing a whole lot more than just a peck, then turning back around because now we "really should go to sleep". Waking up next to you in the morning and admiring your beauty first thing in the morning. I miss you
21.09.23, 10:04 - Niki: Hon i feel the same way and i cant wait until November to do all that again. Hope you can sleep well without me thought. I miss you too ALOT ❤️.
 I also love too read text like this and please Always wirte me something like this if you feel like it 😘
21.09.23, 10:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning to you too 😘
21.09.23, 10:33 - Niki: Yeah good morning hon 😅
21.09.23, 10:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can sleep well without you, no worries, I actually only went to sleep then because when I got home my dad was still up and we talked for a bit 😅
21.09.23, 10:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're a cutie and I love you 🥰
21.09.23, 10:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And no worries, if I feel like this I will very likely always write you about it too 😘
21.09.23, 10:37 - Niki: Thanks Hon ❤️
21.09.23, 10:37 - Niki: Nice your dad was still awake?
21.09.23, 10:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, he was watching One Piece and I know he stayed up just to know I got home safe. He really likes One Piece actually, so now I wanna watch it too
21.09.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can I ask you to do this too?
21.09.23, 10:39 - Niki: nice we can watch it together if you wanna too

21.09.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also think it's gonna be done that fast because I went to a photographer instead of another shop
21.09.23, 13:05 - Niki: Nah your allways smart

21.09.23, 19:20 - Niki: My parents / sister
21.09.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, okay :)

21.09.23, 19:25 - Niki: Ahh well i probably should but i also wanna call me 😬
21.09.23, 19:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can also call later if you don't want to choose? Then you can hang out with her a bit longer and if you decide you would rather hang out with her for the rest of the night you just let me know? I totally understand you know 😘
21.09.23, 19:30 - Niki: Okay will see thanks for taking care of my decision 🥰. I really mean it

22.09.23, 21:37 - Niki: Whar you mean you dont use puppet the howl time
22.09.23, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, there's a lot more to first aid then just reanimation, it's also taking care of wounds and all that
22.09.23, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Today was a purely theoretical class

23.09.23, 17:33 - Niki: Okay love you hon
23.09.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too ❤️
23.09.23, 19:22 - Niki: Back at home now
23.09.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, what do you want to do?
23.09.23, 19:23 - Niki: You wanna come over 😘
23.09.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I fucking wish
23.09.23, 19:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Imagine if it was only a 30 minute drive or something... sounds like heaven
23.09.23, 19:24 - Niki: I would be there every day
23.09.23, 19:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, same 🥲
23.09.23, 19:25 - Niki: Wanna call now?
23.09.23, 19:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In 10 minutes? My laundry is just done so I'll hang it up first okay?
23.09.23, 19:26 - Niki: No worrys just write me when you got time
23.09.23, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When do you eat dinner?
23.09.23, 19:35 - Niki: Still need to
23.09.23, 19:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You wanna call after dinner then?
23.09.23, 19:39 - Niki: Sure
23.09.23, 19:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me know when then?
23.09.23, 19:57 - Niki: I would ve ready
23.09.23, 19:57 - Niki: *🥰
23.09.23, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.09.23, 20:44 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.09.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I kinda do miss calling you at night until we both have to go to sleep. I know you didn't really like that too much though, but just the thought of falling asleep together is nice, even if over the phone. Idk if that makes sense or not.
23.09.23, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also you know what, you're actually right, female friends sometimes do work that way, but to be able to get use of them when you're asking questions for presents... you have to pay attention to make sure they're not disappointed either when they ask you questions to figure out how to help you. No clue if that makes sense but it does 😅
23.09.23, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think part of this is also just that I don't like saying goodbye to you in any case, nevermind when I'm not entirely sure when we will call next and for the last time of today or something.
23.09.23, 22:13 - Niki: No i get that its a weird feeling or not so nice feeling to ende the call because i need to do something. It makes me realize the distance more
23.09.23, 22:14 - Niki: I will try not sure what you mean though
23.09.23, 22:15 - Niki: Yeah get that too. Its always shitty to say goodbye.
23.09.23, 22:17 - Niki: My phone dieing didnt help the howl feeling shitty about it either. In contrast it nade it worst for me 🥲
23.09.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I definitely don't blame you for having to do something or go somewhere, it makes total sense especially when it wasn't really scheduled or known beforehand that we'd call, it just feels shitty to say goodbye in every situation 😅
23.09.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You really shouldn't feel shitty about it, there's nothing you can do about it or anything like that, it's just not so nice of a situation in general
23.09.23, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uh... okay, an example I've seen before is for example jewellery, let's say you're thinking of buying a necklace or bracelet or whatever the fuck for me but you ask them for help. A question they could ask is if I wear silver or gold. It's a stupid example, I just can't think of anything else right now.
23.09.23, 22:22 - Niki: Yeah no i better get it now. They know more think about the stuff that i would need to know or figure out. Thanks hon for explaining it 🥰
23.09.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you my silly goose ❤️
23.09.23, 22:24 - Niki: I love you too rabbit 🐇❤️
23.09.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex just reminded me that I have to be up and in my car at 8:15... whoops, completely forgot about that
23.09.23, 22:36 - Niki: Goodnight then i geuss honey
23.09.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think you understand the problem here
23.09.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am not at all tired right now
23.09.23, 22:37 - Niki: Well drink some hot milk and take a hot shower
23.09.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah
23.09.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I took a shower earlier today and we don't have milk
23.09.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also definitely did not almost tear down a shelf by trying to kill a mosquito 😅😅😅
23.09.23, 22:39 - Niki: Hon i get the hate but sometimes you go to far to kill the mosquitoes
23.09.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah
23.09.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah
23.09.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How dare you say that
23.09.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mosquitos are horrible
23.09.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If killing one ends up with me getting some painting thrown on top of me, 100% worth it
23.09.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fuck I still have to do my Duolingo
23.09.23, 22:41 - Niki: Welp better keep your streak
23.09.23, 22:42 - Niki: You can also start listening to a pot cast. That make me sleepy sometimes just listening to people talk
23.09.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I could listen to some music for that but I don't really want to sleep yet
23.09.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries hon, I will keep that streak if it kills me
23.09.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm also sorry for not texting you more yesterday, but I also didn't really feel like I had anything to say
23.09.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know if I should feel sorry for that or not, because it's something that just happens but idk
23.09.23, 22:47 - Niki: Yeah i felt it but i was thinking the same thing
23.09.23, 22:48 - Niki: Yeah no dont feel bad about it. Even though i still miss you texts
23.09.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I missed my texts too, but mainly because I missed your replies 😅
23.09.23, 22:49 - Niki: Yeah i should text more dont know how to improve that one though
23.09.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk either honestly, it's just something I grew into 😅
23.09.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sometimes I just feel like sharing a random thing of my day or I just wonder how yours is. It's easy for me but I get that that might not be the case for you
23.09.23, 22:54 - Niki: Will try to think about it a bit more during the day
23.09.23, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's okay if you don't know you know? I love getting messages from you but I also understand that we'll both be incredibly busy from next week on (well, maybe you won't but idk) so it's not that easy. I just don't want to lose you through us both being so busy during school
23.09.23, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want you to feel forced to change yourself for me, though I really do appreciate the efforts in communication a LOT 😘
23.09.23, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did I say something wrong?
23.09.23, 23:17 - Niki: Nope
23.09.23, 23:17 - Niki: Sorry if it seemed that way 😅
23.09.23, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, you just read it and didn't respond so I wasn't entirely sure 😅
23.09.23, 23:18 - Niki: No sorry got another notification and something else came up
23.09.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Happens :)
23.09.23, 23:21 - Niki: I would tell you if i feel forced to do anything no worries hon and i get what you mean. But i still wanna evolve/better myself
23.09.23, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, then let's better ourselves together
23.09.23, 23:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just know I will hate this semester already
23.09.23, 23:29 - Niki: Yup get that feeling too.
23.09.23, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not worried about us, but I'm concerned, does that make sense? Not because we won't be able to make it work, but just to make time. It will hurt until the end of October. And then again until the end of December.
23.09.23, 23:34 - Niki: Yeah no i got that feel exactly the same way
23.09.23, 23:35 - Niki: Yeah its worse than normally if that makes sense

24.09.23, 16:41 - Niki: Ringo is a nice name and it fits just from the looks though
24.09.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It does
24.09.23, 16:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mithra just tried (and succeeded) to escape the garden 🙃
24.09.23, 16:58 - Niki: On a rescued and search mission now?

24.09.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh... and the chickens almost tasted death 😂
24.09.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna drive Alex to her dad's now and then go home

24.09.23, 18:26 - Niki: Nice, you go girl 😘
24.09.23, 20:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do regret not borrowing one of your shirts/hoodies sometimes

24.09.23, 20:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I had any clothes that were big enough I'd offer you the same btw
24.09.23, 20:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Unfortunately I am only average sized 🥲
24.09.23, 20:17 - Niki: I would love to have one of yours mabye we fins one

24.09.23, 20:21 - Niki: Watching a movie with my sister and my mom

24.09.23, 20:22 - Niki: Yeah its nice. What are you up too for tonight?
24.09.23, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing, mentally preparing for tomorrow, probably gonna take a good shower and hope I'm no longer cold after that, change my sheets and go to sleep somewhat early if I can (god knows I won't but trying doesn't hurt)
24.09.23, 20:27 - Niki: Hope you get some good sleep tonight
24.09.23, 20:29 - Niki: A nice warm shower helps alot sometimes. Sadly without me 😅
24.09.23, 20:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sadly without you indeed 🥲

24.09.23, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
24.09.23, 20:37 - Niki: Looks nice but abit thin
24.09.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's very thin but I quite like it that way
24.09.23, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If it's too big it's too much of a hassle
24.09.23, 20:42 - Niki: Nice would love to see it in reality right now 😅
24.09.23, 20:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will probably be too clumsy to be able to take it with me in 5 weeks, but maybe if you're lucky either I keep it intact somehow, or jinte makes me another one I can show you 😂
24.09.23, 20:47 - Niki: Well i will be coming over in December
24.09.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, true, but I meant that I will probably break it by then 😅
24.09.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna try to sleep
24.09.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
24.09.23, 23:11 - Niki: Will do the same

25.09.23, 14:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Where'd he go maybe?
25.09.23, 14:56 - Niki: Uni to his communication course
25.09.23, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, right!
25.09.23, 15:01 - Niki: How was your course today?
25.09.23, 15:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Really interesting, but my brain had a hard time following along at times 😅 it won't be an easy course but I think I'll like it, and the professor is really nice too!

25.09.23, 20:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same!
25.09.23, 20:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex did not expect it to go through tomorrow so there's some last minute planning for DnD necessary 😂
25.09.23, 20:43 - Niki: Nice you go girls. Hope you can get it done or else we play
25.09.23, 20:46 - Niki: *we just play the thinks that come to your mind

25.09.23, 21:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a pretty good evening! Yeah, I'm gonna finish reading my chapter, empty a shelf and also get to my bed soon I think
25.09.23, 21:11 - Niki: Well atleast you both dont feel like it
25.09.23, 21:12 - Niki: You empty a shefl ?
25.09.23, 21:20 - Niki: You got rid of books? Are you sick should i come over right now? Possessed?
25.09.23, 21:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, gotta get started on emptying all the kitchen shelves at some point
25.09.23, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries, I'm not possessed and I didn't get rid of any books (though if that is what I have to do to get you to come over... I may or may not be tempted)
25.09.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Plus I lost the cap of my HVL bottle and I need to find it
25.09.23, 21:27 - Niki: Okay yeah that makes more sense. I thought you empty one of your bookshelf upstairs
25.09.23, 21:27 - Niki: How is the kitchen cleaning up and packing up going?
25.09.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean I probably should but not now... maybe next year 😅
25.09.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're trying to eat all the food in the fridge by Friday, we're gonna fail massively at that, other than that not a lot has happened yet. I still have to start emptying the shelf, still reading my chapter 😅
25.09.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was watching the new season of sex education with my parents and goddamn all the couple's in this episode were so coupley. It made me think of you every single time
25.09.23, 23:00 - Niki: Good luck with that hope you read the chapter now?
25.09.23, 23:00 - Niki: Miss you too and sooo much stuff reminds me of you every day its insane
25.09.23, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, read the chapter and found the bottlecap I was looking for!
25.09.23, 23:02 - Niki: Nice
25.09.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you have planned for tomorrow?
25.09.23, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
25.09.23, 23:40 - Niki: Goodnight rabbit ❤️🐇
25.09.23, 23:41 - Niki: Going to some of the first year stuff

26.09.23, 08:15 - Niki: Good morning Hon hope you had a good night of sleep 😘. Yeah will see. Hope your one course goes well.
26.09.23, 08:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're gonna go check if the second course is really cancelled because we think the professor might be confused 😅
26.09.23, 08:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you're for some reason curious about my exam schedule in January... it's in our calendar
26.09.23, 08:31 - Niki: Damm wtf you got that already. We take a look
26.09.23, 08:31 - Niki: *Will
26.09.23, 08:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, apparently we also have it for July but I'm not gonna look at that until next semester. To be fair, some things about it can still change but it looks pretty definitive for now
26.09.23, 08:37 - Niki: Ah okay but still its insand for my university to do them even a month before they are. I hate the system here
26.09.23, 09:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh... makes sense, but then again having the schedule in the first week of classes already is also pretty damn insane 😅
26.09.23, 09:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also statistics actually seems really interesting, and it's the same professor from yesterday so a good teacher too!
26.09.23, 09:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What activities are you going to today?
26.09.23, 09:54 - Niki: Walk aroumd in university
26.09.23, 09:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice, that's in 5 minutes right? Hope there's some nice people 😘

26.09.23, 12:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😘
26.09.23, 12:38 - Niki: Well it wasnt long and the rest isn't that interesting so i am omw home.
26.09.23, 12:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sad, at least you get to chill at home
26.09.23, 12:44 - Niki: Yeah
26.09.23, 13:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, my class this afternoon really isn't happening, always fun

26.09.23, 13:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
26.09.23, 13:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just heard my mom say to someone on the phone "yeah, she met a German, one from the East. Yeah, you know, it's something different. Maybe you should go abroad too" 😂
26.09.23, 13:54 - Niki: Well yeah worked for you, "One from the East" xD
26.09.23, 13:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Technically she used a different word but I have no clue how to translate it to English 😅 "Oostblokker"?
26.09.23, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And yes, it works splendidly for me, thank you very much, I'm very happy 😘
26.09.23, 13:55 - Niki: Yeah we got the same i thing its the same in english
26.09.23, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course you do 😂
26.09.23, 13:55 - Niki: Yeah would trade the Norway and everything that comes with it for anything.
26.09.23, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna assume you meant so say "for nothing" 😘
26.09.23, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But same, I would do it a thousand times again
26.09.23, 14:21 - Niki: Yes 😅
26.09.23, 16:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What changed?
26.09.23, 16:31 - Niki: Forgot that the first year gaming night was today 🥲

26.09.23, 16:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just to let you know
26.09.23, 16:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The delivery of "can we move DnD to Thursday" is pretty tone-deaf in a group chat
26.09.23, 16:34 - Niki: Any idea what i should write?
26.09.23, 16:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not to the other people, that makes total sense, but towards me you silly goose
26.09.23, 16:35 - Niki: Yeah i am kinda really bad at those things 😅. And love you hon 😘
26.09.23, 16:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I figured, I'm not mad about it, but I am slightly annoyed that you wouldn't give me a heads up first
26.09.23, 16:39 - Niki: Yeah will do the next time. Your should get a notic first and i would also be upset about it. Sorry i know that if i fuck something up you will always be there and i love you for that. I will also be always there for you. Even if its only forgetting a date 😅
26.09.23, 16:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, that's all I need. I love you too hon 😘
26.09.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're gonna have to make it up to me on the date part though 😊
26.09.23, 16:42 - Niki: Will do 😘

26.09.23, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know the movie where the girls who sleep with the guy find the "one" right after they sleep with him? Like that movie
26.09.23, 17:07 - Niki: That would be hilarious 😂
26.09.23, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

29.09.23, 12:41 - Niki: ah dont know if i want to but we will seee
29.09.23, 12:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know either but I think it would be slightly funny 😂
29.09.23, 12:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe our 'friendship' doesn't last until then though 😊
29.09.23, 12:42 - Niki: yeah probably
29.09.23, 12:42 - Niki: xD
29.09.23, 14:52 - Niki: You know what endometriose is?
29.09.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, one of my mom's friends has it
29.09.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why do you ask?
29.09.23, 14:59 - Niki: Saw a post on Instagram about it. The daughter of my parents friends shared a post of it and i had no idea what it is. So yeah no idea what it is but sounds really bad and shitty. Can you explain some about it please 😘
29.09.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing, I'll tell you about it after my class 😘
29.09.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I love my teacher for private law btw)
29.09.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will tell you about him later too
29.09.23, 15:00 - Niki: Thanks hon also take your time you can tell me more about it tomorrow. I know your business schedule its fine
29.09.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, I should have the time for it 😘
29.09.23, 16:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay so basically when you have a womb, every month before the menstruation, the wall of the womb thickens. This is a specific kind of tissue that then breaks off again after ovulation and causes the bleeding to happen, as well as cramps and all that. With endometriosis, this tissue isn't only inside of the womb, but can also grow on the outside or on other parts. The issue with this is that every month when menstruation happens, this tissue also breaks off and bleeds, without a straight away escape like it usually does. This causes a shit ton of pain and usually heavier bleeding and cramps. Very often it is overlooked for years because the general conception of menstrual pain is that it is painful, so usually both women, the people around them and doctors assume it is normal. However, women with endometriosis usually are in so much pain they can not get through the day without painkillers, and sometimes have such debilitating pain that they can not walk or basically do anything. It's also a lot harder to get pregnant
29.09.23, 16:19 - Niki: okay that will take me a while to read
29.09.23, 16:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing hon, take your time 😘
29.09.23, 16:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you have any more questions feel free to ask
29.09.23, 16:20 - Niki: will do thanks for explaining already
29.09.23, 16:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anytime my love ❤️
29.09.23, 16:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will also very simply tell you about my law professor because man... he's an _experience_
29.09.23, 16:28 - Niki: okay i will have some things to read then
29.09.23, 16:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One of the first things he said "it's totally fine if you're drunk in my class, but maybe don't take ketamine, because I heard on the radio this morning it's not good and it's for horses, and I think you would be quite offended if I called you a horse"
29.09.23, 16:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Take all the time you want
29.09.23, 16:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: "you guys can laugh at me, that's what I'm being paid for, and that's practically the only thing"
29.09.23, 16:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: "I am technically fully unnecessary, you can learn everything from the book. Actually, now I think about it, maybe I should just be doing ketamine at my bureau"
29.09.23, 16:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: "Shit, Oh, I shouldn't curse. I would say it's not allowed by the church but I think I can't say that anymore either"
29.09.23, 16:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then the guy was looking for someone who's parents own a company (mind you there's like 600 people in this auditorium so obviously no one wants to speak up) so of course I put my hand up because I felt bad for him, so now everyone in that room knows my parents' company's fiscal name 😅 and I found out that speaking in front of so many people apparently is a very disturbing thing to do, but also it apparently made Arne respect me which was interesting
29.09.23, 19:34 - Niki: Okay thats really interesting and you know hoe they find it out in the ende. Hope your mom's friend xan pife with it.
29.09.23, 19:39 - Niki: Nice and get that
29.09.23, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, she's doing fine now, had IVF and got twins + going into menopause so it's not that big of an issue anymore
29.09.23, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, at least wait to answer if it's gonna be this dry 😭😂
29.09.23, 20:43 - Niki: IVF?
29.09.23, 20:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's an alternative way to get pregnant, but kinda complicated to explain 😅
29.09.23, 21:12 - Niki: Ah okay i think i know it
29.09.23, 21:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Invitro fertilization I think
29.09.23, 21:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the party?
29.09.23, 21:21 - Niki: Its nice
29.09.23, 23:04 - Niki: We meet the friends of Daniela or atleast 2 of them and her sister. Her sister is a real introvert complete opposite of Daniela. The friends is a introvert too kinda crazy
29.09.23, 23:04 - Niki: How was the first aid course and meeting up with alex?
29.09.23, 23:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like that could have been a bit boring, I hope it wasn't. There were a lot of other people there too or not?
29.09.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was interesting, but I can do CPR now, which is always good to know, although I imagine it's very different from doing it on a real person and I hope I never have to do that 😅
29.09.23, 23:15 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
29.09.23, 23:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There is a German version????

30.09.23, 14:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So they only see each other whenever he has free time, especially because she's still studying and they want their kids to have a stable home life so they go to school here too
30.09.23, 14:16 - Niki: Damm yeah i would hate that because you dont know when it ends
30.09.23, 14:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm sure they don't like it either, but it is what it is 😅

01.10.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I realised just now that it might come across that way but I'm not 😅😘
01.10.23, 12:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's hard to explain over text and you wanted to take a nap so do that first okay? We can talk about it later, it has to do with my visit to Aeneas yesterday as well

02.10.23, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It also feels very retro, and I think we should make a picture book with them 😅

02.10.23, 18:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When do you have to babysit your nephew?

02.10.23, 20:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Listening to my parents and aunt + Pieter talk about buying the house next to us... crazy
02.10.23, 20:53 - Niki: Yeah it still sounded to me like a distant thing.
02.10.23, 20:54 - Niki: You couldn't go after the dinner?
02.10.23, 20:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not, they're actually bidding on it and everything 😅

03.10.23, 07:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He knows I told you a bit about it already so that's probably why. Yeah, he told me he's worried about his friends too. That he wants to come over next year is nice 😊

03.10.23, 09:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's your last day before your classes start right?
03.10.23, 09:03 - Niki: Yes
03.10.23, 09:04 - Niki: Probably helping alex with the new room and relaxing but we will see
03.10.23, 09:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the room looking?
03.10.23, 09:06 - Niki: Well the room is still a bit dirty and we need to paint it. Also change the lights and move some stuff out but then it should be ready
03.10.23, 09:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 1-2 more days work then I guess?
03.10.23, 09:08 - Niki: Yeah but we dont have the paint and today is national holiday so yeah we will ses
03.10.23, 09:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh right, I completely forgot today is the German national holiday... congratulations? 😂
03.10.23, 09:10 - Niki: Nobody really celebrates it so. Yeah thanks 😅
03.10.23, 09:10 - Niki: At classes right now hon❤️?
03.10.23, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, statistics.... I can't focus 🥲 this is a terrible class to have right now
03.10.23, 09:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also still have private law and mathematics later today 🥲
03.10.23, 09:13 - Niki: Damm hon atleast try to take some notes you got this hon 😘
03.10.23, 09:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am taking notes, no worries
03.10.23, 09:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm trying a lot but my brain is just dead or something
03.10.23, 09:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you're not answering because you think I'll be more distracted then, you would be wrong
03.10.23, 09:49 - Niki: You can read me pretty well 🥲😅
03.10.23, 09:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd fucking hope so at this point
03.10.23, 09:50 - Niki: Why did i read this with the most Australian voice i can think of
03.10.23, 09:50 - Niki: But how is the class going?
03.10.23, 09:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know honestly, but it's incredibly funny
03.10.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's going I guess, it's about measuring predictability and trustworthiness of an analysis
03.10.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But we have a small break now
03.10.23, 09:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not complicated in its essence, so the exercise classes are the thing I should focus on more in this topic
03.10.23, 09:52 - Niki: Nice how is your feeling over all right now?
03.10.23, 09:52 - Niki: Sounds like a plan
03.10.23, 09:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can not be bothered with people today. Celine seems to be the only exception but that's mainly because we both focus on our own shit. And you of course 😘
03.10.23, 09:55 - Niki: Nice dont forget to eat and drink alot please. Love you little rabbit 🐇❤️
03.10.23, 09:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll be happy to know I ate breakfast, I packed lunch and we're eating dinner at my grandma's tonight so I will eat enough and I think I'm doing well drinking too. Love you too, sweet goose 🥰🪿

03.10.23, 12:44 - Niki: Good job still

03.10.23, 14:40 - Niki: Brussels to Prague set for ‘sometime’ in 2024. yeah
03.10.23, 14:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
03.10.23, 14:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 'sometime' doesn't inspire much confidence but if it's as cheap as the other 2 it would be pretty nice
03.10.23, 14:40 - Niki: yup
03.10.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What up?
03.10.23, 23:06 - Niki: Playing games with the others and on your side of the world

04.10.23, 08:20 - Niki: Yeah he isnt coming and the rest of the day was canceled 🥲

04.10.23, 08:22 - Niki: Nah the rest of the prof wrote us a mail
04.10.23, 08:22 - Niki: Yes
04.10.23, 08:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They all wanted a longer holiday 😅
04.10.23, 08:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fun fact, I am all by myself today, because I have 2 practice classes and Celine and Arne are in neither of them 🙃 lunch of 1.5 hour by myself 😶

04.10.23, 09:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you gonna do with all that time now?
04.10.23, 09:57 - Niki: Look at my course and doing some university stuff mabye some website stuff
04.10.23, 09:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have to do the course by yourself because the teacher didn't show up?
04.10.23, 10:01 - Niki: no he didnt send us anythink
04.10.23, 10:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice
04.10.23, 10:58 - Niki: How is your course?
04.10.23, 11:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Too fast
04.10.23, 11:00 - Niki: Good luck then 🍀
04.10.23, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have had 9 hours of maths and no time to go over anything I saw so far... I'm fucked
04.10.23, 11:20 - Niki: Well the weekend i guess. Mabye find a groub that do the math works
04.10.23, 11:20 - Niki: Could you also send me some of it kinda Interesse what you do there
04.10.23, 11:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know literally no one in my class except Celine and Arne and they are way too good at it I don't want to sit next to Arne anymore because he just makes fun of me.
04.10.23, 11:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah sure, I can do that but it'll have to wait until Thursday when I actually have the syllabus 😅
04.10.23, 11:21 - Niki: Asshole and you will find some people i am sure if you look for it abit. Mabye a whatsgroup
04.10.23, 11:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, we have a collective discord where no one has even said anything so far, I sincerely doubt it. But I'll go to the Monitoraat tomorrow for tutoring so hopefully that helps some
04.10.23, 11:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, he's a bitch (derogatory) yesterday during class I made an exercise the right way, he told me I was wrong and then it turned out I was right anyway, fucking ruined my concentration and the feeling that I was doing anything good 😅
04.10.23, 12:34 - Niki: Well bitch be bitching
04.10.23, 12:34 - Niki: Start asking i geuss?
04.10.23, 12:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think you severely underestimate the limits I would go to not to have to start a conversation with someone I don't know
04.10.23, 12:35 - Niki: Okay even right in a discord?
04.10.23, 12:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm
04.10.23, 12:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably
04.10.23, 12:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will see
04.10.23, 12:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If the tutoring doesn't help maybe
04.10.23, 12:43 - Niki: or you have a tutor ?
04.10.23, 12:43 - Niki: *oh
04.10.23, 12:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really, it's set up remedial classes you can join so I'll do that every Thursday probably
04.10.23, 12:45 - Niki: Ah nice hope that help. They only there for questions ? By the way never headed the word remedial. No worries i use the power of the internet
04.10.23, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess so? From what I understand they go over the theory again in "human language" and then you can ask them questions
04.10.23, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's only an hour and 15 minutes so there's only so much they can do
04.10.23, 12:47 - Niki: Okay but sounds nice hope it helps.
04.10.23, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll let you know if it does
04.10.23, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
04.10.23, 12:48 - Niki: Going over the courses and finally sending emails to the professor.
04.10.23, 12:49 - Niki: By the way i played mtg with aeneas yesterday online and was really nice

04.10.23, 12:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm walking there already, no worries
04.10.23, 12:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That sounds nice! How does that work, you get a random deck assigned?
04.10.23, 12:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am freezing, why is it cold here? Actually it's not that cold here, I just am cold for some reason
04.10.23, 12:53 - Niki: No you choose one and play test it. And we screen share our pcs
04.10.23, 12:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oohh, okay, cool!
04.10.23, 12:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd have to see it to fully understand it but it sounds interesting
04.10.23, 12:54 - Niki: Nop but i get that it was always like 20 degrees and now it drops to like 10 and abit above ita crazy

04.10.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kind of? It's not really dancing, it's flexibility and mobility training, coupled with a little bit of unintentional arm workout exercises 😂
Thanks love, it was really nice 😊
04.10.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
04.10.23, 18:59 - Niki: Asoka

05.10.23, 22:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, yeah, no it's not... might have something to do with the fact that it was Lennie who was there, we're still awkward very often if we're alone for some reason 😅

05.10.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, can you believe me when I say it's even worse with Pieter? Both of us are atrocious at being social or small talk, at least with Lennie she's kinda good at it 😅

07.10.23, 11:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, she says I need a new jacket 😅
07.10.23, 11:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I also have heard a lot of people say that. Alex's brother got it 2 weeks ago, it's crazy
07.10.23, 11:11 - Niki: Yeah also hear that a lot but i am allways to lazy
07.10.23, 11:12 - Niki: Oh he is good ?
07.10.23, 11:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same, that's why she wants to go with me 😂
07.10.23, 11:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, he's fine, he was even allowed to go to school but was too lazy to do so 😂
07.10.23, 11:12 - Niki: Well to be sure yeah xD
07.10.23, 11:13 - Niki: Well yeah take the excuse as they come 😅
07.10.23, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah well, he wasn't allowed to stay home from the doctor so that's a bunch of unregistered absences which isn't great, but oh well
07.10.23, 11:14 - Niki: Well yeah that sucks alot
07.10.23, 11:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My parents are redecorating the downstairs area now that the floor is done
07.10.23, 11:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It looks quite nice, but also a bit funny because my dad placed cardboard on the floor where the kitchen will be
07.10.23, 11:20 - Niki: xD
07.10.23, 11:20 - Niki: Sounds great if you have the energy some sneak photos 😅

07.10.23, 12:04 - Niki: Huh why?
07.10.23, 12:04 - Niki: What did i do?
07.10.23, 12:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing, I just fucked up my words and my mom was joking along with it 😅😂
07.10.23, 12:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I said I went to a first aid course but both my mom and Laura understood "first dates"
07.10.23, 12:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So my mom went along with it joking "oh, I didn't know you were going on dates"
07.10.23, 12:21 - Niki: Oh okay 😂 well you can show me what you learned from your "date courses" 😘
07.10.23, 12:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will do, I can definitely reanimate you ;)
07.10.23, 14:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

07.10.23, 14:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad and I are bitching exactly about the way the couch is standing right now 😂
07.10.23, 14:48 - Niki: Also the kitchen stuff in the background 😅
07.10.23, 14:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah there's still a lot to do but at least we can kind of live here again
07.10.23, 14:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
07.10.23, 14:50 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.10.23, 14:50 - Niki: And website working on the side
07.10.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How long can you watch that movie??? 😂
07.10.23, 14:51 - Niki: Ate food in between
07.10.23, 14:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, that movie can not be that long 😂
07.10.23, 14:51 - Niki: And hung out with my parents for like a hout
07.10.23, 14:51 - Niki: 2,30
07.10.23, 14:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough on that part
07.10.23, 15:51 - Niki: How is your day going? How are you feeling about your health?
07.10.23, 15:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going alright, fucking hated shopping with Laura though 😅
My health is the same as this morning, just my nose being annoying. 
How's your day going my love?
07.10.23, 15:54 - Niki: Okayish kinda procrastinating working on the website. But else everything is fine. You also going shopping with your mom later?
07.10.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, we're both procrastinating together then, I still have to study 🥲
Nah, my mom wants to take a nap instead and I fully support her in that
07.10.23, 15:56 - Niki: Yeah just relaxing is really nice 😅. Feel that
07.10.23, 15:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Arg... I don't want to study 😭 it's only been the second week and I have a shit ton to do, uni sucks
07.10.23, 16:22 - Niki: Yeah its annoying as fuck but i am sure you got it when you study a bit 😘
07.10.23, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're my best everything
07.10.23, 16:52 - Niki: Your mine too ❤️
07.10.23, 18:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You want some gossip to do with Jinte? It's nothing much but kinda funny
07.10.23, 18:39 - Niki: Tell hon i am always open for gossip especially if its about jinte
07.10.23, 18:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's on an opening weekend of her student association, the one her ex was part of, but also the one her friends with benefits and his friends with benefits are part of
07.10.23, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So apparently they're hanging out with the 3 of them a lot (the fwb's)
07.10.23, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The girl, Nyah, and the guy Alex (there's too many damn Alex's in the world) are acting really close so pretty much everyone thinks they have something going on
07.10.23, 18:42 - Niki: Man her life is like a fucking romance movie. Where the perfect just doesn't show up
07.10.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It really is
07.10.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: However it gets better
07.10.23, 18:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The other 2 apparently ran naked through a corn field this morning at 5am
07.10.23, 18:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex keeps trying to get both of them close to him, and Nyah has been saying that Jinte and her should just make out but keeps chickening out once she said it
07.10.23, 18:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So now I'm trying to get Jinte to take the initiative and make out with her first 😂
07.10.23, 18:44 - Niki: So Alex wants to have a treesome. Sounds kinda weird over all
07.10.23, 18:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And considering the amount of alcohol and the lack of sleep all of them have, I think there's a 70% chance they make out after all
07.10.23, 18:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, yeah, he does 😂
Jinte told me him and Nyah thought about it but she wasn't entirely up to it yet
07.10.23, 18:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Though if it ever happened I would not be surprised in the least
07.10.23, 18:46 - Niki: Does jinte even whats the treesome. Because last time it didnt see that way.
07.10.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would have a shit ton of questions though, but mainly about the way that works and how awkward it was
07.10.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh honey
07.10.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know she looks like a child
07.10.23, 18:46 - Niki: *Wants
07.10.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooohh
07.10.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
07.10.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, that's what I said, Jinte isn't up to that
07.10.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For a couple of reasons
07.10.23, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 1) after her ex she is kinda traumatized when it comes to sex
07.10.23, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 2) she doesn't feel comfortable enough with Nyah yet
07.10.23, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 3) she hasn't even had sex with Alex yet so that would be a massive leap in actions
07.10.23, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 4) she's kinda freaking out about being in a FWB situation in the first place
07.10.23, 18:48 - Niki: Ah okay well then i think she wouldn't be influenced enough to start anything to be honest.
07.10.23, 18:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, the making out yes, she would do that
07.10.23, 18:48 - Niki: We can also call if you have the time and we can talk about it
07.10.23, 18:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, okay
07.10.23, 18:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😊
07.10.23, 18:49 - Niki: I am ready anytime
07.10.23, 19:43 - Niki: https://www.awi.de/expedition/schiffe/polarstern.html
07.10.23, 23:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am getting a plan B for your birthday present because apparently my mom thinks it's stupid 🙃 and now I'm not sure about it anymore either, well, I wasn't sure of it in the first place but ya know, that's just how it works
07.10.23, 23:25 - Niki: Okay sounds like a plan. Just saying anything you will get me i will like because its from you.

I also thought for a second you will get a plan b(anti-baby-pill) for my birthday. Which confused me for a few seconds 😅😂
07.10.23, 23:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh dear
07.10.23, 23:25 - Niki: Sorry to hear that your mom dislikes the present though
07.10.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do keep forgetting that has a second meaning 😂
07.10.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhhh, it's a difference in taste I guess
07.10.23, 23:26 - Niki: Yeah probably everybody thinks a bit different 😅
07.10.23, 23:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just want to get you something you'll like, not just because it came from me but because of the thing itself as well
07.10.23, 23:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably yeah, I don't know a lot of people that would think of the anti conception pill at first thought though, then again we do have a cafe in Gent with the same name so that doesn't really say a lot
07.10.23, 23:28 - Niki: No worrys your presence is the best present you can get me so yeah you all ready got what i want 🥰❤️
07.10.23, 23:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean technically I didn't though, I wasn't there on Friday 🥲😘
07.10.23, 23:29 - Niki: My phone is about to die and i have my charger in the kitchen 😅
07.10.23, 23:29 - Niki: Well you will come over no worrys
07.10.23, 23:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fun fact, I told my mom about your birthday being yesterday and she literally went "oh no, I forgot to wish him a happy birthday" so there's that 😅
07.10.23, 23:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sad... goodnight then?
07.10.23, 23:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I definitely will
07.10.23, 23:29 - Niki: Goodnight my love ❤️
07.10.23, 23:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing could stop me
07.10.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon, love you loads ❤️
08.10.23, 09:13 - Niki: Good morning rabbit 🐇❤️. Hope you have a great time at the first aid course or did you felt like shit and didn't go?
08.10.23, 09:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning my love 😘
I kind of forgot to put my alarm so I didn't have the choice, I just woke up 😅🥲 (probably wasn't gonna go anyway though, I'd had to give these people a cold too)
08.10.23, 09:18 - Niki: Okay then relax some and rest so the cold goes away fast
08.10.23, 09:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon, but I'll probably be studying most of the time 😅
What are you up to today? Any more classic movies you want to watch?
08.10.23, 09:25 - Niki: Nope not yet mabye later some movies. Need to work on the website today. So yeah will see

08.10.23, 09:26 - Niki: Thanks hon ❤️ good luck with studying 😘
08.10.23, 09:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you 🥰
08.10.23, 09:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently jinte got fucked up drunk last night
08.10.23, 09:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But not as bad as Alex last year
08.10.23, 09:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just threw up 3 times
08.10.23, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And didn't sleep whatsoever
08.10.23, 09:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This mainly because her previous record of drinking was 3 pints and now she had multiple cocktails with vodka and rum... and probably beer before that... 😅
08.10.23, 09:44 - Niki: Yeah should stick to one drink the howl evening
08.10.23, 09:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
08.10.23, 09:45 - Niki: Well she is gone hate today's morning but else she will get back up 😅
08.10.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, apparently she feels fine so far
08.10.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like is said, she did not sleep at all
08.10.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *I
08.10.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Her mom however is not gonna be happy if she finds out (which I really hope she doesn't)
08.10.23, 09:49 - Niki: Well just lie and go around the topic. I believe in jinte to lie good enough
08.10.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I'm sure I'll hear about it so I'll let you know what happens 😅
08.10.23, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You there's something called weed lube??
08.10.23, 09:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: People invent the craziest shit
08.10.23, 09:54 - Niki: What the fuck?
08.10.23, 09:59 - Niki: For what is the weed lube 🫣?
08.10.23, 10:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For what do you think people use lube?
08.10.23, 10:04 - Niki: Okay yeah thats what i thought
08.10.23, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm buying a purple dress, I guess my pimp era continues 😂
08.10.23, 11:30 - Niki: Sounds nice. Maybe i could see a picture 🫣🥰
08.10.23, 11:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll do so once I get home, we're gonna check out now 😘
08.10.23, 11:32 - Niki: Okay i am excited to see. I Feel like a child waiting for Christmas ❤️🥰
08.10.23, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie 🥰

08.10.23, 11:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or both 😅

08.10.23, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's it about? I don't think I know this one.

Ohhh please hon could you do some school work for me 🥺 ?
08.10.23, 19:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're really cute, but unless there's someone actively looking if I'm doing work it's gonna be difficult I'm afraid 😅
08.10.23, 19:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll try again after I eat dinner okay?
08.10.23, 19:29 - Niki: Is that a invite to come over?
08.10.23, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: As if you need an invite for that 😘
08.10.23, 19:30 - Niki: Yeah i don't 😅. Today i was thinking about coming over on your birthday but then i remember the birthday party of my grampa. I was sad all over again 😅🥲
08.10.23, 19:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh hon, no matter how much I wish you could be here, you really have to be there for your grandpa's birthday party and then the week of classes you still have 😘
08.10.23, 19:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: +Christmas, you won't have time to think about it
08.10.23, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 3 fucking weeks
08.10.23, 21:03 - Niki: "Only" 21 days
08.10.23, 21:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse about it honestly
08.10.23, 21:24 - Niki: Ups 😅 well its easier to count down
08.10.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True
08.10.23, 22:28 - Niki: Goodnight rabbit love you ❤️🐇
08.10.23, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love, love you too ❤️😘
08.10.23, 23:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You don't know what I would give to be able to turn around and cuddle up to you when I can't sleep
09.10.23, 08:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon 😘
09.10.23, 08:17 - Niki: Good morning my love ❤️
09.10.23, 08:18 - Niki: On your way to university?

09.10.23, 08:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You?
09.10.23, 08:18 - Niki: Waking up eating breakfast and stuff like that
09.10.23, 08:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Chill, enjoy the relaxing day then 😘
09.10.23, 09:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You don't have class today I see, so what are you up to?
09.10.23, 12:33 - Niki: Sorry forgot to send again 😅. Website stuff and bringing my car to change the Tires. Later today i will drive back to Chemnitz. What are your plans today except courses ?
09.10.23, 12:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna go to a political debate with Alex tonight, other than that nothing planned. I'm home now to eat lunch
09.10.23, 12:46 - Niki: Nice yeah saw the calendar notices. Is it the same as last time with the 4 hour completely different groups ? What you eating for lunch ?
09.10.23, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kind of, it's different people and I think there's gonna 6 participants from different organisations, but it's organised by the same professor as last time
I'm just eating some leftover we still have in our freezer since we still don't really have a functioning kitchen
09.10.23, 12:48 - Niki: Ah nice do you have the prof in any courses ? Yeah well beginning of November the kitchen should come right ?
09.10.23, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, but Alex does. It is in the auditorium I'm most often in though, so that's pretty funny. 
My parents think so but it also depends on everything else that needs to be finished, like the walls and all that.
09.10.23, 12:50 - Niki: Well hope everything goes well with the kitchen then
09.10.23, 12:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, we'll see, if it goes right I'll be with you when the kitchen is placed so I won't be around the mess then
09.10.23, 14:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Drive safe (whenever you go back to Chemnitz) 😘
09.10.23, 15:01 - Niki: Thanks hon i am now in Chemnitz <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
09.10.23, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to perhaps if you don't mind me asking?
09.10.23, 15:03 - Niki: Gone take a shower now and the some food
09.10.23, 15:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahh
09.10.23, 15:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, yeah Chemnitz makes more sense
09.10.23, 15:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I read Leipzig before you edited it 😅
09.10.23, 15:05 - Niki: It was i dont i am kinda through with my mind today 😅
09.10.23, 15:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Happens to the best (proof in case being you 😘)
09.10.23, 15:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy the shower (without me)
09.10.23, 15:52 - Niki: By the way I got a t-shirt on that we wash at you place and i love it. It takes me back a little 🥰
09.10.23, 16:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You are so damn cute 🥺
09.10.23, 16:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It still smells like the washing detergent??
09.10.23, 16:26 - Niki: Yeah but ita smells like your home/your clothes for mw atleast
09.10.23, 16:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Get that, love you ❤️
09.10.23, 16:28 - Niki: Love you too rabbit 🐇❤️

09.10.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Really late lunch, very early dinner or snack?
09.10.23, 17:19 - Niki: Late lunch 😅
09.10.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... honey please
09.10.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ??? I'm guessing you didn't make food after your shower then?
09.10.23, 17:20 - Niki: Nope just procrastinating
09.10.23, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... I can't even say anything about it because I do it too 😭
09.10.23, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, I saw a guy wreck his car
09.10.23, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I always forget what it's called in English but the thing the clutch controls, yeah, he fucked that up massively
09.10.23, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess what he drove?

09.10.23, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No clue, I didn't stick around after it happened
09.10.23, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But let's hope so for him 😅
09.10.23, 17:25 - Niki: Get home savely hon ❤️

09.10.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
09.10.23, 17:26 - Niki: Is Moustache allways there to greet people?
09.10.23, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Imagine a Mercedes getting into a fight with a mini btw, it was funny to watch
09.10.23, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty much
09.10.23, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But right now he's annoying me to get his food

09.10.23, 17:30 - Niki: By the way you now have some Math stuff to show me. Kinda wanna know what math you do?
09.10.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Waiting again? That sucks... you're finally changing out your replacement tire and all the rest or why are you changing them for?
09.10.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing, but maybe it's easier if we call for that?
09.10.23, 17:32 - Niki: New all year tires
09.10.23, 17:32 - Niki: Okay sure now or later?
09.10.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 15 minutes? I have to hang my laundry first 😅
09.10.23, 17:45 - Niki: Yeah jo worries
09.10.23, 17:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, ready when you are 😘

09.10.23, 20:21 - Niki: Man i hate the send button 🥲
09.10.23, 20:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The presenter had them introducing their neighbours and say a positive thing about the other, no preparation 😂 they were tearing each other down, it is beautiful
09.10.23, 20:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's okay hon, I know you do 😘
09.10.23, 20:22 - Niki: Sounds like a great time 🥰
09.10.23, 20:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, it's like a comedy show
09.10.23, 20:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: However also kinda sad to realise that these people make policy, oh well
09.10.23, 20:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man is trying to argue for the splitting up of Belgium now... I was almost feeling bad for him but now I don't at all
09.10.23, 20:51 - Niki: yeah well seems smart xD

09.10.23, 22:40 - Niki: Yeah
09.10.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay

10.10.23, 16:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't you have a meeting with Lara today?
10.10.23, 16:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hon, your calendar changes so quick it's crazy
10.10.23, 16:04 - Niki: Yeah well that one dodmt happen because she caught covid on the weekend
10.10.23, 16:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh shit, that sucks, I hope she gets better soon 🍀
10.10.23, 16:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So many people get covid recently 😅
10.10.23, 16:05 - Niki: Yeah alex and me also taught so. Its kinda crazy
10.10.23, 16:05 - Niki: But the 7 day index isn't that high
10.10.23, 16:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think we don't even have that anymore in Belgium
10.10.23, 16:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you're feeling sick you stay home, otherwise you don't 😅
10.10.23, 16:09 - Niki: Yup
10.10.23, 19:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: bitch
10.10.23, 19:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: my bitch ;p
10.10.23, 19:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: cutie
10.10.23, 19:59 - Niki: hehe
10.10.23, 21:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you looking at handsome?
10.10.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you think my rant is over the top please let me know
10.10.23, 21:32 - Niki: Its abit much and sometimes its better to sleep a night over text like this. But i also totally get the text. It's just some much of a wall of text for some you actually need to have a conversation about.
10.10.23, 21:33 - Niki: I don't wanna start a fight over if they wanna be at dnd or not but yeah its still kinda shity to just send a text like that
10.10.23, 21:34 - Niki: Shity being the he wants to quit text
10.10.23, 21:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want to fight about that either, I hope I made that clear too, I'm just really annoyed at the way he said it
10.10.23, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's also definitely not like Alex and I didn't plan a whole bunch of things that we now have to adjust,, not at all :/
if you guys even still want to play without him?
10.10.23, 21:35 - Niki: Yeah but being annoyed at somerhing and texting about wouldn't help that much. A conversation would be way better or sleeping over it could also help
10.10.23, 21:35 - Niki: Yeah dont know really but we also dont know what the problem is
10.10.23, 21:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sincerely, I don't completely agree on that from a personal perspective because often when I sleep over things I start to think that what I thought before shouldn't be reacted to at all, when in reality it still annoys me but I start overthinking what other people would do in the situation.
10.10.23, 21:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope we find out
10.10.23, 21:37 - Niki: Yeah okay can ve different form person to person
10.10.23, 21:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry, I'm encroaching on the time you want to spend with fabian and Alex, please don't bother with me, spend time with them 😘
10.10.23, 21:37 - Niki: Yeah for sure
10.10.23, 21:37 - Niki: Nah its fine still waiting for them to come back to be honest
10.10.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh really? Where'd they go to?
10.10.23, 21:39 - Niki: Dont know somewhere around here
10.10.23, 21:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very clear
10.10.23, 21:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: calling him right now
10.10.23, 21:54 - Niki: Okay but ask him if he wants to talk now or later / tomorrow mabye he isnt in the mood or has something else goimg on
10.10.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: we're working things out now
10.10.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: this conversation is not going the right direction fuck
10.10.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: and if I say to do this another time he's gonna think he's a bother and never want to do this again
10.10.23, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I already almost pushed too far
10.10.23, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I get what's mainly wrong now though
10.10.23, 22:08 - Niki: Okay its a family matter
10.10.23, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: his mom has cancer. terminal
10.10.23, 22:09 - Niki: Oh fuck

10.10.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: he is also shutting down his emotions...
10.10.23, 22:10 - Niki: Not a good method
10.10.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: no shit
10.10.23, 22:10 - Niki: Mabye a therapist can help? Or just hagimg out with you /your parents
10.10.23, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: he doesn't want to, that's what I pushed too hard on
10.10.23, 22:12 - Niki: Ahh okay any plans tfor tge next weeks?
10.10.23, 22:12 - Niki: Oh his side or anything

10.10.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really can't
10.10.23, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I want to help him but I told you before it is getting too much for me and this definitely is
10.10.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am practically getting an anxiety/panic attack just talking to him over the phone
10.10.23, 22:15 - Niki: Well then you need to tell him that too and mabye shedule another dax or tell Anthony / Jingwen
10.10.23, 22:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't
10.10.23, 22:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm literally trying to convince him we're friends and that I won't just abandon him for going through a shit time
10.10.23, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And quite frankly Anthony and Jingwen have their own problems why he doesn't want to tell them
10.10.23, 22:16 - Niki: Oh damm he is on the level of thinking
10.10.23, 22:16 - Niki: Mabye Ludwig?
10.10.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know him that well to talk to him about this and honey, I understand you're doing this to help me but you're putting a bunch of pressure on me to make this right 😅
10.10.23, 22:18 - Niki: Sorry i am not trying to do that.
10.10.23, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know that
10.10.23, 22:19 - Niki: Just saying your a good friend

10.10.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: he's trying to convince me he'll be fine

10.10.23, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: what do you mean?

10.10.23, 22:27 - Niki: Yeah seems so. But just talk too somebody also help so mabye its getting better

11.10.23, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That would be a deathtrap
11.10.23, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could perhaps be from crying last night and sleeping through it but idk
11.10.23, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honestly don't think so because I've been having bad headaches ever since Monday for some fucking reason
11.10.23, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now it's just a constant one instead of a flash headache 🙃
11.10.23, 13:56 - Niki: Well then it should be over at some point

12.10.23, 22:29 - Niki: Damm the ending of the offer is sooo great loving it alot
12.10.23, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice
12.10.23, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think I remember what happened 😅
12.10.23, 22:35 - Niki: Its great that what i can say
12.10.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have seen it before, but yeah
12.10.23, 22:39 - Niki: I will now watch the godfather again because it got me so hypt for it
12.10.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well
12.10.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No sleep for you then
12.10.23, 22:40 - Niki: Yup
12.10.23, 22:40 - Niki: But yesterday i got like 10 or something so i should be good
12.10.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
12.10.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I fucking hate all of you
12.10.23, 22:41 - Niki: We can still call if you want to
12.10.23, 22:42 - Niki: I thought because of the dinner tonight you didnt want to?
12.10.23, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Huh?
12.10.23, 22:42 - Niki: Well it seems like you wanted to move it
12.10.23, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No I get that
12.10.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am confused why you suddenly ask about it?
12.10.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I did offer to move it because I didn't know how long it was gonna take, and you said to move it to the weekend no?
12.10.23, 22:43 - Niki: This let me second geuss myself to be honest
12.10.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah
12.10.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooh
12.10.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah okay I see the misunderstanding
12.10.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 1) yes I would still like to call but I also think I wouldn't be very good company right now
12.10.23, 22:45 - Niki: Why would you be good company?
12.10.23, 22:45 - Niki: Typ your text till the end just asking
12.10.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 2) that "I hate you all" comment was on the amount of sleep you'd get tonight because Jinte also has a thing with just sleeping a bunch one night and then just not sleeping more than an hour for a few nights and thinking that makes up for it
12.10.23, 22:45 - Niki: Man the texting thing is still confusing me sometimes
12.10.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah me too
12.10.23, 22:46 - Niki: Ah okay well yeah makes sense
12.10.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I don't have a lot of energy, the only reason I would call is because I miss you a lot
12.10.23, 22:47 - Niki: Makes me realize how imported other communication is like ton and face movements
12.10.23, 22:47 - Niki: Yeah okay get that mabye sleep or some podcasts? /just some you can fall asleep too
12.10.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's really important, texting frustrates me a lot sometimes (I'm talking in general)
12.10.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want to
12.10.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm a bit too agitated to
12.10.23, 22:49 - Niki: Same hon same. Not the frustrating part though
12.10.23, 22:49 - Niki: Well i hate myself for texting stupid stuff but oh well
12.10.23, 22:49 - Niki: Huh? Tell me more please?
12.10.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, it's weird, idk how to explain but there's just a bunch of annoying energy in my body (remnants of anxiety) that's stuck in my body and before you try to solve it for me by saying maybe doing something active would work, it doesn't I have tried
12.10.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't
12.10.23, 22:51 - Niki: We can talk about if i you wanna too?
12.10.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mainly meant interpreting messages is really annoying sometimes for me, especially when it has to do with sarcasm. I have a problem to notice it in person, nevermind over text (though to be fair this is usually only the case with people I don't know that well)
12.10.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not sure what there is to talk about
12.10.23, 22:53 - Niki: Okay than i will watch the godfather now hope your energy peace out soon 🥰
12.10.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... Oh honey
12.10.23, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're very silly sometimes
12.10.23, 22:55 - Niki: Huh can you explain? But yeah in general i would agree
12.10.23, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 1) the energy will not go down soon
12.10.23, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 2) I understand why it's so much easier to give advice about relationships than to actually put it into action yourself
12.10.23, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 3) you're bad at catching hints, but that's not your fault, that's on me not wanting to say things straight up
12.10.23, 22:59 - Niki: What does that mean man i getting confused even more?
12.10.23, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... I miss you you fool
12.10.23, 23:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I selfishly want your attention
12.10.23, 23:00 - Niki: I miss you too hon ❤️
12.10.23, 23:00 - Niki: Well you got it
12.10.23, 23:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I don't like saying it straight up because it makes me feel needy and too much
12.10.23, 23:00 - Niki: I am not even swapping out of whats app rigth now.
12.10.23, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I know you will probably say that's ridiculous
12.10.23, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yeah
12.10.23, 23:01 - Niki: Aaah hon you soo cute but well i love you being needy and too much sometimes
12.10.23, 23:02 - Niki: Well its also ridiculous but yeah you already know that
12.10.23, 23:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, one piece of advice but if a woman says she feels needy and too much, it's best not to agree with her in most cases 😂
12.10.23, 23:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think it's cute
12.10.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But someone else might actually get offended over it 😂
12.10.23, 23:03 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
12.10.23, 23:05 - Niki: Damm i am so german like the English is so eughhh
12.10.23, 23:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is why I never listen to anything I record
12.10.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love to hear your voice 🥰
12.10.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You also really don't sound that German
12.10.23, 23:06 - Niki: Yup i se normal but for you its different
12.10.23, 23:06 - Niki: I do for myself i do

12.10.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I get that
12.10.23, 23:09 - Niki: Well for you i wanna sound my best, look my best and show my best side. Just over all be my best ❤️
12.10.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hon, you could have the most cracking voice in the world and I'd still love to listen to it
12.10.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And you look like a goddamn dream anytime I see you
12.10.23, 23:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind how your personality is mainly the reason why I fell in love it you, if that doesn't tell you enough about how great you are
12.10.23, 23:12 - Niki: Hon you make me blush 🥰. Love you too ❤️
12.10.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, you tell a guy he's pretty and that's just the end of the conversation... This is how people on dating apps must feel
12.10.23, 23:18 - Niki: Man i love the hole "ridle me this" with your text there is allways a hidden meaning. Kinda feel like batman try to stop the ridler. (ps this hole text is a sarcastic joke)
12.10.23, 23:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for the clarification hon
12.10.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I appreciate it 😘
12.10.23, 23:19 - Niki: Hehe 🤭

12.10.23, 23:20 - Niki: Text, call, chat or you wanna teleport to me?
12.10.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well I don't want to not to anything with you if you hadn't noticed that yet
12.10.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I could teleport I would have been there already
12.10.23, 23:20 - Niki: Got that
12.10.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good boy
12.10.23, 23:21 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
12.10.23, 23:21 - Niki: Hehe
12.10.23, 23:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can you explain the difference between chat and text to me? Idk if I'm missing something
12.10.23, 23:22 - Niki: Chat is just writing about any thing that comes to mind with out a real topic. Texting is with a topic in mind
12.10.23, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh
12.10.23, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I never thought there was a difference
12.10.23, 23:23 - Niki: Well its just in my mind so i geuss not really anything official
12.10.23, 23:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I want to call because I want to see you but I also don't know what to talk about so you decide
12.10.23, 23:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, I guess it can be official between us then
12.10.23, 23:26 - Niki: Okay hon then lets call

17.10.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The ability to teleport

17.10.23, 22:44 - Niki: Well what are you up to right now?
17.10.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing?
17.10.23, 22:44 - Niki: Did you talk about anything after i left the discord?
17.10.23, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just the outfits for Saturday but nothing else really
17.10.23, 22:45 - Niki: And any plans for the others
17.10.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The others?
17.10.23, 22:45 - Niki: Also i definitely want some pictures of you
17.10.23, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll definitely get some, no worries 😘
17.10.23, 22:46 - Niki: Alex and jinte
17.10.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah
17.10.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I still don't know about Jinte, the fucking demon child doesn't want to tell me shit
17.10.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And Alex doesn't know yet, still has to decide
17.10.23, 22:46 - Niki: Sometimes you are special more so than normally obviously allways in a good wayv😅🥰
17.10.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I might go as the joker after all, but idk, will have to see about the green hair dye
17.10.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean???
17.10.23, 22:47 - Niki: The not getting context from texts
17.10.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well idk, I thought maybe you were asking about Jingwen's plans for the weekend or something
17.10.23, 22:48 - Niki: Oooh sounds interesting but the dye will stay in a few days?
17.10.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, depends on the dye, Alex is looking into it
17.10.23, 22:48 - Niki: Does he have some?
17.10.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because last time I dyed my hair green it was green for 3 months 😅
17.10.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And that was before my hair was bleached so I don't even want to think about how long it could stay in now 😅
17.10.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cleaning up his apartment so he can move out easily, other than that idk
17.10.23, 22:49 - Niki: Dirty me talk but i allways wanted to fuck somebody with colorful hair 😅😳
17.10.23, 22:49 - Niki: Nice
17.10.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... 😳
17.10.23, 22:49 - Niki: Well will see
17.10.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
17.10.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We'll see
17.10.23, 22:50 - Niki: Not sorry for the horny me 😝
17.10.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Never be sorry for horny you 😂
17.10.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😘
17.10.23, 22:50 - Niki: Cutie
17.10.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Says the person who just told me he thinks coloured hair is sexy 😂😘
17.10.23, 22:51 - Niki: Not really just wanted to  fuck somebody with it
17.10.23, 22:52 - Niki: Well specially you to be honest
17.10.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't really see how it would make the experience different but if that's what you're into I'm not questioning it 😘
17.10.23, 22:52 - Niki: After i heard you had green hair befor
17.10.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, like I said, we'll see
17.10.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not gonna lie
17.10.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have thought about dying my hair again
17.10.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just don't know what colour
17.10.23, 22:53 - Niki: Oh okay
17.10.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And if it would work out with my bleached hair
17.10.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I realised last time that it's a good thing most of my closet is black because it really does limit your clothes options sometimes
17.10.23, 22:53 - Niki: Well it should
17.10.23, 22:53 - Niki: Yup get that
17.10.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, according to Alex apparently the hair bleach could make it more difficult for the colour to stick
17.10.23, 22:54 - Niki: I mean you cant. Wear the same color as you hair or atleast hardly
17.10.23, 22:54 - Niki: Oh yeah that could be a problem
17.10.23, 22:55 - Niki: I mean you dont need to wear clothes around me atleast 😘
17.10.23, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is very true 😘
17.10.23, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: However unfortunately I'm not around you all the time 🥲

18.10.23, 12:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She didn't want to tell me because she wanted me to be proud of her, the fool, as if I wouldn't be proud of I knew what it was gonna be. But sweet and cute, I have to say

21.10.23, 09:54 - Niki: Her brother has a bra? Sportsbra?

21.10.23, 10:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *boy
21.10.23, 10:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex's brother just fucked up my shoe... Man
21.10.23, 10:38 - Niki: What did he do? What happened? 
hope you can fix it
21.10.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He put them on because he thought they were his dad's but they were already kind of fucked up and when he took them off he broke the inside of them completely 🥲
21.10.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't fix it I'm afraid 🥲
21.10.23, 10:40 - Niki: Sucks but he didn't realize the size difference. Hope you find a alternative 🙏🏼

22.10.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know you did
22.10.23, 22:23 - Niki: It was potatoes with vegetables and vegetarian meat stuff
22.10.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You enjoyed it?
22.10.23, 22:26 - Niki: Yeah was okay
22.10.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough I guess
22.10.23, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, Anthony started his new job last Monday
22.10.23, 22:27 - Niki: Ah nice
22.10.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, please don't take this as an offence, but I still stand by what I said a while ago, you would have a really hard time finding anyone on a dating app... You have a real talent for just answering in the driest and least interested tone possible, even when I know that's not at all what you meant. It is slightly funny at times
22.10.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know what
22.10.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This sounds offensive as fuck
22.10.23, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh well
22.10.23, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry?
22.10.23, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you and your way of communicating a lot 😘
22.10.23, 22:37 - Niki: Yeah i get that but do you know more about Anthony's job than thats a army job and he is an external engineer?
22.10.23, 22:38 - Niki: But i agree but oh well good thing i got you hon 🥰
22.10.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still waiting for his response on my questions but he says he's still getting used to the new workplace and that it apparently isn't that easy to get used to
22.10.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Him and Claire also still want to come over in December
22.10.23, 22:39 - Niki: Oh really nice nevermind then
22.10.23, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
22.10.23, 22:39 - Niki: When do you know?
22.10.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably for my birthday but I told him we should maybe call to arrange all that
22.10.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll definitely let you know everything he tells me once he does 😘
22.10.23, 22:40 - Niki: Hope he gets use to it i mean it was kinda his dream to work at a military company
22.10.23, 22:40 - Niki: Thanks hon 🥰
22.10.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, true, but any step like this is always kind of difficult to get used to I guess
22.10.23, 22:40 - Niki: Yup sounds good
22.10.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anything for you ❤️
22.10.23, 22:41 - Niki: I am happy you won't be alone on your birthday and a lot of your friends come over
22.10.23, 22:42 - Niki: Sadly i won't be there 🥲
22.10.23, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will miss you being there for sure 🥲❤️
22.10.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But also I don't really care about doing anything for my birthday so I would be perfectly fine just studying with Alex and that just be the end of the day
22.10.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will just miss you being there, but not necessarily so because it's my birthday, simply because I love you being around always
22.10.23, 22:45 - Niki: Ah hon your the most beautiful and adorable person i know and your a treasure in my life that i won't give up 🥰❤️
22.10.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My heartbeat just shot through the roof 😅 you're too sweet hon 🥰❤️
22.10.23, 22:47 - Niki: But i am going to dream of you know 😘
22.10.23, 22:47 - Niki: Goodnight hon love you ❤️
22.10.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope I will dream of you too 😘
22.10.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love, love you a lot too ❤️
23.10.23, 08:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon 😘
23.10.23, 08:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So about Anthony: he has individual assignments so getting to know his colleagues isn't that easy. His commute is only 30 minutes though, which is a great improvement! He is also planning on making a storm trooper costume to go to comic-con or just star wars events
23.10.23, 08:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And him and Claire want to come over in December, don't know about Aeneas because he hasn't said anything about it

25.10.23, 19:03 - Niki: What did he say to you?
25.10.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
25.10.23, 19:04 - Niki: I just sayed that you would like to have Daniela with you because alone as a girl is weird
25.10.23, 19:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does it seem from the message Alex sent me like that was the only thing you said?
25.10.23, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or did he really just grasp that out of context?
25.10.23, 19:07 - Niki: I think so but i told him that i would need to talk to you about it
25.10.23, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Talk to me about what? The swimming?
25.10.23, 19:07 - Niki: Yeah the Swimming
25.10.23, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
25.10.23, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He apparently took that upon himself and then also just casually mentioned my body insecurities 🙃
25.10.23, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay you know what
25.10.23, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have to cycle home now
25.10.23, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I am hungry

25.10.23, 19:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's the absolute last thing I want
25.10.23, 19:32 - Niki: Okay
25.10.23, 19:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can't just okay that
25.10.23, 19:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm serious
25.10.23, 19:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I ever do anything remotely non pleasant towards you you have to hold me accountable
25.10.23, 19:34 - Niki: I will not be scared anymore and i love you too. I will but i am a very understanding person to the point its not understanding anymore. I am just that way.
25.10.23, 19:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay sorry, I'm way too emotional right now and I need food and water and idk, hugs I guess
25.10.23, 19:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know that's how you are, but it also slightly scares me how understanding you seem to be sometimes
25.10.23, 19:35 - Niki: Would love to give you everything but not there yet
25.10.23, 19:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sunday
25.10.23, 19:35 - Niki: It sucks sometimes to be honest. I kinda wanna change that but its for some reason hard.
25.10.23, 19:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's getting out of your comfort zone, that's never simple unfortunately
25.10.23, 20:27 - Niki: Hon how are you doing? Did you eat dinner jet?
25.10.23, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well
25.10.23, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have a bunch of things to tell you at some point
25.10.23, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eating croques at my aunt's place now with the family
25.10.23, 20:32 - Niki: Have fun with your famliy
25.10.23, 20:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The bunch of things has nothing to do with our conversation from earlier btw
25.10.23, 20:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also food makes me feel a lot better about it
25.10.23, 20:35 - Niki: Yeah i taught so. Hope its good news.
25.10.23, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hah... Yeah, nah 😅
25.10.23, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's interesting
25.10.23, 20:39 - Niki: okay then i will be waiting for the interesting news my lady 😅😘
25.10.23, 21:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie 🥰
25.10.23, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got home
25.10.23, 22:18 - Niki: How was the dinner with your parents
25.10.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dinner was nice, but I ate too much 😅
25.10.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gonna take a shower now, will tell you what happened later
25.10.23, 22:33 - Niki: Okay sadly with out me
25.10.23, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sadly indeed
25.10.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So basically
25.10.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Remember when I said I would be superstitious if the guy died?
25.10.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, now I have all reason to be superstitious
25.10.23, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: However
25.10.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (this feels slightly disrespectful because the guy is dead and the saying goes "don't speak ill of the dead" however telling the truth isn't speaking ill, is it?)
25.10.23, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There is more to the story
25.10.23, 22:51 - Niki: okay yeah superstitious is real
25.10.23, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It turns out his partner ,who we know because they work together, and him were together for 5 years in a LAT relationship and he told her his wife died in 2004
25.10.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At the hospital when she was sitting by his bed, his wife turns up... So the guy was living a whole double life, having a whole wife and kids without her knowledge
25.10.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And those kids apparently helped them out on a couple of jobs and just never said or noticed anything?
25.10.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now she isn't allowed to go anywhere near him (or well, his body I suppose)
25.10.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a fucking mess
25.10.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I feel really bad for her
25.10.23, 22:53 - Niki: Crazy wtf
25.10.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also apparently out of our family, I was the last one to see him alive 🙃
25.10.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
25.10.23, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also about the talking later, it's mainly just because I don't want to talk about this over text, if anything it should be at least over a video call
25.10.23, 22:56 - Niki: Yeah get that i was not thiinking about him though
25.10.23, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean?
25.10.23, 23:02 - Niki: The news you wanted to talk about
25.10.23, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm confused sorry, you weren't thinking about the news I told you which was the guy that died or? I'm sorry I don't know what you mean 🥲
25.10.23, 23:07 - Niki: When you told me about the news you wanted to talk in person I was not thinking about him. I was thinking about a dead person though
25.10.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no
25.10.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry
25.10.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's not what I meant
25.10.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't mean I want to talk about any news in person
25.10.23, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I meant about our conversation from earlier tonight
25.10.23, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not that I want to fight about it or that I want to talk about it more for no reason because quite frankly it happened and that's just the situation now, but it made me come to an important realisation I want to talk to you about.
25.10.23, 23:12 - Niki: Okay, will do that in person. When or just the next time we talk
25.10.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd rather do that in person, we'll see, maybe on Sunday.
25.10.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record, it's nothing necessary bad, it's just something I feel like we should talk about it
25.10.23, 23:16 - Niki: okay i will probably still worry abit
25.10.23, 23:17 - Niki: but its fine really
25.10.23, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know hon, I'm sorry, but I really don't feel comfortable talking about this over text, maybe if we call but idk, I want to make sure we're both comfortable to talk about it
25.10.23, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doesn't sound like it's fine 😅
25.10.23, 23:18 - Niki: It just needs to get this in my head so i know its nothing bad
25.10.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not bad
25.10.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I promise
25.10.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not good either
25.10.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's kinda neutral, more something I'd like your opinion on
25.10.23, 23:19 - Niki: Let me read this text a few times and i will get it no worrys
25.10.23, 23:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 🥲
25.10.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't want to worry you, sorry
25.10.23, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe I shouldn't have said anything about it 😅
25.10.23, 23:20 - Niki: You should and only if its about you i will worrry about this kind of stuff
25.10.23, 23:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, still wish I could hug you and/or just talk to you right now about this though, I know it would be a relief for both of us
25.10.23, 23:22 - Niki: ^Yes would take any hug from you <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
25.10.23, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't like going to sleep feeling like anything is unfinished between us
25.10.23, 23:31 - Niki: Its okay hon i got it
25.10.23, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I'm tired and today it's not gonna happen anymore, so there's no other option here I guess
25.10.23, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you and I can't wait until Sunday to see you and hug you and kiss you again. I miss you so much it hurts sometimes
25.10.23, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
25.10.23, 23:33 - Niki: Love you too hon and same i just wanna hug you so badly. Kiss you again will feel like Christmas as a child over and over again so i cant wait for that either.

26.10.23, 13:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no
26.10.23, 13:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The flexibility and mobility thing
26.10.23, 13:19 - Niki: Ah okay
26.10.23, 13:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dance is just shorter so that's what I call it
26.10.23, 13:20 - Niki: Get that
26.10.23, 13:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you actually do any sports right now,'
26.10.23, 13:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *?
26.10.23, 13:20 - Niki: How was the chiropractor did you grow abit again?
26.10.23, 13:20 - Niki: Nope I wanted to but the course are shitty this year
26.10.23, 13:21 - Niki: Should go atleast to the gym but didnt find the motivation yet
26.10.23, 13:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't check but it feels better than before
26.10.23, 13:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe put aside a specific moment in the week you want to go?
26.10.23, 13:24 - Niki: Yeah should sounds like a good idea
26.10.23, 14:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Celine says I eat fast
26.10.23, 14:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which means the speed at which you eat is ridiculously fast
26.10.23, 14:44 - Niki: Well yeah hear that alot
26.10.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aeneas found an apartment
26.10.23, 15:02 - Niki: Nice is it a nice one
26.10.23, 15:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know
26.10.23, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Haven't read the full text yet
26.10.23, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just thought you might want to know
26.10.23, 15:03 - Niki: You think the plan with December is still on
26.10.23, 15:04 - Niki: Yes thanks
26.10.23, 15:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, will talk to you later, am in math now
26.10.23, 16:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also did you send him a message?
26.10.23, 16:04 - Niki: Nope i didnt
26.10.23, 16:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 🙃
26.10.23, 16:10 - Niki: Will do it
26.10.23, 16:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure
26.10.23, 16:13 - Niki: But just saying i have no real idea what iam gonna say
26.10.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey
26.10.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You don't have to say anything about how he's feeling if you don't want to
26.10.23, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But maybe just say you heard about the apartment from me or something? And you could maybe play some games together if there's time for that, you don't have to do anything emotionally intensive if you don't feel like that
26.10.23, 16:14 - Niki: Okay thanks for the ideas
26.10.23, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I do think it's good practice to just keep up to date and actually do something with him especially now we don't play DnD together anymore
26.10.23, 16:15 - Niki: Yeah definitely
26.10.23, 16:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Math continues, those who are dying greet you
26.10.23, 16:17 - Niki: Okay hope you get out semi alive atleast

26.10.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
26.10.23, 18:27 - Niki: Get that the seeing each other soon is kinda like Christmas i get excited but it also makes me realize what i am missing right now
26.10.23, 18:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know if it's getting worse because I know I'll see you soon or because it's been so long since I've seen you but it doesn't feel nice 😅
26.10.23, 18:31 - Niki: Yeah but I feel the same way i dont know what to do on Saturday when i have nothing to distract me from the thought.
26.10.23, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair
26.10.23, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess you just gotta keep yourself busy
26.10.23, 18:35 - Niki: Will find something even though it won't be as good as spending time with you 🥲

26.10.23, 21:47 - Niki: How was it over all
26.10.23, 21:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was good

27.10.23, 07:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Whoops?
27.10.23, 07:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Waking up to these kinds of messages means I either think I'm still dreaming or I wake up really fast because my heart starts beating really fast reading this 🫠
27.10.23, 07:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you too and I really can't wait until Sunday, it's almost painful to still wait that long ❤️🥲. I'm also really curious what you want to try out 🤭
27.10.23, 07:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The only reason I'm not having trouble sleeping is because I am so busy I am too tired to be able to think about much when I get in my bed so I totally understand it but I am blissfully able to sleep anyway 😅
27.10.23, 07:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah
27.10.23, 07:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning my love 😘

27.10.23, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We almost lost track of time so much I looked that my phone and suddenly I realised I had to leave if I wanted to get to class in time 😅
27.10.23, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah no
27.10.23, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The plan was to either study or play Baldur's gate
27.10.23, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So you're right about that
27.10.23, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I got there and well... It's a really fun game to play 😅

27.10.23, 16:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, that's either a very large assignment or you got distracted a lot 😅
27.10.23, 16:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I also have 2 fucking huge assignments I still have to do though, but shhhh)
27.10.23, 16:27 - Niki: They just suck with the thinking part because the text for the questions is weird and its aaaah

27.10.23, 16:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think it's silly, but it does leave me with less to do to distract me 😅
27.10.23, 16:59 - Niki: Yeah its just even the thinks that make me vet a tiny bit clloser too you make me really happy 😅🥰

28.10.23, 13:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I would suggest using a wet towel to take the hair off instead of the piece of plastic they give you with it, it's much easier

29.10.23, 05:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On the way to Brussels
29.10.23, 06:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Waiting for the train to Köln to leave
29.10.23, 07:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And the train is delayed already :)))
29.10.23, 07:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, this train is just stuck in the middle of nowhere in Belgium
29.10.23, 07:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For sure missing all of my following connections
29.10.23, 07:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Imagine you're imagining a train crashing into your stand still train, and then suddenly another train passes by making your train move, man I almost had a heartattack I swear
29.10.23, 07:32 - Niki: Good morning my love ❤️
29.10.23, 07:33 - Niki: Sounds like the definition of what a over thinking person would say. But yeah is a bit scary
29.10.23, 07:33 - Niki: Still thinking your gonna miss the other trains?
29.10.23, 07:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey
29.10.23, 07:34 - Niki: Sorry just woke up 😅
29.10.23, 07:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I had 12 minutes to get my train
29.10.23, 07:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: According to DB there is at least a 57 minutes delay :))
29.10.23, 07:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am definitely missing that
29.10.23, 07:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I think what I'll do instead is go to Frankfurt Hbf with this train (if it ever starts driving again) and then see how to get to you
29.10.23, 07:35 - Niki: Okay rip but you got experience in that field of the db
29.10.23, 07:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sadly enough I do
29.10.23, 07:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't even know why you're awake this early
29.10.23, 07:36 - Niki: Your text only your texts 😅😘 but i am gona sleep a bit more.
29.10.23, 07:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Whoops, sorry for waking you up then 😅

29.10.23, 07:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're waiting for the help locomotive
29.10.23, 07:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why can't this train ride just go well so I can be with you sooner??
29.10.23, 07:48 - Niki: Damm db is really creative with fucking up every train ride
29.10.23, 07:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I gotta say, you definitely do get to experience every single kind of misery they can put you through 😭😂
29.10.23, 07:49 - Niki: Wish you could but db and the universe has something against that
29.10.23, 07:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently so... Goddamn it
29.10.23, 07:49 - Niki: The full experience
29.10.23, 07:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, it's absolutely lovely
29.10.23, 07:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're gonna go to your mom this morning? How's she doing with the covid?

29.10.23, 07:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will you please tell her I hope she gets better soon?
29.10.23, 07:52 - Niki: I will
29.10.23, 07:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks 😊
29.10.23, 07:53 - Niki: By the way the train from Frankfurt to Leipzig will be pact as fuck because 2 of the ones befor and after are canceled
29.10.23, 07:53 - Niki: Its gona be hell
29.10.23, 07:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah shit... Maybe I'll get off in Köln then anyway and see if that's a possibility
29.10.23, 07:54 - Niki: Could try that
29.10.23, 07:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, gonna have to see if I can get to Köln at all at this point 😅🥲
29.10.23, 07:54 - Niki: Well you got the experience 😘
29.10.23, 07:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
29.10.23, 07:55 - Niki: Yeah db is a joke and its insane that we still some what trust it
29.10.23, 07:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There are possibilities
29.10.23, 07:57 - Niki: I hope and pray that you get here some what in a good time for the circumstances.
29.10.23, 07:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We'll see I guess
29.10.23, 07:57 - Niki: How are your neighbors on the train
29.10.23, 07:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't do much other than wait and see at this point
29.10.23, 07:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing special, just a lady minding her business
29.10.23, 07:58 - Niki: Also nice
29.10.23, 07:58 - Niki: Mabye hijack the train or make a pact with the old gods
29.10.23, 07:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have checked the trains again and it is gonna be hell anyway because apparently all the options go through Frankfurt anyway 🥲
29.10.23, 07:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll see about making a pact with the old gods, sounds like fun
29.10.23, 08:01 - Niki: I will a wait your arrival my knight in shining armor. For only you can save me and give me what i want. Please save me 😘
29.10.23, 08:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any chance you'd be willing to pick me up at Erfurt instead? Totally okay if that doesn't work btw, just wondering
29.10.23, 08:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You silly goofy boy, I will try to save you until my last breath 😘
29.10.23, 08:01 - Niki: Yeah sure would totally do
29.10.23, 08:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay cool, then I can work around that depending when we actually leave this damn place we're still stuck in 🥲

29.10.23, 08:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries, I'll keep you up to date on everything that happens 😘
29.10.23, 08:03 - Niki: DB is a fucking nightmare of a company
29.10.23, 08:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It really fucking is
29.10.23, 08:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We are moving 🥳
29.10.23, 08:09 - Niki: Happy to hear that
29.10.23, 08:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will see where we end up now I guess
29.10.23, 08:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay so we all have to get on another train in Liège, I'm gonna take a train to Frankfurt airport and then from there to Erfurt, so hopefully I'll be there at 15, but I'll keep you updated
29.10.23, 08:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have been very very smart
29.10.23, 08:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I booked a reserved seat on the train to Frankfurt
29.10.23, 08:51 - Niki: Okay nice to hear that? How
29.10.23, 08:52 - Niki: Nice good job not standing long times in a train for you today
29.10.23, 08:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactlyyyy
29.10.23, 08:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm still waiting to book a reserved seat for the one from Frankfurt on though, no clue how or when or what will happen, not risking it
29.10.23, 08:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm also getting my money back, Jesus. DB better pay up 💪
29.10.23, 08:53 - Niki: Yeah hope so too🙏🏼
29.10.23, 09:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Getting to my reserved seat will be the difficult part
29.10.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The amount of French I have had to use today is insane
29.10.23, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Makes me appreciate the fact that I can actually speak that a lot more
29.10.23, 09:29 - Niki: The French are everywhere
29.10.23, 09:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They really are, it's crazy
29.10.23, 09:29 - Niki: But nice helping some peoplenis allways good
29.10.23, 09:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also 50% of Belgium speaks French but whatever 😅
29.10.23, 09:30 - Niki: Well yeah but i dont know them 😅
29.10.23, 09:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay fair 😂
29.10.23, 10:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Helping out people trying to book seat reservations for their next train now 😅 DB should hire me or just pay me for customer support
29.10.23, 10:12 - Niki: The hero we need.
29.10.23, 10:59 - Niki: How is it looking good looking?
29.10.23, 11:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Trying to figure out how to get to you the soonest, but pretty alright for now. How are you doing?
29.10.23, 11:03 - Niki: Pretty allright mostly just waiting <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
29.10.23, 11:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
29.10.23, 11:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You went to visit your mom?
29.10.23, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also a question
29.10.23, 11:05 - Niki: On my way there any min now
29.10.23, 11:05 - Niki: Sure
29.10.23, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What would you prefer I do, get off the train at Erfurt at 14:28 or Leipzig at 15:10?
29.10.23, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For me it's the same, just what works better for you honestly
29.10.23, 11:05 - Niki: Leipzig would be better
29.10.23, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 👍
29.10.23, 11:06 - Niki: The time to get home is shorter and i am not that often in Erfurt
29.10.23, 11:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, makes sense, I'll hopefully be there at 15:10 then
29.10.23, 11:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nvm, that's not gonna work either... I fucking hate how these things wor'
29.10.23, 11:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *work
29.10.23, 11:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's like I'm trying to finish a puzzle with the pieces constantly changing 🙃
29.10.23, 11:09 - Niki: Okay just keep me updated
29.10.23, 11:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found 2 different trains
29.10.23, 11:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now it's 15:19
29.10.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries, I'll definitely do that
29.10.23, 11:13 - Niki: By the way the "Car?" really nice
29.10.23, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks 😊
29.10.23, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still adding to it so if you have any suggestions let me know :)))
29.10.23, 11:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There are at least 50 cops at Frankfurt, absolutely insane
29.10.23, 11:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's probably at least 50 more that I didn't see
29.10.23, 11:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So much police in general? There was also a police officer on my train with a gun, there's a lot more security than I'm used to
29.10.23, 11:51 - Niki: Yeah dont know the reason thought
29.10.23, 11:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't know either, but I've seen on a bunch of stations that it said "police action" whatever that means
29.10.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Waiting for my train to Leipzig now
29.10.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hopefully I'll get on there
29.10.23, 11:54 - Niki: Nice hope so too🙏🏼
29.10.23, 12:03 - Niki: You wanna go eat something in Leipzig then when you get there?
29.10.23, 12:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe, idk, probably not unless you want to
29.10.23, 12:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You will never believe this
29.10.23, 12:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I actually got a seat... With ease
29.10.23, 12:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel way too smart right now, not okay 😂
29.10.23, 12:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I decided to take a train to the station before the one that was recommended to me, in hopes of getting before the masses, and I actually succeeded
29.10.23, 12:09 - Niki: Yeah no we can also drive home.
29.10.23, 12:09 - Niki: Your are way to smart hon great things.
29.10.23, 12:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't bump my ego too much 😉
29.10.23, 12:12 - Niki: Thats what i am here for
29.10.23, 12:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're here for much much more than that 😘
29.10.23, 12:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It now looks like I'll be in Leipzig at 15:10
29.10.23, 12:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, the biggest reason why I don't feel like eating something there is very simply because I want to hug and kiss you and I'm not sure doing that in public would be proper
29.10.23, 12:42 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
29.10.23, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean
29.10.23, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Technically I can make something with all of that
29.10.23, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Depends what you want to eat?
29.10.23, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are these from your parents' garden??

05.11.23, 13:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, nah, the only option that would let me get home faster is to take a Eurostar to Paris and I'm not buying another ticket for that, but I'll keep you up to date when I take another train 😘
05.11.23, 13:01 - Niki: Feels empty in my room 🥲
05.11.23, 13:01 - Niki: I thought there was one if it got delayed abit thats going over Brussels?
05.11.23, 13:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently not today, there's some construction works in Essen so all trains to Belgium need to take a detour 😅
05.11.23, 13:02 - Niki: Ah sucks
05.11.23, 13:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, but I finally get why all the other trains went through the Netherlands now
05.11.23, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you still up to today?
05.11.23, 13:08 - Niki: Meeting with my group and un stuff
05.11.23, 13:08 - Niki: *uni
05.11.23, 13:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, good luck with that!
05.11.23, 14:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got to Hanover, now waiting for my train to Dortmund
05.11.23, 14:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's probably gonna be packed to the max so no sitting for this one
05.11.23, 14:25 - Niki: Hope it goes by fast then
05.11.23, 14:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, 1 hour and 39 minutes, will see

05.11.23, 15:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It would not surprise me if I didn't get home tonight the way this is going 😒
05.11.23, 15:48 - Niki: Ahh fuck how is it lookiing ?
05.11.23, 15:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I miss my next train I'll be stuck in Duisburg... Again... I do not want to be stuck there again
05.11.23, 15:49 - Niki: I hope you get it 🙏🏻
05.11.23, 15:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so too 😅
05.11.23, 15:49 - Niki: Else how is the train going
05.11.23, 15:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's alright, found a seating spot. There's some kids playing around and being loud but with my headphones that's all no issues
05.11.23, 15:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your afternoon going?
05.11.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could you do me a small favour please?
05.11.23, 15:52 - Niki: yes
05.11.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't copy the text but I want to make sure it's nothing important, can you tell me what this says please?
05.11.23, 15:52 - Niki: still with the group work
05.11.23, 15:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
05.11.23, 15:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope it's a bit more productive than yesterday and you get a lot of work done 🍀😘
05.11.23, 15:55 - Niki: Its about the trains beetween Essen-Steele and Duisburg because of works they can be droped. Other trains can be moved to a diffrent Track so please watch at the app where the train starts
05.11.23, 15:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, thank you!! 😘❤️
05.11.23, 15:58 - Niki: Man the DB is a shit show of a company
05.11.23, 15:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
05.11.23, 15:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It really is
05.11.23, 15:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The amount of times I have to adjust what train I will take next or what station to go to is insane
05.11.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Someone just lost their kids so now we're standing still until they're found... Fucking bullshit <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
05.11.23, 17:15 - Niki: What the Fucking hell where should it go its a train?
05.11.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know??? Also what parent loses their kids on a train??
05.11.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, they better find those kids soon... I'll be pissed if I miss my train because of this shit
05.11.23, 17:17 - Niki: Stupid parents or just taking a nap gone wrong 😅
05.11.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess so...
05.11.23, 17:17 - Niki: Yup would call them out if that happens
05.11.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably yeah, I'm definitely complaining to db to get my money back because I'm already gonna be home an hour later than I was supposed to
05.11.23, 17:18 - Niki: good idea
05.11.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Missing my train for sure... Fucking bullshit
05.11.23, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Delay of 60 minutes
05.11.23, 17:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna fucking kill someone

05.11.23, 17:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have too much faith in my mental health
05.11.23, 17:35 - Niki: I dont think so your strong 💪🏻
05.11.23, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
05.11.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess they found the kids because we're driving again!
05.11.23, 17:50 - Niki: wait that was the still going
05.11.23, 17:51 - Niki: damm wow
05.11.23, 17:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
05.11.23, 17:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no fucking clue where those kids were hiding but either the parents are abusive or they play hide and seek too much because damn
05.11.23, 18:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently everyone has to go to Aachen... This is gonna be terrible
05.11.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The trains to go to Aachen are fucking weird
05.11.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 4 bicycle compartments and then 2 first class and 2 second class, not nearly enough for all these people
05.11.23, 18:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's a really cute dog though
05.11.23, 18:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Makes it almost worth it
05.11.23, 18:33 - Niki: "Allmost" xD
05.11.23, 18:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well I haven't pet the dog yet so I mean, not yet fully worth it
05.11.23, 18:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I get to pet the dog it just might be
05.11.23, 18:41 - Niki: Good doggie <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
05.11.23, 18:42 - Niki: Sounds really nice
05.11.23, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The dog is yes
05.11.23, 19:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex is 100% falling head over heels in love with this new person they're talking to 😂
05.11.23, 19:24 - Niki: Kinda nice to hear but also worrying but what do i know about that kinda of relationship or hers in perticular. Over all i hope for the best. 
How is it going ? 
Is she already making some photocollage ?
05.11.23, 19:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahaha, no photocollages yet 😂
05.11.23, 19:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I don't want her to get hurt either but Alex is gonna have to figure it out themself I'm afraid 😅
05.11.23, 19:26 - Niki: Well yeah just be there in any case i geuss and mabye look for abit of red flags
05.11.23, 19:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But so far she's ranting to me about how good of conversations they have and apparently the person sent her a video of them cooking in uhum... Not a lot of clothes so Alex basically doesn't really know how to cope at the moment 😂
05.11.23, 19:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll definitely do that, but red flags are kinda hard to find when you don't meet the people, that I do know unfortunately
05.11.23, 19:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex just sent me one of the messages the person sent them and... God fucking damn it
05.11.23, 19:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They got to know each other 3 days ago?? They're talking about sexual fantasies???
05.11.23, 19:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And mf.... I have to say, it's hot
05.11.23, 19:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But also I am reading this shit on a train 😭 someone could read it too????
05.11.23, 19:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kids on the train are fucking annoying
05.11.23, 19:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will stand by that
05.11.23, 19:54 - Niki: Yes they are but oh well they still need to gwt somewhere some how. But thats the rrason for family train segments
05.11.23, 19:54 - Niki: Damm thats fast. Is it then personal smut if you know the people and do you image them doing it or your self with me?
05.11.23, 19:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, but only a few countries have those unfortunately
05.11.23, 19:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay now that is not what I meant but okay
05.11.23, 19:57 - Niki: Wait what did you mean  ? then sorry if i got it wrong
05.11.23, 19:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex sent me what the other person sent, which wasn't a scenario between them, just something they have done (using a remote controlled sex toy on someone else during dinner at a restaurant)
05.11.23, 19:57 - Niki: Yeah its nice but not a must have sadly
05.11.23, 19:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which I think is kinda hot, but also idk if that would be possible 😅
05.11.23, 19:57 - Niki: Damm thats realy nice
05.11.23, 19:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
05.11.23, 19:57 - Niki: I would like to try that out
05.11.23, 19:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So it's not something I would imagine them doing, but it does sound nice
05.11.23, 19:58 - Niki: Yeah get that now
05.11.23, 19:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well damn okay... We'll have to buy one then 🫣
05.11.23, 20:00 - Niki: Well we still have somethings to try out so yeah its gonna be nice 😘
05.11.23, 20:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely
05.11.23, 20:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda sad we didn't get to try out the ropes but we have time for that at some point 😊
05.11.23, 20:01 - Niki: Yeah for sure probaply will bring them with me next time
05.11.23, 20:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds good to me 😊
05.11.23, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Missing my next trainnnn
05.11.23, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, gotta love the fucking railway system
05.11.23, 20:14 - Niki: Fuuuuuck
05.11.23, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now I can wait an hour in Welkenraedt :)))
05.11.23, 20:14 - Niki: Well planning again
05.11.23, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, no planning to do, it's such a small station there is no other option
05.11.23, 20:15 - Niki: Where the fuck is  welkenraedt?
05.11.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Belgium
05.11.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's the closest station to the border of Germany I think
05.11.23, 20:16 - Niki: Well still influenced by the db i see 😅
05.11.23, 20:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Point is, it's a shit station and there's nothing to do for an hour :(
05.11.23, 20:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Clearly so!
05.11.23, 20:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And unfortunately my next train isn't under db anymore so it probably won't be late
05.11.23, 20:18 - Niki: Well you get home at some point today hopefully mabye tomorrow 🥲
05.11.23, 20:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will probably be today, but late
05.11.23, 20:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: See why I think I might have to come and get you from Brussels? 😅😂
05.11.23, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The train waited!!
05.11.23, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't have to wait a fucking hour!n

05.11.23, 22:46 - Niki: Nice hope it made the train ride abit more bareable
05.11.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They really did make it more bearable, didn't have to go looking for food, was great 😊
05.11.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It seems I was a bit too quick in celebrating almost being home
05.11.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty sure my tram just got into an accident with a car
05.11.23, 22:52 - Niki: Interrnal  screeming 🥲🤬

06.11.23, 09:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I went to sleep pretty much when I told you, but waking up still felt like hell 😅 hope you got enough sleep too 😘
06.11.23, 09:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today? Working on the group work again?
06.11.23, 09:16 - Niki: Nope not enough sleep but just woke up 😅
06.11.23, 09:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Take a nap at some point then if you feel like it 😴

06.11.23, 17:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Class was pretty annoying, and I was feeling down all day so I just bought a shitload of chocolate to hopefully make up for it (doubt it though)
But lunch with my grandparents was really nice

06.11.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a good plan! I'm probably gonna call Alex
06.11.23, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And eat a shitload of chocolate
06.11.23, 18:08 - Niki: Nice did she meet up with her tinder date yet?
06.11.23, 18:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, the date is sick right now apparently
06.11.23, 18:11 - Niki: Sad by the way i am gone make a mushroom soup now for dinner. Kinda wanna cook more now because of you 🥰
06.11.23, 18:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooh, nice! I love mushroom soup, hope you enjoy it 😘 You're making it from scratch?? That's so cool!
06.11.23, 18:56 - Niki: Yeah from scratch 😅
06.11.23, 18:57 - Niki: It wasn't in the instructions but i use the handmixer will see if that was right 😅
06.11.23, 18:57 - Niki: Just to short while though
06.11.23, 18:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Handmixer will be just fine, no worries, just mix it for long enough
06.11.23, 18:57 - Niki: Okay
06.11.23, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Send me a picture when it's done please?
06.11.23, 19:04 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
06.11.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Looks pretty good to me! Tastes good too?
06.11.23, 19:05 - Niki: Yeah burnt my tongue though 🥲
06.11.23, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh 🥲 that sucks... Hope you can still enjoy it even with a burnt tongue 🥲
06.11.23, 20:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you have nutmeg in your kitchen?
06.11.23, 20:07 - Niki: nope
06.11.23, 20:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good
06.11.23, 20:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Keep it that way
06.11.23, 20:18 - Niki: scarred i will kill myself with it 😅
06.11.23, 20:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Partially
06.11.23, 20:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex almost did
06.11.23, 20:19 - Niki: damm how isnt that like common Knowledge ?
06.11.23, 20:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex knew about it but the cap fell off the bottle by accident 😅
06.11.23, 20:24 - Niki: And she ate that ? 😅,
06.11.23, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, tried to fix it
06.11.23, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thankfully
06.11.23, 20:25 - Niki: okay
06.11.23, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I knew it could be deadly, but apparently you can also get high which is new news too me
06.11.23, 20:31 - Niki: Well yeah alot of poisons can get you in a "high state". Which makes alot of sense
06.11.23, 20:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, does make a lot of sense
06.11.23, 20:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Your sweater smells like you... So I'm scared to wear it so the smell would leave 😅
06.11.23, 20:35 - Niki: ahhh sooo cute
06.11.23, 20:36 - Niki: Well i wanna it back with your smell so yeah need to wear it at somepoint 😅
06.11.23, 20:36 - Niki: But get that
06.11.23, 20:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair... But I wanna keep the smell as long as I can 😭😅
06.11.23, 23:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening going?
06.11.23, 23:26 - Niki: Played some games, talk with the group and alex / Fabian about driving to Berlin. Now getting ready for bed have a presentation tomorrow <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
06.11.23, 23:28 - Niki: How is your night going hon ❤️? How was the call?
06.11.23, 23:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like you had a nice evening 😊
Good idea going to bed, I'm also getting ready for that now. Good luck with the presentation!!! 🍀🍀🍀

Calling Alex is always interesting, turns out their date's name is also Alex 😂
But yeah, talked about politics and family issues, was nice, I'll go over there tomorrow for DnD so that'll be nice
06.11.23, 23:32 - Niki: Ah nice tomorrow dnd as 4 wow. Your still gone play the character by the way. How is alex doing over all? If she gets together with her i will need to give them numbers or Alex's Alex will be a thing then 😅
06.11.23, 23:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm still playing the character since that was something we worked out before we thought of Jinte joining and it kinda makes sense now within the campaign. Alex isn't doing great, but she'll get through it somehow I'm sure. Plus I'll try my best to help her out of course. 

Yeahhh, maybe it's just easier if you get used to calling my Alex Aaliyah then 😅
06.11.23, 23:35 - Niki: Okay hope she gets through it and i am excited for dnd.
06.11.23, 23:35 - Niki: Love you hon ❤️

How's your day going so far?
07.11.23, 11:00 - Niki: In class looking at the presentation of the others
07.11.23, 11:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still have to do your own presentation?
07.11.23, 11:01 - Niki: Yeah but we are in the second half so like 15 something
07.11.23, 11:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, that's still 2 hours??
07.11.23, 11:24 - Niki: yeah we have a course in betwenn the Präsentation
07.11.23, 11:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooh, okay, interesting, kinda sucks you have to be there for the first part though, unless the presentations are interesting?
07.11.23, 11:33 - Niki: Yeah not it sucks but its mandatory so i need to suck it up 😅
07.11.23, 11:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah.... yeah that sucks, maybe you can do something else during the time or are you really having to pay attention to it?
07.11.23, 11:39 - Niki: No not really but yeah its still nice to know what the other groups do and mabye steal some ideas
07.11.23, 11:39 - Niki: but yeah i most doing other stuff 😅
07.11.23, 11:39 - Niki: How is your plan for today ?
07.11.23, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's true,  you can definitely find some interesting stuff but mostly it just sounds pretty boring 😅
07.11.23, 11:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Gotta take a shower, go to class, go to Alex's and eat dinner there with her and her dad, then play dnd :)
07.11.23, 11:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anything planned other than class and dnd?
07.11.23, 12:23 - Niki: nope nothing else planned
07.11.23, 14:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with the presentation!! 🍀🍀🍀
07.11.23, 14:36 - Niki: Its gonna be later 🥲. They move it back by an hour or so
07.11.23, 14:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What... Hope it's not too boring
07.11.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.11.23, 14:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One of the memes in my law class slides... definitely an interesting prof
07.11.23, 14:56 - Niki: what does it say i cant translate that much
07.11.23, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's more about the picture
07.11.23, 14:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But what it says is "books stay absolutely necessary to properly raise a child"
07.11.23, 15:00 - Niki: Ah yeah i see
07.11.23, 16:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How'd it go?
07.11.23, 17:09 - Niki: Was nice done now so driving back
07.11.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice, drive safe 😘
07.11.23, 20:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The difference between DnD last week and this week is crazy
07.11.23, 20:01 - Niki: yup
07.11.23, 20:01 - Niki: but its fun
07.11.23, 20:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True
07.11.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Handsome mf
07.11.23, 21:48 - Niki: hehe you too
07.11.23, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How did you like DnD today?
07.11.23, 22:56 - Niki: was really nice I like the the combat overall. Only at the ende it kinda got through that you and alex where done and just wanted it to end.
07.11.23, 22:58 - Niki: I also wanna talk more with npc for more then the story
07.11.23, 23:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.11.23, 23:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.11.23, 23:07 - Niki: Yeah but "i wanna do more the just the story". Kinda feels like there iis only the main story to follow
07.11.23, 23:08 - Niki: Also you char is kinda op and makes combat or other rolls stuff kinda to easy or not really useable for the players
07.11.23, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.11.23, 23:14 - Niki: Well, you do not need to set up a side story. Its can just happen like just go with it if it happens. Okay but yeah it just takes some power form us players
07.11.23, 23:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's not a set up that you're necessarily gonna walk into and do you know? It's just ideas of things that could happen. And just letting things happen would work for me if I was the one mainly DMing, but that simply doesn't work for Alex because improv isn't exactly their thing. And like I said, it's not always gonna be like this, there's a reason I'm "showing off" now
07.11.23, 23:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are you upset with me? I don't know if I'm reading wrong things into your messages or not
07.11.23, 23:31 - Niki: No not upset with you or alex just something that i am not sure about if you want them like that
07.11.23, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, okay, yeah no we're pretty okay with how things are going right now, just a little limited in the options where we're at right now, that's all. I can't exactly explain everything we've planned to you to show how we've thought it out either 😅
07.11.23, 23:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (with options I mainly mean for you guys)
07.11.23, 23:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My gut feeling tells me something is wrong but I don't know if I should trust that or not so I will just assume that you'll tell me if something is wrong
07.11.23, 23:49 - Niki: Yeah ii will tell you no worrys
07.11.23, 23:49 - Niki: Why should i not tell you if something doesnt fit me
07.11.23, 23:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean? I always value your opinion so of course I want to know what you have to say
07.11.23, 23:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know, I think maybe I read some subtext that wasn't there so I misinterpreted something that made me worried something was wrong
07.11.23, 23:52 - Niki: i just me i would tell you if something is worng and that allways more then just in subtext
07.11.23, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I know, sorry, I just have to get used to texting again I guess 😅
07.11.23, 23:53 - Niki: Sadly yeah
07.11.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And while texting you may be straightforward, other people are very much not like that so yeah, sorry, I'm just getting worried for nothing
07.11.23, 23:55 - Niki: Yeah but thats also because its you and i can tell you anything
07.11.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
07.11.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But same goes for you
08.11.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you, goodnight hon ❤️
08.11.23, 00:06 - Niki: Goodnight my Love ❤️ Love you too ❤️
08.11.23, 10:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon
08.11.23, 10:38 - Niki: Good morning my love ❤️

08.11.23, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can call I guess but I'm really tired so don't expect much energy
08.11.23, 22:23 - Niki: we dont need to hon
08.11.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then maybe not
08.11.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, nothing bad really happened, just feeling shitty I guess. How was your day?
08.11.23, 22:24 - Niki: Okay then tell me tomorrow and just relax today. Mabye watch some stuff and laay down
08.11.23, 22:24 - Niki: My day was fine had the morging free and went to uni atrr 14 until 18 and the back home now playing game with marco
08.11.23, 22:25 - Niki: Talk with fabian a bit today too and alex
08.11.23, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice
08.11.23, 22:25 - Niki: daily life just going by you know
08.11.23, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I guess
08.11.23, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does it make sense that I want to talk to you but I also really don't have the energy to put effort into that?
08.11.23, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's been like that all day I guess, just didn't have the energy or didn't know what to send you
08.11.23, 22:31 - Niki: yeah get that ❤️ no worries
08.11.23, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess I just waited for you
08.11.23, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun with Marco
08.11.23, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
08.11.23, 22:34 - Niki: thx hon ❤️
08.11.23, 22:34 - Niki: Goodnight hon hope you have a good night ❤️
09.11.23, 08:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon ❤
09.11.23, 08:37 - Niki: Good morning rabbit ❤️
09.11.23, 08:37 - Niki: Hope you have more energy today 😘
09.11.23, 08:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon, but not really 😅🥲
Hope you slept well and you feel better than I do
09.11.23, 08:53 - Niki: Yeah i feel pretty great. Hope i could give you some of my energy 🥰. But you got this hon if somebody can do it then you 😘
09.11.23, 09:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: hmm, I'm happy you feel good today 😊
09.11.23, 09:35 - Niki: By the way do you have any receipt for a chesse mushroom pesto or something i can make with chesse and mushrooms?
09.11.23, 09:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: what kind of cheese?
09.11.23, 09:38 - Niki: Parmesan and cheddar
09.11.23, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: if you bake mushrooms and garlic until most of their moisture is gone (best with a very small amount of oil), let them cool and then add spices and olive oil + grated parmesan you can then blend those and it's kind of like a pesto, but much less spicy I guess? Just don't over blend it, it's quite nice if there's still some small pieces. It's quite good on toast
09.11.23, 09:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can also do it a bit differently and confit the garlic and mushrooms in oil for a week or 2 and then blend them up, but depends on what you want
09.11.23, 09:44 - Niki: will do the first one probably
09.11.23, 09:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thought so yeah, just wanted to give you the option
09.11.23, 09:44 - Niki: Thanks hon ❤️
09.11.23, 09:45 - Niki: Love your knowledge about cooking ❤️
09.11.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No problem ❤
09.11.23, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon 😊
09.11.23, 09:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, when you blend it I would suggest adding the olive oil bit by bit so you can get the consistency you want, you can always add more afterwards but getting it out is really annoying if you have too much 😅
09.11.23, 09:49 - Niki: okay will do it that way  🫡
09.11.23, 09:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck soldier
09.11.23, 13:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going?
09.11.23, 13:27 - Niki: Going alright went shopping with Alex and now doing some uni work. How is your day going? Still going to the chiropractor today?
09.11.23, 13:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with the uni work, gonna go to an extra class maths this afternoon so we'll see. Chiropractor was yesterday and it went fine
09.11.23, 13:58 - Niki: was yesterday ? hm okay still feeliing some neck pain ?

09.11.23, 14:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's because the teacher was I'll yesterday

09.11.23, 14:08 - Niki: sense
09.11.23, 14:09 - Niki: Okay so you will take the 1-2 more sessions ?
09.11.23, 14:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it also hurts less than it did before yesterday so it's kinda nice
09.11.23, 14:09 - Niki: Nice hope it really goes away fully 🙏🏻
09.11.23, 14:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon, hope so too 🙏
09.11.23, 14:14 - Niki: Have fun at math class hon ❤️
09.11.23, 14:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If there is such a thing
09.11.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is not fun, I feel stupid
09.11.23, 14:56 - Niki: You got this hon ❤️ you smart trust me
09.11.23, 14:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No I literally have no clue what to do

09.11.23, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm really annoyed right now. And really jealous. And I really don't want to be either of those things. I'm not telling you not to go or to reconsider, I'm just letting you in on how I'm feeling right now.
09.11.23, 18:59 - Niki: I will reconsider
09.11.23, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I specifically told you not to
09.11.23, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want or need you to solve it. I want you to understand me and how sometimes your actions affect me. That's all
09.11.23, 19:01 - Niki: The brain does what the brain does 😅
09.11.23, 19:02 - Niki: I know that hon its the same form me. But i glady your telling me

09.11.23, 22:38 - Niki: It was really nice but alex was insecure and didn't feel nice so we went home again. I really wanted to stay and dance. I thought over all the vibe was nice but he just sat in a corner. I still tryed to get him to dance and in the mood but yeah didn't work 🥲😓
09.11.23, 22:39 - Niki: The party theme was "ost" Germany and "west" Germany. With a wall in the middle that will go down midnight

12.11.23, 12:21 - Niki: Nope just a hallway
12.11.23, 12:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have a present but I need a way to present it, like a card or something
12.11.23, 12:21 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
12.11.23, 12:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn that sucks...
12.11.23, 12:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is literally the most boring hallway I've ever seen in my life
12.11.23, 12:22 - Niki: Ah okay any ideas allready?
12.11.23, 12:22 - Niki: +1
12.11.23, 12:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, working on canva to see if I like anything
12.11.23, 12:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The present is a jewellry making workshop so I think the theme should be a little bit elegant?
12.11.23, 12:23 - Niki: I am also getting hungry and I am still tired
12.11.23, 12:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No vending machines around to get something from? Might as well try to take a nap while you're waiting if the chairs are comfy 😅🥲
12.11.23, 12:24 - Niki: Yeah still knew that. Vy the way i need to write her a message still ups 😅
12.11.23, 12:24 - Niki: Na just waiting
12.11.23, 12:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, you still have more than 11 hours so you still have time 😘
12.11.23, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope they'll fix up your neighbour's hand soon so you can go home and eat something then
12.11.23, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (and that you'll be back home on time for your meeting) 😅
12.11.23, 12:26 - Niki: Probably not to be honest 😓
12.11.23, 12:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Another rescheduling then I guess?
12.11.23, 12:27 - Niki: Well they can do it without will join later or we move it again 😅
12.11.23, 12:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a hassle 😅

12.11.23, 16:32 - Niki: What you mean?
12.11.23, 16:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just that after delaying it so much now you all really have to get shit done
12.11.23, 16:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least that's how I understand it?
12.11.23, 16:34 - Niki: Well we need to talk about it. But people also get burned out about it fast 😅 so its a on and off but its relax atmosphere still
12.11.23, 16:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I guess I just don't really understand the group dynamics 😅

13.11.23, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh okay, nice, the programming is going well too?
13.11.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, seems like it, they were loading up a car with a hell of a lot of stuff so we're assuming they're moving out. The only thing we don't know is whether or not the house is sold already and if so, who to, but of course we're hoping it isn't so my parents can still buy it 😅
13.11.23, 18:00 - Niki: Didnt start on that so far
13.11.23, 18:00 - Niki: Just ask them go over mabye help ?
13.11.23, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, there's a bunch of them and we don't have a good relationship with them at all + they only speak Bulgarian, so yeah
13.11.23, 18:02 - Niki: ah k sucks well you will see i geuss or find it online mabye ?
13.11.23, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doubt it, this guy only sells privately, not publically, but thanks for the suggestion 😘
13.11.23, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you still up to tonight?
13.11.23, 18:04 - Niki: Watching Loki probably just relaxing and doing some exercise for my courses

13.11.23, 18:07 - Niki: Your plan for tonight me lady ?

14.11.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This infosession is useless my god
14.11.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know all of this info already 😅
14.11.23, 19:08 - Niki: Sucks well atleast they know your face now
14.11.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In an aula with 500 people I don't think so 😅
14.11.23, 19:14 - Niki: well nevermind
14.11.23, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, well, might decide to speedrun German B2 level
14.11.23, 20:25 - Niki: oh okay sound like a challenge ? Tell me more what did they talk about ?
14.11.23, 20:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically that you should already speak German if you go there 😅
14.11.23, 20:29 - Niki: xD well thats one way but yeah german dont speak english
14.11.23, 20:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It appears so, but it's good motivation, especially if I have to follow courses in German my German would improve a lot
14.11.23, 20:34 - Niki: Yeah its a great motivation
14.11.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
14.11.23, 20:59 - Niki: Going back now or party?
14.11.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hanging out with Celine at her dorm, then we'll see what we do I guess, still not sure
14.11.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Party only starts at 22 so there's a lot of time still
14.11.23, 21:07 - Niki: Okay nice did Celine also go too the Erasmus meeting?
14.11.23, 21:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but we both thought it was kinda useless, went to eat pasta afterwards
14.11.23, 21:21 - Niki: So she is also thinking about doing another Erasmus? Nice hope it was good 😘
14.11.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, probably around the Nordics again but there's not that many options this time unfortunately 🥲
14.11.23, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the headache doing btw? Hopefully gone by now?
14.11.23, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also dating apps are fucking hilarious, Celine just showed me her Bumble and I laughed my arse off 😂😂
14.11.23, 21:40 - Niki: Its gone thank god 🙏🏻
14.11.23, 21:41 - Niki: Yeah Its really interesting think its crazy
14.11.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Really funny profiles most of the time, and Celine matching with men is fucking hilarious 😂
14.11.23, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also found out that pets make it 5x more likely to swipe right
14.11.23, 21:58 - Niki: Yeah would have thought so to be honest
14.11.23, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It makes sense but it's really funny how obvious it is
14.11.23, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also crazy how all the guys on the app have the same names
14.11.23, 22:35 - Niki: Really crazy ?
14.11.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's all Wout, Stijn, Seppe, Brecht, etc.
14.11.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Really Dutch names
14.11.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it has happened that three in a row just have the same name
14.11.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No imagination
14.11.23, 22:36 - Niki: Seppe xD thats so shity name
14.11.23, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte's ex is called Seppe 😂
14.11.23, 22:36 - Niki: Oh jesus love the typical dutch names
14.11.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, they're great
14.11.23, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There was also a Klaas but that guy actually had a good profile
14.11.23, 22:38 - Niki: Dutch is for a German one of the funniest languages ever.
14.11.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Made a word pun with his name because cheese is kaas, so he said to have a cheese (Klaas) and wine evening
14.11.23, 22:38 - Niki: Klaas is a nice name to be honest
14.11.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same thing goes the other was around
14.11.23, 22:38 - Niki: Yeah thought so
14.11.23, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sincerely disagree, that's the most Netherlands Dutch name ever and just no... You'd get bullied for that in Belgium
14.11.23, 22:41 - Niki: Well i think klaas is a nice name
14.11.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
14.11.23, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Everyone has the right to their own opinion
14.11.23, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: As long as you know we'll never call a kid Klaas
14.11.23, 22:42 - Niki: I know no worries
14.11.23, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not gonna go to the party 🥳
14.11.23, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with the meeting 😘
14.11.23, 23:15 - Niki: It looks like they wanna move it i love and hate the group its a roller-coaster.
14.11.23, 23:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh man... I would hate it 100% but at least you don't have a meeting now 😅
14.11.23, 23:24 - Niki: We are meeting right now nevermind
14.11.23, 23:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah shit 🥲
14.11.23, 23:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I were religious I would pray for you
14.11.23, 23:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record, this (for once) isn't because I'm a social recluse, Celine has a headache and I don't want to go alone with Arne

Love you too my lovely silly goose ❤️😘
15.11.23, 21:08 - Niki: Man i wanna be there right now sooo badly. Just saying you got this 🥰❤️
15.11.23, 21:09 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
15.11.23, 21:12 - Niki: I am sending this but first of alll its really quit.
Secondly i hate my oen voice recorded. Thirdly i mumble way to much. Lastly i dislike saying it because i wanna be there and tell it to you.
Just a small rant about me voice memos and distance.
15.11.23, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you so much, thank you for the voice message, currently trying not to cry because you're so sweet and I really can't fucking wait until December. The best motivation I could have is that I need to be able to keep some free time for you, so I will try my hardest to make that possible. I just don't want to fail anyone, especially my parents 🥲 (and you) 
You are truly so lovely it's hard to believe you're real sometimes ❤️
15.11.23, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I also really hate my own voice recorded so I never listen to them after I send them 😅)
15.11.23, 21:19 - Niki: No worrys about failing me hon ❤️. I believe with my whole heart that you cant fuck it up and you got this 🥰. Love you in every universe there is 😘
15.11.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you in every multiverse ;) ❤️🥰

15.11.23, 21:33 - Niki: ah nice
15.11.23, 21:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's like the universe is telling me something about Germany
15.11.23, 21:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk what exactly but you know, if the universe tells you something, you try to listen 😂
15.11.23, 21:35 - Niki: Well I am also feeling that universe wants to give me sign towards Belgium
15.11.23, 21:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
15.11.23, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️

16.11.23, 10:21 - Niki: Ah well waiting and hope you dont get sick there 🙏🏼. Why are you at the hospital by the way did i forgot something again?
16.11.23, 10:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know if I told you, but I definitely forgot to put it in the calendar. It's just an appointment to check my eyesight and see if I need new glasses
16.11.23, 10:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Long overdue 😅
16.11.23, 10:29 - Niki: Oh i don't think you told me then. Hope it goes by fast and you get done with it.

16.11.23, 10:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (drive safe)
16.11.23, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good news, my eyes are as shitty as ever, but that also means they haven't gotten worse since 2019 :))
16.11.23, 11:40 - Niki: lets gooo
16.11.23, 11:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which is honestly incredible now I think about it
16.11.23, 11:41 - Niki: One of the people in my group got eye surgery so they dont need glass anymore. You though about eye surgery
16.11.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, I've thought about it but you have to be 21 so I haven't really thought about it seriously yet
16.11.23, 11:42 - Niki: In my opinion i dont get why you should do surgery for it just take the glasses. Well if it fets really bad then mabye but i dont know
16.11.23, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but if you want to do sports or anything like that I guess it is easier, but I don't really think I'll do it anyway
16.11.23, 11:43 - Niki: Also hers went not so well so she needs to go to alot of check ups. Can  not meet eith us for 3 weeks thats really shitty. Should have taken like a week
16.11.23, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The idea of the surgery sounds scary 😅
16.11.23, 11:43 - Niki: Yeah true didnt think about that part
16.11.23, 11:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn that really sucks... Hope it will be fixed soon 🥲
16.11.23, 11:44 - Niki: Yeah but she said its really easy in comparison to others
16.11.23, 11:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, having never been in surgery I'd like to keep it that way as long as possible 😅
16.11.23, 15:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going hon?

19.11.23, 10:47 - Niki: Nightmare about what?
19.11.23, 10:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was stuck in a tunnel under ground after being chased by my Australian cousins and I basically choked to death 🥲
19.11.23, 10:48 - Niki: Damm wtf
19.11.23, 10:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
19.11.23, 10:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a hard time falling back asleep after that because I really felt like I was choking, it was creepy as fuck
19.11.23, 10:49 - Niki: That's like real nightmare shit crazy 😳. Hope you feel okay now
19.11.23, 10:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'm okay now 😅

19.11.23, 12:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah that works
19.11.23, 12:22 - Niki: null
19.11.23, 14:02 - Niki: Hon how are you doing? I feel weird
19.11.23, 14:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm okay? What do you mean you feel weird?
19.11.23, 14:06 - Niki: I don't know head feeling heavy its weird just alot to think about i geuss.
19.11.23, 14:07 - Niki: Mostly the think with us not seeing each other after new years
19.11.23, 14:07 - Niki: Or no plan lets say it that way
19.11.23, 14:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh honey, it's okay, we'll figure out a way. It's still a month and a half before new year's so we still have time to figure something out 😘
19.11.23, 14:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Worst case scenario is that we don't see each other for 2-3 months, but I don't think it will be that long, we'll figure something out
19.11.23, 14:10 - Niki: Yeah your right but minds not listening to it
19.11.23, 14:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I get that
19.11.23, 14:10 - Niki: 2-3 and i will die
19.11.23, 14:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sometimes my head feels so heavy I just can't do anything but sit there and wait until it leaves
19.11.23, 14:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know hon, but that's the worst case scenario okay? We'll figure something out in between 😘
19.11.23, 14:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And while I don't want to give false hope, there's a chance I might be a lot closer to you from September/oktober on 😅
I know that's still a while but it's definitely better than nothing
19.11.23, 14:16 - Niki: Geuss will do that
19.11.23, 14:17 - Niki: Will see. At simepoint will need to talk about the future and what we gonna plan i think
19.11.23, 14:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay now I'm also feeling like this 🥲
19.11.23, 14:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, for sure. It would be nice to have an end date in mind
19.11.23, 14:18 - Niki: Sorry but the text kinda help still heavy head though🥲
19.11.23, 14:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not your fault at all, the texts do help a bit yeah
19.11.23, 14:19 - Niki: There needs to be one 🙏🏼
19.11.23, 14:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There really does
19.11.23, 14:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just to have something to look forward to in the end
19.11.23, 14:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When we no longer need to plan around our calendars to see when we both have free time 🥲
19.11.23, 14:22 - Niki: Cant wait for that
19.11.23, 14:22 - Niki: also try to get my head free with some games mabye that helps
19.11.23, 14:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope it helps 😘
19.11.23, 14:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't wait for that either
19.11.23, 16:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You feeling a bit better hon? ❤️
19.11.23, 16:09 - Niki: Yeah kinda just laying in bed right now tough
19.11.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, get that, doing the same right now 😅
19.11.23, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Moustache is keeping me company though, which is nice
19.11.23, 16:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
19.11.23, 16:10 - Niki: Good kitten
19.11.23, 16:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes
19.11.23, 16:13 - Niki: I should do some university stuff now
19.11.23, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same
19.11.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh btw, I forgot to tell you but remember when I said Alex met someone on Tinder? Apparently it's no longer going that well because Alex is getting bored with the other person 😅
19.11.23, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And Celine is going on a date with a guy she met on Bumble on Thursday :)
19.11.23, 19:20 - Niki: Oh damm really why happened? Just inaktiv?
19.11.23, 19:21 - Niki: Oh nice hope they hit it off and he is nice
19.11.23, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I just think they're both not really putting effort in, Alex told me they keep just having the same conversations about how their day went, but really boringly? Idk how to describe it. Probably could be fixed if they called though I guess
19.11.23, 19:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, the guy said he's a good cook but then his first proposal was chicken and rice (Celine is allergic to chicken 😅) so I'm curious to hear how that will have gone
19.11.23, 19:23 - Niki: Yeah probably
19.11.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and Jinte is also coming over for New Year's, but Alex isn't
19.11.23, 19:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I have once again earned my title of Tabasco theory expert
19.11.23, 19:24 - Niki: Yeah the alex wont come you told me already
19.11.23, 19:24 - Niki: Huh?
19.11.23, 19:24 - Niki: Story behind that please 🥺
19.11.23, 19:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, sorry, I forgot about that 😅
19.11.23, 19:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically I had to do a bunch of research on tabasco during my internship so I know way too much about their history and regional products. Now Cato has to do an assignment on the USP of tabasco so here I am giving them basically all the info they need 😅
19.11.23, 19:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Started when Cato asked what I associate with Tabasco and I said tornadoes
19.11.23, 19:46 - Niki: Its crazy how some knowledge is useable some times
19.11.23, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely true, would have never expected that
19.11.23, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤️
19.11.23, 23:17 - Niki: Goodnight rabbit ❤️ 😘🐇
19.11.23, 23:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
20.11.23, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't sleep
20.11.23, 00:34 - Niki: Anything on your mind
20.11.23, 00:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, don't want to choke again I guess
20.11.23, 00:34 - Niki: Ah i see
20.11.23, 00:35 - Niki: Well no real help there
20.11.23, 00:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't expect that, but thanks 😘
20.11.23, 00:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Talking to you is comforting
20.11.23, 00:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I miss you a lot too, doesn't help the sleeping part
20.11.23, 00:38 - Niki: Just wanna paint you a picture. Its abit windy and rainy outside but also really quit. You can nearly only hear then wind and some raining outside. The windows is open and its nicely fresh outside. The leafs are still out side but also falling every where. You can hear some cars driving by but you also get more tired every time you can here one until you fall asleep
20.11.23, 00:39 - Niki: Yup get that 100% especially when its like perfect cuddle weather and i would like to do nothing else in the world right now
20.11.23, 00:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The only thing that would make this image better would be if it included us cuddling
20.11.23, 00:40 - Niki: Man i write like shit too much outside
20.11.23, 00:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, 100% same
20.11.23, 00:41 - Niki: Yes ♾️% better
20.11.23, 00:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, we're at this point in our relationship where I can read and understand your messages without even noticing the mistakes or things like that
20.11.23, 00:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't worry about it 😘
20.11.23, 00:42 - Niki: Thanks hon but more of a self reflect on my shitty "poetry" skills
20.11.23, 00:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, I liked it
20.11.23, 00:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's really sweet, and the image itself is something I find really soothing, so you were spot on with that too
20.11.23, 00:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're a cutie
20.11.23, 00:43 - Niki: You're a cutie too ❤️
20.11.23, 00:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And if you ever want to decide to try out poetry, then I will gladly listen to anything you have to say ❤️
20.11.23, 00:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But that's just a thing in general, doesn't only have to be poetry, I like listening to you
20.11.23, 00:44 - Niki: You would be the first to hear it
20.11.23, 00:45 - Niki: Same back to you
20.11.23, 00:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm so in love with you it's insane to think about sometimes
20.11.23, 00:46 - Niki: Get what you mean like all other scenarios are irrelevant thanks to you and i allways think about you anyways
20.11.23, 00:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, like that
20.11.23, 00:48 - Niki: Being a adult now and tell you to go sleep now please 🥺
20.11.23, 00:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll try
20.11.23, 00:49 - Niki: Hope it works and cant wait to cuddle us again till we sleep together in each others arms 😘
20.11.23, 00:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But just to point out, I'm an adult too and I can make my own decisions 🙃
20.11.23, 00:50 - Niki: Yes obviously hon ❤️
20.11.23, 00:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't wait for that either 😘
20.11.23, 00:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's the point in trying to act like a brat when your response just makes me melt anyway
20.11.23, 00:51 - Niki: Your a big girl now and can do what you want.
20.11.23, 00:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you my silly lovely goose 🥰❤️
20.11.23, 00:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I can do you?

20.11.23, 13:21 - Niki: Ah okay sucks but well geuss you need to use the mouse then. I am pretty sure its some hardware problem like a lose connection or something pressing on it  from below.
20.11.23, 13:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably yeah, sucks a lot though, thankfully I'm taking a mouse with me everywhere now
20.11.23, 13:32 - Niki: Allready excepting the failure. Smart girl
20.11.23, 13:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon
20.11.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going my love? 😘

20.11.23, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Statistics, it's a practical class so you need to go through the theory by yourself first
20.11.23, 17:31 - Niki: Ah okay well hope you get it done soon and can relax abit tonight
20.11.23, 17:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh… we'll see, I really want to go to sleep early tonight, I feel deadtired 😅😴

20.11.23, 20:10 - Niki: Huh whats going on in the landen down under ?
20.11.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing really happening right now, but I found a Tumblr blog that only talks about the batshit insane things that happen in Australian politics and I'm just laughing my ass off reading through it
20.11.23, 20:12 - Niki: Huh some examples of the post?

20.11.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
20.11.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And there's so many more 😂
20.11.23, 20:16 - Niki: What else are you up to?

20.11.23, 20:26 - Niki: Sorry if i am destroying you relax time with thr question not my intention to demoralize you 😓

20.11.23, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's uni going for you?
20.11.23, 20:27 - Niki: Allright nearly done with it
20.11.23, 20:27 - Niki: Ah okay felt kinda bad after just asking you like you should work
20.11.23, 20:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice
20.11.23, 20:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What did you have for dinner?
20.11.23, 20:39 - Niki: Nothing yet

20.11.23, 21:04 - Niki: Yes i did no worrys
20.11.23, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Toppie
20.11.23, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wait no
20.11.23, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That was my Dutch brain
20.11.23, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *That's good!
20.11.23, 21:06 - Niki: Toppie is now in my language
20.11.23, 21:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Change of plans, not doing shit for school today 😅
20.11.23, 21:09 - Niki: ? What happened
20.11.23, 21:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently Cato's grandma just died so they're coming over
20.11.23, 21:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cato needs some comforting
20.11.23, 21:11 - Niki: Oh damm hope you can help her
20.11.23, 21:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll definitely try
20.11.23, 21:15 - Niki: She is gonna sleep at your place too. How is she overall?
20.11.23, 21:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know, Cato isn't here yet
20.11.23, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know anything other than what was written in the message, which was just asking to come over because they need a hug
20.11.23, 23:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cato was okayish, just mainly wanted to think about something else for a bit. Not staying over, which is good, couldn't prepare for my class but obviously Cato took priority on that
20.11.23, 23:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Want to go to sleep now
20.11.23, 23:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: However

21.11.23, 13:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't go wrong with sandwiches
21.11.23, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have already given up paying attention to this class 😅
21.11.23, 13:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Prof just keeps asking if he's insulting our intelligence and honestly yes he is
21.11.23, 13:28 - Niki: Damm Prof is ruthless or the people in the front sre lying
21.11.23, 13:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No one is actually answering him
21.11.23, 13:29 - Niki: Wasn't law a nice course what happend that you gave up?
21.11.23, 13:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He's just confusing people about a relatively simple topic
21.11.23, 13:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah yeah no, I still like the course, it's just a different prof for this class and I don't like him, he's boring
21.11.23, 13:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And slow
21.11.23, 13:29 - Niki: Yeah well you get to be a prof not a teacher
21.11.23, 13:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which should do the same though
21.11.23, 13:30 - Niki: Yeah get that
21.11.23, 13:30 - Niki: This part
21.11.23, 13:30 - Niki: Yeah but they didnt learn how to teach stuff
21.11.23, 13:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They should though, that should be mandatory, at least some classes for it
21.11.23, 13:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to for the rest of the day?
21.11.23, 13:37 - Niki: Probably uni stuff and watching some series
21.11.23, 13:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice
21.11.23, 13:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's Loki?
21.11.23, 13:45 - Niki: Season 2 still first episode

21.11.23, 13:53 - Niki: Yeah its pretty good
21.11.23, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice
21.11.23, 14:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Prof just asked if anyone would like the class to be taught faster (mind you there's 500 people in this class) and I was the only one to put my hand up... And the guys said he'd teach faster.... 😂😅
21.11.23, 14:13 - Niki: xD the prof values your opinion more than anything else
21.11.23, 14:13 - Niki: Or he is just happy he got feedback
21.11.23, 14:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably the second 😅
21.11.23, 14:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm tired
21.11.23, 14:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I want hugs
21.11.23, 14:36 - Niki: Would love to give you wanna

21.11.23, 21:26 - Niki: Damm Looks crazy covid is back ?
21.11.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think that's what the artist was aiming for but I see your interpretation
21.11.23, 21:28 - Niki: Yeah jk what do you think about the art ?
21.11.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hard to say
21.11.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The light looks really nice in the street
21.11.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And considering 10 years ago in the same place instead of the lights there was ham... A lot better than back then for sure
21.11.23, 21:30 - Niki: yeah for sure but red light 😳
21.11.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh honey
21.11.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's a lot more red lights 3 streets from that 😂
21.11.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also the building it is on is a university campus 😂
21.11.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And irl it is more orange I think
21.11.23, 21:39 - Niki: ah okay you still at uni at this time hon your overworking yourself
21.11.23, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not, I'm home
21.11.23, 21:41 - Niki: hehe
21.11.23, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was with Alex to study and just drove past there on my way back
21.11.23, 21:42 - Niki: Oh okay nice how was the study what did you do ?
21.11.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mostly tried to help Alex get her study credits back honestly, took an hour to do research and send an email for that
21.11.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then did some law
21.11.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
21.11.23, 21:44 - Niki: Ah okay any what do you think will she get it or how is it looking with her studys
21.11.23, 21:44 - Niki: So Adorable ❤️
21.11.23, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Studies not looking overly great, but we'll see after the exams
21.11.23, 21:44 - Niki: ah okay Mabye make a plan b already it can help came the nervs
21.11.23, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The credits... Idk, she's asking back credits from 2021-2022 so I'm sure they will still want to do that 😅
21.11.23, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't think that's a great idea, because that decreases the self confidence she has right now I think
21.11.23, 21:45 - Niki: okay nevermind
21.11.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I think Alex already has like a million plan b's 😅
21.11.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing much I could add there
21.11.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry, I didn't mean to just throw away your suggestion like that. It's a good suggestion, just maybe not for Alex at this point
21.11.23, 21:48 - Niki: Yeah no worrys i know you meant it that way
21.11.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay good 😊

21.11.23, 23:56 - Niki: I would love to be there and if its only to help you sleep well

22.11.23, 11:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would have to go to a different campus for that and I refuse to you outside
22.11.23, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sadly, good luck with that then 😘
22.11.23, 12:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ich habe gerade ein Übersetzertool auf meinem Telefon gefunden, das direkt übersetzt, wenn ich tippe ... Können Sie mir bitte sagen, wie genau das ist? Ich möchte mit einigen Leuten ficken :)))
22.11.23, 12:14 - Niki: You want to fuck some people? Its really weird to read. it's definitely translate you can see that. And you don't need to be so formel with me 😅
22.11.23, 12:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahaha
22.11.23, 12:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay no, that's terrible
22.11.23, 12:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I said I want to fuck with some people, mess with them is maybe better?

22.11.23, 22:31 - Niki: Hope I dream of you too
22.11.23, 23:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm going to the funeral on Saturday. This whole thing is kind of weird, I met her only a bunch of times and I barely remember anything about her honestly. But now she's gone she really made me realise that there are some people that I wouldn't know what to do without and well... Most of them have been around for a really long time. Or at least 5 years or something. And then I think about you and my heart just fucking breaks trying to think about it. Crazy how in less than a year someone can mean so much that the thought of no longer having them would make your life seem just... Bad.
22.11.23, 23:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also yes I am once again not able to sleep and overthinking 😅
22.11.23, 23:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I feel like I'm oversharing maybe
22.11.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or ruining your evening
22.11.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Shit
22.11.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry
22.11.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah man
22.11.23, 23:39 - Niki: No worrys hon ❤️ you cant over share with me
22.11.23, 23:39 - Niki: And i get that feeling and
22.11.23, 23:49 - Niki: The feeling with losing people i mostly get with my parents and grandparents because it will happen soomer most likely but i dont wanna think about it because i already i will ball my eyes out
22.11.23, 23:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
22.11.23, 23:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Get that
22.11.23, 23:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did cry just now though, but that can have a bunch of reasons
22.11.23, 23:51 - Niki: Well you didnt know them that well so yeah get that
22.11.23, 23:51 - Niki: More worried about the other people
22.11.23, 23:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't cry for them
22.11.23, 23:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I cried out of fear, exhaustion, stress, pain and I guess just a bit of heartache
22.11.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But the show must go on
22.11.23, 23:55 - Niki: Sadly the world doesn't wait for anybody. So yeah
22.11.23, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very comforting
22.11.23, 23:56 - Niki: Yup sorry 😅
22.11.23, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pftt

Een schaap met witte voetjes

Sterretjes aan de hemel staan

23.11.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're kidding, what?? We should go to sleep? Can't believe that

23.11.23, 12:26 - Niki: How is your day going hon ❤️ ?
23.11.23, 12:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you find some food then hon, you better eat good 😘

Sounds like an interesting project, hope it goes well! Any specific reason you're suddenly switching to Linux? I mean yes Windows works shitty sometimes but more specific than that?
23.11.23, 12:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My day is alright, in my last class now and then just going home. Period is shitty/bloody but I'm feeling a bit better than yesterday
23.11.23, 12:35 - Niki: Mostly because i am only programming on it so way shouldnt I it makes sense. And the starting Problem was because of a docker update with windows subsystem ... and some more stuff. Hope you can relax at home and mabye use some heating on your stomach or back to help with the period a bit. Love you rabbit 😘🐇
23.11.23, 12:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay yeah that makes sense I guess! I had heard before Linux was better for programming but I didn't realise it made that big of a difference. Yeah, gonna take a shower, put on some comfy clothes and try to study a bit.
23.11.23, 12:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too my silly goose ❤️🥰
23.11.23, 12:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.11.23, 12:38 - Niki: It doesn't make a big difference just easier to keep it running. If you run into a problem you can easily set it up again
23.11.23, 12:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh okay, thanks for explaining, it's interesting to know 😊
23.11.23, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, do you maybe want to watch a movie tonight? I feel like there's too many movies on our list

My day is okay, got home just in time for the rain, other than that it was boring I guess. Just relaxing now
How has your day been my love? ❤️
24.11.23, 17:06 - Niki: Nice doing the same now with some games and a cold Spezi. My day was alot of time management driving and meeting with people. Was nice not gone lie but alot of social interaction 😅.
24.11.23, 17:07 - Niki: Oh yeah and it snowed kinda
24.11.23, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds tiring but pretty interesting! Would take time management, meeting people and driving around over boring classes most days 😅
24.11.23, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy the relaxing hon, you deserve it 😘
24.11.23, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am jealous 🥲, so very jealous
24.11.23, 17:14 - Niki: It looks really nice driving around. Still love as i were a child
24.11.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's supposed to snow in the higher part of Belgium this weekend too, but only very little, I hope it snows here soon, but I doubt it 🥲
24.11.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can definitely believe that. God knows I love snow way too much still
24.11.23, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would drive a couple of hours to see it this winter for sure
24.11.23, 17:16 - Niki: Does it snow in gent at all anytime of the year?
24.11.23, 17:16 - Niki: Its really really nice
24.11.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Usually it does snow a bit but it doesn't stay long at all. If we're lucky it stays for a couple of days though, but it's definitely not a lot of snow 🥲
24.11.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: More likely to get snow in January and February though
24.11.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It used to when I was a lot younger though
24.11.23, 17:17 - Niki: Crazy maybe we will see it together
24.11.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope so
24.11.23, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would love for it to snow when you're here
24.11.23, 17:18 - Niki: Now i am imagining small manon playing in the snow. Really fucking cutie
24.11.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My grandpa might have some pictures, idk, but yeah, I can imagine small Niki playing in the snow too, really fucking adorable 🥰

24.11.23, 17:22 - Niki: Same hon ❤️ same
24.11.23, 18:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The more I have periods, the more I am convinced the bible is right and it's a punishment from god because Eve ate the fucking apple.
24.11.23, 18:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: However I'm a devout atheist so I absolutely do not believe the bible whatsoever
24.11.23, 18:36 - Niki: "The more I have periods, the more I am convinced the bible is right and it's a punishment from god because Eve ate the fucking apple." is a quote just saying
24.11.23, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah... that's fair, I'll write it down
24.11.23, 18:36 - Niki: Damm hon ❤️ i am sorry hope i could be there too support you and cuddle
24.11.23, 18:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no... My issue right now is not the pain or the blood, it's... well... different.
24.11.23, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let's put it this way, that very fine line would very quickly be shredded to pieces and left far behind
24.11.23, 18:38 - Niki: Ah okay you too horny i sse

25.11.23, 02:46 - Niki: I miss you hon ❤️
25.11.23, 02:47 - Niki: It's so crazy how one person can change my mood so much even though i think about them every day. I just love you like crazy
25.11.23, 02:47 - Niki: Wanna hug you badly
25.11.23, 08:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Even though the thought of you laying awake pains me, it's quite nice waking up to a message of you telling me you love me 😘 instantly brightens my day 😊
25.11.23, 08:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you too, so so much, I really can't wait until you're here. I'm literally already thinking of what I should cook and how to schedule the days you're here so I can make the most out of them with you.

I wish I could hug you and kiss you awake in the mornings and kiss you goodnight in the evenings ❤️

I love you my silly goose, so much ❤️😘

25.11.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I'm happy I went for Cato and their family
25.11.23, 11:31 - Niki: Sounds nice doing anything after church? Or just the funeral?
25.11.23, 11:32 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

25.11.23, 11:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A vague plan
25.11.23, 11:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But a nice one
25.11.23, 11:58 - Niki: Allways a bit vague
25.11.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fuck around and find out?
25.11.23, 11:58 - Niki: You got it hon ❤️
25.11.23, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds lovely

25.11.23, 12:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
25.11.23, 16:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://open.spotify.com/track/29uCsFSUSVktiMUZdzqpiD?si=mlDUAiY6RPGm6o0v7r14PQ
25.11.23, 16:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This song in a car... Bad idea
25.11.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day been going so far?
25.11.23, 18:09 - Niki: Allright just laying in bed wishing you were here 🥲. Also played some games and called with alex
25.11.23, 18:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know, Alex sent me a reel on Instagram yesterday to ask about it, it was a techno club I think, and ever since I have only been getting ads on Instagram for clubs
25.11.23, 18:23 - Niki: Tek is a interesting music choice or is it more edmb
25.11.23, 18:23 - Niki: EDM
25.11.23, 18:24 - Niki: But clubbing is allways nice bit dancing why not
25.11.23, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Depends I guess. Most clubs have a different genre for different days
25.11.23, 18:24 - Niki: True
25.11.23, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But techno and house are pretty popular
25.11.23, 18:24 - Niki: Yeah i dont like techno alot and house is meh
25.11.23, 18:25 - Niki: I like more a 2000/90 mix <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
25.11.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Respectfully disagree, but then again I'm biased because 2 of the best techno DJ's in the world right now (again biased but okay, at least I know it's biased) are Belgian women 😁
25.11.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhhh... I don't think I've ever heard of this
25.11.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mox?
25.11.23, 18:27 - Niki: Mix
25.11.23, 18:27 - Niki: Sorry 😅
25.11.23, 18:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, so 00's and 90's music?
25.11.23, 18:27 - Niki: Yeah i meam there are always good songs
25.11.23, 18:27 - Niki: Yes
25.11.23, 18:27 - Niki: Or early 2010
25.11.23, 18:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course that's good too! Depends on the kind of evening you want but those kinds of songs are more fun to dance to yeah 😊
25.11.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, but it's more the way their set is built up for me. I don't know how many original songs they use when they perform honestly
25.11.23, 18:44 - Niki: Wanna become a techno dj by any chance?
25.11.23, 18:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No thanks, I know too many DJ's at this point to even consider it
25.11.23, 18:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fellow student DJs for the record
25.11.23, 18:50 - Niki: Yeah i thought so
25.11.23, 18:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hey you never know, Alex knows a world famous DJ
25.11.23, 18:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or well.... Knew? The guy had a thing for her mom so once she rejected him that connection kinda disappeared 😅
25.11.23, 18:51 - Niki: Yeah i also know that but thats somebody alex know or did you meat them ?
25.11.23, 18:51 - Niki: okay nevermind
25.11.23, 18:53 - Niki: what are you up too hon ❤️
25.11.23, 18:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going to dinner with my parents and grandpa, Greek apparently. We're gonna talk about the menu for new year's. What are you up to?
25.11.23, 18:54 - Niki: Just laying in bed watching loki
25.11.23, 18:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the second season?
25.11.23, 18:55 - Niki: pretty good just dont like the Charakter desgin from some of the cast anymore
25.11.23, 18:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I've heard that's some of the main criticism people have about it too
25.11.23, 19:03 - Niki: https://open.spotify.com/track/29uCsFSUSVktiMUZdzqpiD?si=mlDUAiY6RPGm6o0v7r14PQ
25.11.23, 19:03 - Niki: ts a good song
25.11.23, 19:04 - Niki: but yeah in a car mh better listen to Tupac
25.11.23, 20:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question
25.11.23, 20:09 - Niki: ┘
25.11.23, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The main dish would be a fish, but really well prepared in a cover of salt. Do you want me to look for an alternative so you can have something else to eat? It's no bother to me if you want me to look for it at all
25.11.23, 20:10 - Niki: Nah its fine
25.11.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You sure?
25.11.23, 20:11 - Niki: yup
25.11.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay then... Will make sure there are a bunch of vegetarian starters so you can have something good to eat in case you don't like it though
25.11.23, 20:12 - Niki: Okay Thanks hon ❤️ love how thoughtful you are
25.11.23, 20:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just want to make sure you can enjoy the food too, even when it's a mix between veggie and fish dishes 😘
25.11.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just got home, how's your evening going?
25.11.23, 22:24 - Niki: Done with loki and now making dinner 😅
25.11.23, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Better late than never I guess 😅
25.11.23, 22:26 - Niki: Yeah 😅
25.11.23, 22:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you like the ending of the second season?
25.11.23, 22:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And what are you gonna eat?

25.11.23, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair, I get that too at times
25.11.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Something being random makes it all the more nice sometimes 😘
25.11.23, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, but really I love it when I randomly get messages from you, no matter what it's about, but ones like this make my heart skip a beat 🥰
25.11.23, 22:55 - Niki: Ah cutie ❤️ but yeah same

26.11.23, 11:33 - Niki: She come over yesterday and sad that she didn't get the feeling of love with him but still wanted to be with him because he is nice. Didn't love him but thought it would cole with time 😶
26.11.23, 11:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahh... That fucking sucks... So he said that if she didn't feel the same way he did then it was over? They haven't been together for that long though
26.11.23, 11:41 - Niki: No she said she wants to break up because of her feelings. So yeah 🥲 but he is coming over and we will hang out a bit
26.11.23, 11:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah shit... I hope Fabian will be okay, that has to hurt 🥲

27.11.23, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well
27.11.23, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite frankly
27.11.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Having a kitchen will be nice, but it's not exactly the main thing I'm looking forward to
27.11.23, 20:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You didn't get what I mean did ya?

27.11.23, 20:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okayyy, I see what your priorities are, but you're right, sleep is important
27.11.23, 20:55 - Niki: Yeah and cuddling is too😘 mabye we can combine the two 🤭
27.11.23, 20:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, acceptable

27.11.23, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We'll see once we get there, I would absolutely understand it if you just wanted to eat something and get to bed, train travel is exhausting 😅

27.11.23, 21:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh hon, I wish I could be with you. Man, if I was only 30 or something minutes away I'd fucking get in the car right now :'(
27.11.23, 21:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to tonight?
27.11.23, 21:20 - Niki: Same hon ❤️
27.11.23, 21:20 - Niki: Just some university stuff
27.11.23, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same, I have to do peer reviews 😒 and they're not anonymous...
27.11.23, 21:22 - Niki: No idea what that is but sounds shity
27.11.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's basically just giving your teammates feedback, but obligatory and they know who gave them what grades, which sucks
27.11.23, 21:23 - Niki: wtf that sucks
27.11.23, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, there's 1 guy I want to give bad grades to because well... his text isn't good and he's quite fucking annoying to work with, but I also don't want him to lash out on me because of it... Especially because we still have half of the project to go :(
27.11.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record though, I don't want to give him fail grades, just not great ones
27.11.23, 21:34 - Niki: Yeah no worries hon i get what you feeling have a similar person in my group but thankfully I don't need to grade them
27.11.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Lucky you, ended up giving most of them an okay grade after all, and Celine and outstanding one of course 😅
27.11.23, 21:57 - Niki: Good idea ☺️
27.11.23, 23:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight and sweet dreams my love ❤️
27.11.23, 23:00 - Niki: Goodnight hon ❤️

28.11.23, 10:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's probably for the best, I don't have the money to go there 😂
28.11.23, 11:29 - Niki: But it would be nice. Still trying?
28.11.23, 11:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really, there's way too many people in line

28.11.23, 18:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah
28.11.23, 18:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes :(
28.11.23, 18:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would have to get there first though
28.11.23, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I think I would be a little too preoccupied to care about the snow immediately
28.11.23, 18:06 - Niki: Yeah 🥲
28.11.23, 19:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Absolute cutie
28.11.23, 19:45 - Niki: you too ❤️

28.11.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, anytime to tell me other than Thursday is a good time. Yeah, we can move it no problem. Just can't do Friday
28.11.23, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But once again
28.11.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ????
28.11.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just no response
28.11.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also not to this
28.11.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do I really have to ask you to say it back?
28.11.23, 22:50 - Niki: Love you too sorry was taking a shit
28.11.23, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's a very interesting explanation for not reading all the messages. Didn't know shitting and reading were impossible at the same time. You're a curious person hon
28.11.23, 22:52 - Niki: Sorry hon but i just didn't see it
28.11.23, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no, I was just laughing with the fact that you tried to reason that you didn't read it because you were taking a shit, which is quite frankly the funniest reason I've ever had someone not read a message
28.11.23, 22:56 - Niki: Okay text kinda got the mad feeling
28.11.23, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry hon, didn't mean it that way, was doing Duolingo
28.11.23, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay I realise this kinda looks like I'm mocking you but I really wasn't
28.11.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just can't use emojis very well from the notification bar 😅🥲
28.11.23, 23:06 - Niki: Yeah happens to me mostly though 😅. Its nice to be the one who wasn't miss understud
28.11.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
28.11.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, miscommunications are there to be figured out I guess 😅
28.11.23, 23:07 - Niki: But over all i can say
28.11.23, 23:07 - Niki: ...
28.11.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
28.11.23, 23:07 - Niki: I love you too hon ❤️🤭
28.11.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're a goofball
28.11.23, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't imagine not being with you
28.11.23, 23:13 - Niki: Makes my heart melted but same i totally get it at the same time and feel so too❤️🥺
28.11.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Glad we're on the same page 😘
28.11.23, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
28.11.23, 23:16 - Niki: Goodnight my clumsy but very cuddly rabbit 😘🐇
29.11.23, 07:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon 😘 hope you slept well
29.11.23, 08:08 - Niki: Good morning baby 😘. Yeah okayish how was you night?
29.11.23, 08:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was okay I guess, woke up a bunch of times again, but that happens practically every night now 🥲
29.11.23, 08:29 - Niki: Sucks tough
29.11.23, 08:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I'll live
29.11.23, 08:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to today?
29.11.23, 08:30 - Niki: Classes and preparation for the next few days because it will get kinda stressful tomorrow and Friday
29.11.23, 08:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What happens on Friday maybe?
29.11.23, 08:51 - Niki: We got a university extra course with a company in another city and a party in the evening
29.11.23, 08:51 - Niki: More like a concert
29.11.23, 09:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds interesting
29.11.23, 09:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, when this weekend do you want to call then?
29.11.23, 09:55 - Niki: Saturday or Sunday? Have time on both of them
29.11.23, 09:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should be same, but with my parents I can never be sure
29.11.23, 10:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's probably one of the only things I look forward to in not living at home anymore, the ability to plan things in without them having other things planned I had absolutely no idea about
29.11.23, 10:01 - Niki: Get that but it also gets you out sometimes
29.11.23, 10:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, true
29.11.23, 10:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I've been trying to call Aeneas for over 2 weeks now and because of this I still haven't
29.11.23, 10:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I'm just a little bit frustrated with it now 😅
29.11.23, 10:03 - Niki: Yeah understandable mabye this weekend works 😅
29.11.23, 10:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe
29.11.23, 10:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also absolutely no offence to Aeneas but if I had only 1 person I could call this weekend then I would call you
29.11.23, 10:05 - Niki: Cutie but same
29.11.23, 10:36 - Niki: Did you see the delete messages in the morrrron Klubb
29.11.23, 10:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't see what he said but yeah
29.11.23, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do wonder what it was about, because usually when he does this he has some deep thoughts
29.11.23, 11:06 - Niki: yeah also it was multiple
29.11.23, 11:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly
29.11.23, 11:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda makes me worry
29.11.23, 11:16 - Niki: Mabye he also was half a sleep and didnt look at the chat he wrote in
29.11.23, 11:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doubt it
29.11.23, 11:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But maybe
29.11.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well
29.11.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess that was not for the wrong chat then
29.11.23, 15:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I forgot how much I actually like using public transport
29.11.23, 15:07 - Niki: Yeah db does that to you 🤣
29.11.23, 15:08 - Niki: Nah what up how you come to this
29.11.23, 15:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah true, but I also just don't use it that often because I do everything by car or bicycle now
29.11.23, 15:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going to the chiropractor, normally I drive there but my parents are using both cars so I can't, which means I'm taking a bus 😊
29.11.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does it take 3x as long to get there? Yes, yes it does, but it's kinda nice to just sit down and watch people without worrying about much
29.11.23, 15:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's strangely relaxing
29.11.23, 15:10 - Niki: Yeah totally get that but most of the time you  just dont have the time for it.
29.11.23, 15:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very true
29.11.23, 15:10 - Niki: But yeah relaxing and form time to time really nice
29.11.23, 15:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
29.11.23, 15:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also watching couples on public transport is kinda cute
29.11.23, 15:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would absolutely not like this if I wasn't in a relationship myself though 😂
29.11.23, 15:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But the elderly couple who got on a few stops back just take care of each other in such a mindful way it's lovely to see
29.11.23, 15:12 - Niki: Yeah get that too couples are cute but only if you are in one
29.11.23, 15:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
29.11.23, 15:12 - Niki: Yeah thats just cute
29.11.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, the lovely moment when you're at the appointment before your doctor is
29.11.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He might not even be working today, who knows?
29.11.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, how's your day going my darling?
29.11.23, 16:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, how's your day going my darling?
29.11.23, 16:24 - Niki: Sorry had classes still in one right now will typ to you later
29.11.23, 16:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, sorry, take your time 😘😅
29.11.23, 16:59 - Niki: So hon ❤️ my day was allright and my class is nearly over. But i needing to eat food asap now really hungry. How was your day?
29.11.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you get to eat some good food soon then, didn't eat lunch?
29.11.23, 17:19 - Niki: Nope sadly didnt
29.11.23, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Day was okay, just had to wait outside in the cold for 45 minutes 😅
29.11.23, 17:23 - Niki: Huh why the chiropractor appointment?
29.11.23, 17:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
29.11.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guy apparently doesn't work today
29.11.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I didn't get that notice
29.11.23, 17:25 - Niki: Huh so it didn't happen or a other chiropractor took you over?
29.11.23, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't happen, he's the only chiropractor in the building, which is why I had to wait outside for so long until my mom could pick me up 😅
29.11.23, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Spotify wrapped is also out
29.11.23, 17:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very interesting
29.11.23, 17:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

29.11.23, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, it's okay, I'm just cold to the bone now but I'll live after a good shower
29.11.23, 17:30 - Niki: Huh how did that happen 😳

29.11.23, 18:08 - Niki: By the way there is a location to your music in Spotify you know where it is?
29.11.23, 18:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, mine is Leuven for some reason, which I don't agree with at all
29.11.23, 18:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Where's yours?
29.11.23, 18:10 - Niki: Yeah my is Mannheim 😅
29.11.23, 18:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have absolutely no clue what the locations mean
29.11.23, 18:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You like Mannheim though?
29.11.23, 18:12 - Niki: Nah never been there. But storys i heared its pretty nice
29.11.23, 18:12 - Niki: No idea either
29.11.23, 18:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've heard of it as well, mostly to do with raves if I'm not mistaken? Or at least a music festival, I don't remember exactly
29.11.23, 18:13 - Niki: mh okay nice sounds not bad
29.11.23, 18:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, I'm asking about Mannheim 😅
29.11.23, 18:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Leuven in Belgium is mostly known for the university 😅
29.11.23, 18:15 - Niki: Yeah the storys i know. Where about the city and the Architektur
29.11.23, 18:15 - Niki: And i know nothing much else
29.11.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, okay, sounds interesting
29.11.23, 18:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe we should go there sometime :) it's surprisingly in the middle of us
29.11.23, 18:16 - Niki: Yeah sounds like a good idea
29.11.23, 18:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte found out that apparently she can stalk someone's last hour of listens on Spotify... So now she's stalking the guy who was engaged who she had a one week thing with...
29.11.23, 18:26 - Niki: Oh yeah thats a think. Also jintes exes are a think too man how i forgot something so big so fast 😅
29.11.23, 18:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't fucking know man, she goes big or home, that's just it I guess
29.11.23, 18:28 - Niki: Yeah normal is not a think she does 😅
29.11.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, it's definitely not
29.11.23, 19:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can I spare 10 minutes of your time for a call tonight? Get it if you're too busy, just want to see your face and hear your voice to get to the weekend without going insane
29.11.23, 19:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I may be exaggerating a little bit)

29.11.23, 20:22 - Niki: That i know
29.11.23, 20:22 - Niki: Except when we're alone🤭
29.11.23, 20:23 - Niki: Also the duality of the 2 messages befor. First saying i deserve it and then apologize 😶. Women 😶😶

29.11.23, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just send these to you because I feel comfortable enough with it, but I would never expect you to do the same when you don't feel comfortable
29.11.23, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then send me something else, make it something you feel comfy with, doesn't have to be a photo, video or voice message you know, honestly doesn't have to be anything special. Just remind me that you love me sometimes and I'm happy ❤️

30.11.23, 17:38 - Niki: Man i have no idea hoe one can study this shit. No offense
30.11.23, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hey, I had a prof today who lost his voice, said the class wasn't gonna be long because he would focus on "the essentials" and then still went over time. On only 17 slides... So yeah, high speed if they manage to get 3 people to do their thing in just an hour
30.11.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No offence taken, sometimes I wonder myself
30.11.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: btw?

30.11.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aha

30.11.23, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least one of them is high on cocaine right now
30.11.23, 17:41 - Niki: Okay nevermind dont know enough about them 😅
30.11.23, 17:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If there's one thing I've learnt in the 3 years I've been doing this, in business circles a lot of people do drugs
30.11.23, 17:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course I learned more than just that but it's an interesting tidbit
30.11.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (but most of it is just common sense)
30.11.23, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope the rest of the presentation wasn't that awfully boring
30.11.23, 21:28 - Niki: Yeah was actually pretty nice over all. Had some group experience and some short ted talks

30.11.23, 21:49 - Niki: wanna cuddle you badly 🥺
30.11.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Too many things going through my mind rn
30.11.23, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know why you always seem to think I'm telling you to fuck off when I feel bad. I don't want that
30.11.23, 22:09 - Niki: i am not thinking that .I just dont wanna distract you
30.11.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then you're still assuming what I want, aren't you?
30.11.23, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Without knowing what's going on how can you assume what I would want?
30.11.23, 22:13 - Niki: No i think you wanna text with me so you can distract yourself form your assignment.
30.11.23, 22:13 - Niki: Sorry if thats rude to no text then
30.11.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And there you go assuming again that the only thing I'm thinking about right now is that fucking assignment that I could finish in 15 minutes
30.11.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If anything you are not a fucking distraction to me
30.11.23, 22:14 - Niki: Okay sorry hon 🥺
30.11.23, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I think I can manage my work well enough without other people deciding for me thank you
30.11.23, 22:15 - Niki: i am sorry about deciding it for you
30.11.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's okay, I'm just pretty damn frustrated and you acting like I can't handle myself is not helping with that when I'm already crying about something similar
30.11.23, 22:17 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
30.11.23, 22:17 - Niki: Mabye a cat picture helps.
30.11.23, 22:17 - Niki: huh what happend please tell me more ?

30.11.23, 22:18 - Niki: if you wanna talk about it
30.11.23, 22:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you only would have asked me how my day went earlier

30.11.23, 22:19 - Niki: Yeah actually wanted to do that when i got home but a lot of thinks came in beetween
30.11.23, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had to cook, so I needed water but my dad put something in a fucking annoying place so I almost dropped it. My mom got mad at me, I asked if she doesn't think I'm trying and she basically just said that I'm not, so I lashed out
30.11.23, 22:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, done talking, I feel like I have fucking privileged problems and I'm being a little bitch about it
30.11.23, 22:22 - Niki: Yes but its also both you acted up so yeah
30.11.23, 22:22 - Niki: Did you talk with your mom since then

I know it's not an excuse, but I just miss you a lot and it's sometimes easier to get frustrated with my feelings than to really feel them through. I love you hon, I just have a lot to work on 😅❤️

01.12.23, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean with work flow? Like organisational wise within a company or individual?
01.12.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm fine with cold outside, but the uni campus apparently doesn't do heating and I had to sit still for 3 hours so my feet are frozen
01.12.23, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's up next today?
01.12.23, 17:03 - Niki: Company but more the working groups it's hard to explain over text

02.12.23, 16:36 - Niki: How is your day going hon? What are you up too?
02.12.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At the store to buy drinks now
02.12.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tonight we're having dinner with family and the resident Greek guy who apparently is getting my dad a giant fire bowl he can use to cook today 😅
02.12.23, 16:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How is your day going? 😘
02.12.23, 16:46 - Niki: Nice sounds kinda spontaneously but really nice. What else did you today?
02.12.23, 16:47 - Niki: To be honest nothing much. Just layed in bed and start watching "the crow". On the side some university stuff but nothing big. Also on my way to going shopping 😅
02.12.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently it's not that spontaneous, it's been planned for a while but I once again didn't know about it until today 😅
02.12.23, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We just got all of our kitchen stuff from the garage to put it back. Oh, and we fought against flour moth larvae when we had to throw away some tea and herbs, I fucking hate the creatures
02.12.23, 17:21 - Niki: Sucks but crazy how oftem that happens. Was it alot to throw away?
02.12.23, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, quite a lot, a whole garbage bag
02.12.23, 17:35 - Niki: By the way how is coming to the party tonight?
02.12.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really a party, it's just my parents, aunt and Pieter and the Greek guy
02.12.23, 17:40 - Niki: Anything else planned for tonight?
02.12.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Taking a shower but that's about it
02.12.23, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You?
02.12.23, 17:54 - Niki: The crow mostly and i also bought i ashity rubix cube to solve
02.12.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, what's the crow about?
02.12.23, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with the Rubix cube 😘🍀
02.12.23, 18:07 - Niki: It's about the English monarchy from 1920 or so on. Its really good writen so far and the actors great too
02.12.23, 19:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah! Pieter's mom really likes that show! I don't think she realises it's a bit more dramatic than actual events though 😅
02.12.23, 19:58 - Niki: It is like crazy more dramatic how can she not realize that
02.12.23, 19:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think she kind of uses the show as a means to escape life
02.12.23, 19:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So that's probably why
02.12.23, 20:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or she takes some parts of it and then thinks the wrong parts are fake?
02.12.23, 20:01 - Niki: Yeah well somepeople also dont care about it
02.12.23, 20:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair
02.12.23, 20:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The "based on real events" does confuse a lot of people
02.12.23, 20:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any progress on the Rubix cube?
02.12.23, 20:03 - Niki: Yeah but thats just a phrase i think for most of the time.
02.12.23, 20:03 - Niki: Nope didn't touch it much
02.12.23, 20:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah it is, but when you don't know that it's well... Weird
02.12.23, 20:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So what are the most shocking things that have happened on the crown so far?
02.12.23, 20:54 - Niki: the King died
02.12.23, 20:54 - Niki: the queen is taking over and it really interesting
02.12.23, 20:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which queen?
02.12.23, 20:55 - Niki: Queen elisabeth
02.12.23, 20:56 - Niki: the one that died 1 year ago i think
02.12.23, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah!
02.12.23, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I wasn't sure if it was Elizabeth or Victoria
02.12.23, 20:57 - Niki: Yeah its more "recent"
02.12.23, 20:57 - Niki: How is the "party" going?
02.12.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The Greek didn't stay and we ordered food in and now we're just talking a bit
02.12.23, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's nice
02.12.23, 21:00 - Niki: So you dint make a big fire and grilled something ?
02.12.23, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, my dad was supposed to go to the store for stuff to grill but didn't do it
02.12.23, 21:01 - Niki: Ah okay well hope its still good food then
02.12.23, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And it was a bit too dark to try that now
02.12.23, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it was very good food 😊
02.12.23, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What did you/are you having for dinner?
02.12.23, 21:02 - Niki: Made pizza for my self
02.12.23, 21:04 - Niki: Good pizza
02.12.23, 21:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Noice
02.12.23, 21:05 - Niki: How is the company of your family? Bored?
02.12.23, 21:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, it's okay, we're just talking about what we'd do if we would win the lottery, but I know all the answers they will give already 😅
02.12.23, 21:09 - Niki: And what would you do with a lottery win?
02.12.23, 21:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Depends how much I win
02.12.23, 21:10 - Niki: 3 million?
02.12.23, 21:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, buy a house, maybe 2, a regular car (maybe a Volvo or something) and invest 25%
02.12.23, 21:11 - Niki: Okay sounds smart
02.12.23, 21:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and go on a really nice trip. Probably buy really good presents for my family that year too
02.12.23, 21:12 - Niki: Yeah dont forget the family 😅
02.12.23, 21:16 - Niki: I also love the Conversations in "the Crow".
02.12.23, 21:17 - Niki: Just like she wants to give the kids the last name of the king. She just says "I am a woman" thats the reason xD <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
02.12.23, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
02.12.23, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What would you do?

02.12.23, 23:40 - Niki: Yeah i need to finish it at the ende
02.12.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I couldn't do it myself
02.12.23, 23:41 - Niki: How was your night?
02.12.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was good, but didn't really feel like talking much so I didn't really
02.12.23, 23:42 - Niki: Yeah it sometimes fuck with your mind and its also really good if you can remind the last 3 thinks you turned if you fuck up sometimes
02.12.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cuddled up to my mom for a while until she pushed me away because my feet were too cold 🥲
02.12.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That sounds really nice honestly
02.12.23, 23:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I don't have the patience needed 😅
02.12.23, 23:43 - Niki: Poor you 🥲. I would cuddle with you even with cold feet😘
02.12.23, 23:43 - Niki: I wish we could cuddle right now🥲

02.12.23, 23:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Me too
02.12.23, 23:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What I wouldn't give to be able to just turn around and kiss you 🥲
02.12.23, 23:45 - Niki: Yeah same just laying in bed with you would be so nice 😳
02.12.23, 23:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really wish
02.12.23, 23:47 - Niki: I also bought some vitamin D pills for myself
02.12.23, 23:47 - Niki: By the way ^
02.12.23, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's a great idea!
02.12.23, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope it helps a bit
02.12.23, 23:47 - Niki: Yeah you were the inspiration
02.12.23, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In that case my mom was the inspiration 😂
02.12.23, 23:48 - Niki: Hope so too. Did you take yours today
02.12.23, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, they help me not be as tired during the day so I take them first thing in the morning
02.12.23, 23:48 - Niki: She may not like to cuddle with yu when you have cold feet but she cares about your vitamin in take 😅
02.12.23, 23:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That she definitely does 😂 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
02.12.23, 23:49 - Niki: Hope they do the same for me 🙏🏼
02.12.23, 23:50 - Niki: Also while i was watching the crow so many questions about the life of the monarch. Like marrying into it sounds fuck exhausting and you just live in a shadow then. its weird
02.12.23, 23:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh... Also the fact that Elizabeth's grandmother's sisters were also all married off to an emperor and that the Danish and British monarchy are still distant family makes it all so weird to me 😅
02.12.23, 23:51 - Niki: Also marriage is so holy for them. Like if you break it off your the worst 😅
02.12.23, 23:51 - Niki: All of them are its kinda creepy 😶
02.12.23, 23:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean yeah, kinda makes sense when you're supposed to be the people leading by example for your people. At least that taboo has been pretty much broken nowadays but it's still weird
02.12.23, 23:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
02.12.23, 23:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also how obsessed people get about the royal family is creepy as hell 😅
02.12.23, 23:53 - Niki: Yeah and the reporters are ruthless 😥
02.12.23, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
02.12.23, 23:54 - Niki: Also i had a nightmare yesterday where a spider crawled into my body and pop up out of my penis and killed me. Really fucking weird
02.12.23, 23:54 - Niki: Made me wake up really fast
02.12.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What the fuck
02.12.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That sounds absolutely horrifying
02.12.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely understand that that would wake you up fast 😅
02.12.23, 23:56 - Niki: It was creepy as fuck
02.12.23, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely sounds like it 😅 I'm glad I've never had a dream like that before
02.12.23, 23:57 - Niki: Well mabye tonight 😘
02.12.23, 23:57 - Niki: By the way your sleep schedule is still fucked
02.12.23, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why are you so mean
02.12.23, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And rude
02.12.23, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The fuck do you mean my sleep schedule is fucked?
03.12.23, 00:00 - Niki: Hehe just enjoying being mean to you sometimes 😅 hehe
03.12.23, 00:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why 🥺
03.12.23, 00:00 - Niki: Well sleeping at 2 is in my eyes kinda fucked
03.12.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At 2??
03.12.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't go to sleep at 2??
03.12.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was 1 the latest
03.12.23, 00:01 - Niki: Sorry hon 🥺 didn't want to make you cry
03.12.23, 00:02 - Niki: Sorry didn't wanted to insult you just ask if its bad/fucked
03.12.23, 00:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You didn't
03.12.23, 00:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just confused why you think I went to sleep at 2?
03.12.23, 00:02 - Niki: Because I went to sleep at 2 😅
03.12.23, 00:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfftt
03.12.23, 00:03 - Niki: Yeah it is fucked
03.12.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And then you tell me my sleep schedule is fucked?
03.12.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😂
03.12.23, 00:03 - Niki: I can read your mind
03.12.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah yeah
03.12.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Except
03.12.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My sleep schedule really isn't that fucked
03.12.23, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I woke up at 8
03.12.23, 00:04 - Niki: Dammmmm
03.12.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a good 7 hours of sleep
03.12.23, 00:04 - Niki: Shorty is on a run 🥳
03.12.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh btw, the tv we have now is diagonally longer but almost the same length as my dad
03.12.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And horizontally almost the same length as me
03.12.23, 00:04 - Niki: What really
03.12.23, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
03.12.23, 00:05 - Niki: Okay nevermind it look smaller in the picture
03.12.23, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A bit longer actually
03.12.23, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know it does, but it's because it's on a pretty big wall
03.12.23, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The shorty comment made me think of it suddenly
03.12.23, 00:05 - Niki: Well your short(gremlin laugh hehehe) but your dad 😱
03.12.23, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pffftt
03.12.23, 00:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pieter made a joke we can finally see what my mom would look like at 170cm
03.12.23, 00:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can put a picture of her on the tv and see it sideways 😂
03.12.23, 00:07 - Niki: Damm thats cruel poor Veronic
03.12.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahah
03.12.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, she was laughing along
03.12.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries, we make worse jokes
03.12.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, question
03.12.23, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Your family, do they make a lot of sexual jokes or absolutely not?
03.12.23, 00:07 - Niki: Hope she doesn't get the other elfs and gangs up on pieter
03.12.23, 00:08 - Niki: Non
03.12.23, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man sells Christmas trees, if anyone has enslaved elves it would be him
03.12.23, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh dear, better be prepared for a lot of them at new year's then 😅
03.12.23, 00:08 - Niki: Like very rarely but then they are sneaky ones
03.12.23, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah nah... We do obvious ones 😅
03.12.23, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Especially since the only person who's still underage will be Casper who is 17 now so no one gives a fuck anymore. Not that they ever did in the first place but anyway
03.12.23, 00:10 - Niki: Yeah allready noticed that but till now i think they were holding back abit with me there
03.12.23, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just think you didn't realise them because they were in Dutch honestly
03.12.23, 00:11 - Niki: Oh yeah right i forgot about your cousins. They are also coming
03.12.23, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yupp
03.12.23, 00:11 - Niki: Yeah could also be 😅
03.12.23, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, I'm warning you now because we're organising a quiz and... Welll... We have some spicy questions

03.12.23, 00:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh no no no
03.12.23, 00:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just in general
03.12.23, 00:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like emojis, condom sales, shit like that
03.12.23, 00:13 - Niki: In General 🫡
03.12.23, 00:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing personen
03.12.23, 00:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *personal
03.12.23, 00:13 - Niki: Okay
03.12.23, 00:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We like joking but we'd never force anyone to talk about personal stuff
03.12.23, 00:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And we wouldn't normally joke about personal stuff either
03.12.23, 00:14 - Niki: Yeah would be weird if you did not gonna lie
03.12.23, 00:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No shit
03.12.23, 00:14 - Niki: Normally?
03.12.23, 00:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would think it's fucking rude
03.12.23, 00:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, if we know the person is fine with it and it's generally known it happens sometimes
03.12.23, 00:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But very rarely

03.12.23, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, every first Sunday of the month you can go shopping in Ghent. And in December that's actually all Sundays. Oh, and public transport to get to the city is also free then 😊

03.12.23, 00:19 - Niki: Or belgium if it every where like this
03.12.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm guessing that's the literal translation from German?
03.12.23, 00:19 - Niki: Like in Germany you dont have anything like this at all. Like we have rukes and everybody needs to pay and Sunday is a rest day
03.12.23, 00:20 - Niki: Yeah but i think it should be the same as the English one
03.12.23, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, used to be like that here too until a couple of years back, not sure why exactly they did this, but shops and voluntarily choose to open on Sundays now

03.12.23, 01:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And now I keep thinking about it
03.12.23, 01:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And the 2nd of December was when we baked those cookies together

03.12.23, 01:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And god I miss Norway and the shit we got up to there so fucking much
03.12.23, 01:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The late night meet ups in my dorm, playing pool at the Club, playing cardgames, deciding on movies, having people cook and cooking for people in my dorm, the snow, getting to know you without realising entirely how deep I would fall eventually. The trip we took, just sitting next to each other listening and silently singing along to the music. Me trying to look at you without being too obvious so I could add all the songs you would sing along to to the playlist I was making. Just so I could later on listen to it and think about you (well that was my plan before we actually got together), so many memories I'm so so thankful for
03.12.23, 01:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But most of all I'm thankful you're not just one of those things, you're not just a memory. I'm eternally grateful for that.
03.12.23, 10:20 - Niki: Love waking up and reading all this. I love you hon ❤️. Just reading this sent me down memory lane. It was a amazing time and i will never forget but its the same for me the most amazing thing out of all the stuff that happened in Norway are you ❤️. Just the though of us not happening kinda breaks my heart. I am just so thankful and excited for the future and everything that happend so far. If i could go back i would do it the same way. Love the text, love the time in Norway and most of all I love you ❤️
03.12.23, 11:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too ❤️
03.12.23, 11:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon 😘
03.12.23, 11:00 - Niki: Good morning my love 😘

03.12.23, 17:57 - Niki: Well what do you need to know about the world and its also okay if you dont do one. I will just tell you some back story along the way
03.12.23, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just some things like are there different classes in the society? Is magic normal, feared or glorified? The geography, like is it a world like ours or are there more cities, less nature, mostly water, under water cities, space travel? The political system maybe if there is one
03.12.23, 18:04 - Niki: Social Classens yes and it work based on the Magic power you have or Familie has.
03.12.23, 18:07 - Niki: Magic is prevalent and celebrated. Its also highgly respected and integrated into various aspects of daily life. While some magic is feared.
03.12.23, 18:09 - Niki: Eldoria is situated in a vast and varied landscape. All around the city are enchanted forests/lakes and magical creatuers and special landmarks. No bigger waters around
03.12.23, 18:12 - Niki: The  Political system is a council typ. The council is made up of representatives from different magical disciplines and is led by a High Arcanist chosen from among the most esteemed members.

03.12.23, 20:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, my mom hates it now and with the all yellow walls I do agree it was a bit much 😅
03.12.23, 20:16 - Niki: Yeah the Vibe was diffrent but still not everything was bad. For example there were a lot of diffrent styles back then

04.12.23, 10:02 - Niki: Whats your plans for today?
04.12.23, 10:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Class of course, apparently I'm calling my cousins during my lunch break and I will have to finish my background story for DnD at some point too
04.12.23, 13:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Calling my cousins was weird as fuck
04.12.23, 13:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
04.12.23, 13:29 - Niki: Huh really what happend ?
04.12.23, 13:29 - Niki: ^
04.12.23, 13:30 - Niki: Going allright on dc with marco now and doing dnd on the side
04.12.23, 13:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just felt weird, didn't talk to them in a year or something. They didn't change that much, I still know how they act and all that, but yeah, it's weird how they act like nothing is wrong. They also said they might want to come to Europe and asked when I will go to Australia to visit them and all that 😅
04.12.23, 13:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cool
04.12.23, 13:40 - Niki: Sounds weird as fuck and a bit awkward but still nice that you talk with them. Your parents know by the way that you called them? And any plans to fly down 😅?
04.12.23, 13:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, felt like that. 
They don't, we only talked about it this morning in class so it was really spontaneous. 

Absolutely no plans to fly down anytime soon, if not just for the money, also because it would be awkward as fuck
04.12.23, 13:49 - Niki: Yeah thought so
04.12.23, 16:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You got my backstory I hope?
04.12.23, 16:23 - Niki: Yes
04.12.23, 16:24 - Niki: Just working on the puzzles and riddles nearly done for tomorrow
04.12.23, 16:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cool, sounds like it will be an interesting session
04.12.23, 16:25 - Niki: Hope so
04.12.23, 16:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have anything planned to do tonight?
04.12.23, 16:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm sure it will be
04.12.23, 16:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If we find the puzzles of course

04.12.23, 16:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't even think about doing that thing you do where you don't answer because you don't want to distract me
04.12.23, 16:47 - Niki: Would never think about that 😅
04.12.23, 16:48 - Niki: Sounds like a good idea but your brain eill most like be fried by the end of math
04.12.23, 16:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well

04.12.23, 17:54 - Niki: Yeah i also sturggle with them a bit but i think it will work?
04.12.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can only try right?
04.12.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We'll all just try to make it work
04.12.23, 17:55 - Niki: Yeah will see 😅
04.12.23, 17:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah

05.12.23, 11:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So far they think it probably was a heartattack or something similar
05.12.23, 11:29 - Niki: Ah okay so no murder running around oh your campus
05.12.23, 11:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Shouldn't be yeah
05.12.23, 11:48 - Niki: How is your day going other than mabye having a killer on campus?
05.12.23, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty alright, my stomach is a bit upset but statistics was fun
05.12.23, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We're curious if our professor Law will say anything about the situation because we have class on that campus this afternoon 😅
05.12.23, 11:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
05.12.23, 11:56 - Niki: Allright back home now need to find some food. And a bit more work on dnd and uni stuff

05.12.23, 12:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice, good luck with that!
05.12.23, 12:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My class this afternoon is cancelled
05.12.23, 12:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know I said that we heard it wasn't a suspicious death, but why the fuck would they close off a whole university building for a whole day if it wasn't somewhat suspicious?
05.12.23, 12:51 - Niki: Just in case allways the case
05.12.23, 16:38 - Niki: How is your day going hon 🥰?

05.12.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Right now?
05.12.23, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, well, if you remember anything because if I remember correctly, someone was getting distracted the whole time 😘
05.12.23, 22:17 - Niki: Yeah we were planning befor but weren't sure but yeah
05.12.23, 22:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cool, have fun then, you'll definitely have to tell me about it!
05.12.23, 22:18 - Niki: Yeah some thinks ❤️ but also thinking about you while thinking back 😅
05.12.23, 22:18 - Niki: The howl think will remind me of you constantly 🥲
05.12.23, 22:18 - Niki: Miss you 🥲❤️
05.12.23, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you too hon, I'm counting down the goddamn hours 😅 it's definitely not going fast enough 🥲❤️
05.12.23, 22:23 - Niki: Well mabye we are not going 😅
05.12.23, 22:23 - Niki: Alex is tired and i wouldn't go alone
05.12.23, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough I guess
05.12.23, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is quite late already, you guys have class tomorrow?
05.12.23, 22:24 - Niki: Yeah definitely
05.12.23, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You definitely have classes tomorrow?
05.12.23, 22:27 - Niki: Yeah and also doing some uni stuff
05.12.23, 22:28 - Niki: Also need to find some stuff for the business
05.12.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah okay
05.12.23, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What things do you need to find?
05.12.23, 22:36 - Niki: Need to find some parts and some place to put the stuff
05.12.23, 22:36 - Niki: In our underground storage
05.12.23, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck finding that then
05.12.23, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex wants to join DnD next time?
05.12.23, 22:46 - Niki: Yeah will see about that i kinda want him but not sure if his English fin or not and also his intentions
05.12.23, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It would be good to improve his English, I asked Jinte and Alex what they think. What do you think about his intentions though?
05.12.23, 23:00 - Niki: Tell you later
05.12.23, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
05.12.23, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will keep you to that because you've just awakened massive curiosity in me
05.12.23, 23:20 - Niki: Yeah sorry but its nothing big
05.12.23, 23:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you realise that my curiosity is never about anything big specifically, just about things that people tell me about exist but don't tell me anything else about
05.12.23, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like Jinte not telling me what he costume was gonna be or things like that
05.12.23, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The size of the thing I don't know doesn't matter whatsoever
05.12.23, 23:34 - Niki: Yeah i thought so 😅.
05.12.23, 23:35 - Niki: The think is i dont know if he joins dnd for the people or dnd because if he doesn't like dnd its weird. Also i am not sure if he will "behave"
05.12.23, 23:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well he can try it out and see if he likes it? Kinda hard to tell if he hasn't done it before. And if he does it for the people alone... Well, idk, will have to see how Alex and Jinte react to him then?
About him "behaving" idk, why do you think he wouldn't?
05.12.23, 23:38 - Niki: He is weird sometimes and i am not sure about the howl think. Still skeptical over all
05.12.23, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough, in the end it's your decision, you're the DM, if you think it's too difficult or you're not sure about it to add him in for next session then that's just that.
05.12.23, 23:40 - Niki: Yeah adding him right now is outer the picture i think so will see next time
05.12.23, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's very fair
05.12.23, 23:41 - Niki: But i am also going to sleep now tired like alot
05.12.23, 23:41 - Niki: Goodnight hon ❤️ love you 😘

06.12.23, 20:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, they also have been doing so for a while, but still need Kickstarter for a new product so that means they 1) don't have investors (or not wealthy ones anyway) and 2) probably not a lot of sales/a bad business plan
06.12.23, 20:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or, well, another option is that they just want to see what the market could be for the new product
06.12.23, 20:49 - Niki: Yeah will take with the others about it and will see
06.12.23, 20:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, hope you at least get some interesting things from it

07.12.23, 15:03 - Niki: How was the ending ?
07.12.23, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no, the book is done, but the other 400 pages are just an entirely different book apparently, which was quite a surprise
07.12.23, 15:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The ending was really nice, but a bit too happy if that makes sense?
07.12.23, 15:04 - Niki: Yeah i think i know waht you mean

08.12.23, 14:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should I be proud of this?
08.12.23, 14:53 - Niki: oh damm ?
08.12.23, 14:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, he asked who recently got their driver's licence, I put my hand up and eh said "Oh, you've done a couple of things before haven't you?" So yeah

08.12.23, 14:57 - Niki: well yeah u did since norway
08.12.23, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, and a couple other things, I usually am the one who answers in his class... out of 600 students
08.12.23, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In this case I'm the person who drove over the professor and broke his scull, it's great :)))
08.12.23, 15:02 - Niki: XD
08.12.23, 15:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *skull

08.12.23, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
08.12.23, 15:03 - Niki: XD
08.12.23, 15:05 - Niki: What does it say exactly that youe driving him to death with the volvo?
08.12.23, 15:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, on the left is Bertel (the prof) and on the right there is me in my Volvo driving too fast (but the car looks more like a steamboat on wheels) <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
08.12.23, 15:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So essentially it's a drawing of the seconds before disaster
08.12.23, 15:09 - Niki: Kk
08.12.23, 15:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now the guy is calling me a drunk
08.12.23, 15:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, this is too funny
08.12.23, 15:19 - Niki: Drunk driving is a big danger
08.12.23, 15:19 - Niki: Also he doesn't know you at all😅 jk
08.12.23, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, it's really funny. he asked a guy about the legal driving limit (he didn't know) and then how much is in a 2 meters of beer (he also didn't know and said I couldn't drink that) so the prof then said that I definitely know how to drink well 😂
08.12.23, 17:13 - Niki: Going to Leipzig now to hang out with Patrick. How is your day going hon ❤️?
08.12.23, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice, have fun! Going alright, gonna try limoncello for the first time now 😅
08.12.23, 17:15 - Niki: What is limocello?
08.12.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a lemon liquor I guess? My dad makes it himself
08.12.23, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically my first time drinking hard liquor, or at least trying it because I took a sip and holy shit it is very fucking strong but I didn't like the taste that much 😅
08.12.23, 17:17 - Niki: Damm sounds nice
08.12.23, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can try it when you get here, he's making a new batch with special lemons now
08.12.23, 17:17 - Niki: Ah okay would love to try it. Sounds good though even though you don't like it
08.12.23, 17:17 - Niki: Bless him 🙏🏼
08.12.23, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, might just be because it's my first time trying it 😅
08.12.23, 17:20 - Niki: Probably to be honest or its just to much alcohol
08.12.23, 17:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, the effect of the alcohol didn't really bother me too much, though it definitely was stronger than I was expecting it to be 😅 It was more the flavour, but yeah, maybe I'll like it more in the future, I will try the next batch though because it's supposed to be sweeter
08.12.23, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And according to my dad this batch that I tried was the lowest alcohol percentage so far so yeah, will see how strong the next is
08.12.23, 17:28 - Niki: Okay will see if i will like it
08.12.23, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can only try and find out
08.12.23, 17:31 - Niki: Yeah
08.12.23, 17:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun in Leipzig 😘

08.12.23, 18:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently with Barrie he does
08.12.23, 18:28 - Niki: Crazy he really doesn't like him or wants him near him
08.12.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, it's a hate-love relationship, but he likes his personal space I think 😅
08.12.23, 19:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

09.12.23, 00:16 - Niki: *It
09.12.23, 00:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My night was alright, my aunt and Pieter came over, my dad cooked some food and made the booze, the chicken was pretty undercooked though, so we had to explain to Pieter what salmonella is 😅
09.12.23, 00:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll tell you next time 😘
09.12.23, 00:17 - Niki: Man Peter sometimes it seems he grew up in a plastic ball
09.12.23, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also found out 2 sexual terms because of my family 😅 a Trojan Warhelmet and a German helmet, had absolutely no clue about either of those
09.12.23, 00:17 - Niki: Else you just talk about?
09.12.23, 00:17 - Niki: ?
09.12.23, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, when we just got to know him he didn't even know how to peel a shrimp 😅
09.12.23, 00:17 - Niki: Tell me more i am interested
09.12.23, 00:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Trojan Warhelmet is basically when the guy puts his balls on the eyes and then the penis on the nose
09.12.23, 00:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And a German helmet is another way of saying the tip of the penis
09.12.23, 00:18 - Niki: Well i dont know that either or i think i dont know. Or is it just take the tail and the head and pull
09.12.23, 00:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No one of my family knew this one though, found it by accident 😅
09.12.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but you're a vegetarian, you have a proper excuse
09.12.23, 00:19 - Niki: WTF? Some people do that
09.12.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently
09.12.23, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess it's an advanced way of teabagging someone?
09.12.23, 00:20 - Niki: Hahah
09.12.23, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also asked me what I want for my birthday
09.12.23, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which I don't know 😊
09.12.23, 00:20 - Niki: And what do you want
09.12.23, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Absolutely no clue
09.12.23, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well
09.12.23, 00:20 - Niki: Me 🥺?
09.12.23, 00:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eventually I said a second cat knowing the odds of getting one are very low
09.12.23, 00:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't just want you for my birthday, I want you for the rest of my life
09.12.23, 00:21 - Niki: Would be nice though
09.12.23, 00:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, somehow my dad seemed on board though, so who knows?

09.12.23, 00:24 - Niki: Hahha
09.12.23, 00:24 - Niki: We start typing together all the time and then stoping at the same time?
09.12.23, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
09.12.23, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just see you start typing so I don't want to interrupt you 😅
09.12.23, 00:25 - Niki: Yeah same
09.12.23, 00:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's our one brain cell working together in a stupid way
09.12.23, 00:25 - Niki: But we can take our time with that one mabye 6~7 years
09.12.23, 00:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahah
09.12.23, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was gonna say the same thing
09.12.23, 00:26 - Niki: One brain cell
09.12.23, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No rush on anything, let's just enjoy ourselves as much as we can
09.12.23, 00:26 - Niki: Cutie lets do
09.12.23, 00:27 - Niki: But i wanna enjoy you though 😳
09.12.23, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, at least we're not religious so we don't have to wait with that 😘
09.12.23, 00:28 - Niki: I mean would be to let for that anyway 🤭
09.12.23, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True
09.12.23, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Though I have heard something about renewed virgin's
09.12.23, 00:28 - Niki: ? What
09.12.23, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Something about renewing your pledge to god and abstaining from sex again as if you're a reborn virgin, it's fucking weird 😅
09.12.23, 00:29 - Niki: Well I would take your virginity as often as you want 🥵
09.12.23, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite frankly hon, while I look back quite fondly on your first time, I think losing my virginity one time was quite enough
09.12.23, 00:31 - Niki: Yeah first time was nice but wouldn't like to go back <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
09.12.23, 00:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I think we've improved quite a lot since then
09.12.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And there's so much we still have to try 😘
09.12.23, 00:32 - Niki: Man talking about sex with you makes me kinda Horry
09.12.23, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, totally get that feeling
09.12.23, 00:32 - Niki: Yes there is 😘
09.12.23, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know, I keep hearing people say that once you're on birth control your sex drive totally disappears or something but I definitely don't have that issue 😅
09.12.23, 00:34 - Niki: That's great i would also be a bit confused if that would happen and not engage in somw of the aktivatis
09.12.23, 00:36 - Niki: But i would also love for you to be bad so i would start spanking you or mabye you would start not wearing any underwear well there is a lot of possibility for ypu to secretly start abit
09.12.23, 00:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, now I'm on the pill for more than 3 months the side effects shouldn't really show up anymore so I'm quite happy that I don't really have any real side effects
09.12.23, 00:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn hon, you're really horny huh?
09.12.23, 00:37 - Niki: Yup kinda make myself horny with that text

09.12.23, 01:04 - Niki: Will keep you to your dirty words and glady will bend you over
09.12.23, 01:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you manage to make me unable to walk you deserve a medal and I would love nothing more than to feel you having fucked me for days after

09.12.23, 01:07 - Niki: Well i would glady try the challenge

09.12.23, 11:09 - Niki: My mom will make a birthday / Christmas package for you.
09.12.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She is way too sweet she definitely doesn't have to do all that, I love your mom 🥺
09.12.23, 11:10 - Niki: Yeah sure if you study until then tonight will be fine
09.12.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah but no, the party would be until tomorrow so it's a bad idea if I still want to study tomorrow 😅
09.12.23, 11:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not gonna go, don't have the clothes for it anyway

09.12.23, 18:58 - Niki: Didn't work yet just got the keys
09.12.23, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doesn't usually happen I guess? She's gonna help you guys too or she's gonna do something else while you work?
09.12.23, 19:05 - Niki: Nope doesn't happen alot. Also not sure what she's going do?
09.12.23, 19:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, I hope she has a good time anyway

09.12.23, 19:06 - Niki: Yeah for sure
09.12.23, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Moustache is a moron
09.12.23, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We got a new fireplace kinda thing, and the fucking moron decides to put his paw on it while it's  on 🥲
09.12.23, 20:26 - Niki: Poor moron hope he learned his lesson and it heals fast
09.12.23, 20:27 - Niki: Finally back at the hotel now a shower and the sleep
09.12.23, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He didn't get hurt thankfully, was immediately back to being a menace, threw over our food waste to find chicken 😅

09.12.23, 20:31 - Niki: No with out you i can hardly enjoy it

09.12.23, 21:13 - Niki: Done with the shower
09.12.23, 21:13 - Niki: How was your day hon ❤️
09.12.23, 21:14 - Niki: Did you get to study?
09.12.23, 21:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Procrastinated a bit too much, but I helped my grandpa with some tech stuff so that's something I guess?
09.12.23, 21:15 - Niki: Being a great grandchild 👍🏻
09.12.23, 21:16 - Niki: How are you procrasting in a fun way atleast?
09.12.23, 21:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: His only one around so yeah, gotta be
09.12.23, 21:16 - Niki: The best one
09.12.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, not really, just read, talked to Jinte and Instagram 😅
09.12.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty useless stuff
09.12.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Debatable for him I'd say
09.12.23, 21:18 - Niki: Oh well would say that Instagram mabye
09.12.23, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah fair
09.12.23, 21:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was the food btw?
09.12.23, 21:20 - Niki: Okayish was a pizza with mushrooms nothing special
09.12.23, 21:21 - Niki: Also how is jinte whats up?
09.12.23, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair
09.12.23, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh man
09.12.23, 21:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Her cousin's boyfriend is probably hitting on her
09.12.23, 21:22 - Niki: What tell me more
09.12.23, 21:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The guy sent her a picture of himself half naked before and yesterday at the funeral and the service after that he was sitting in-between Jinte and her cousin, but practically only talked to Jinte for the whole day
09.12.23, 21:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Even Jinte's brother asked her if he was hitting on her
09.12.23, 21:24 - Niki: Damm and her cousin didn't notice?
09.12.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And now today he sent er a message essentially saying she is very nice 😏😏
09.12.23, 21:24 - Niki: Did she talked with her cousin?
09.12.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think she did, but doesn't do anything about it?
09.12.23, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: About this? No don't think so because he's never outright done something
09.12.23, 21:24 - Niki: Damm what a fucked up relationship
09.12.23, 21:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Even the picture he sent her was "Oh shit, sorry, meant to send that to Jana, both your names kinda look the same" <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
09.12.23, 21:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp... What we think too, but she doesn't see it I guess
09.12.23, 21:26 - Niki: Man what a save 😂
09.12.23, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, definitely, Jinte doesn't like him at all 😅
09.12.23, 21:27 - Niki: Damm okay jinte real attracts weird people kinda or they find jinte attractive
09.12.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, she definitely does
09.12.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's crazy how often too
09.12.23, 21:28 - Niki: Kinda calming i am not weird 😅
09.12.23, 21:29 - Niki: Yup kinda alarming
09.12.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In what way? Because you're not attracted to Jinte or what? 😂
09.12.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely
09.12.23, 21:29 - Niki: Yup not attracted to jinte == not a weirdo kinda not really just joking
09.12.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Told her that next time she should go for someone who is from a country with a red flag so maybe this time she's not attracted to the personality red flags😂
09.12.23, 21:30 - Niki: She will find somebody and we will look for the red flag then
09.12.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, definitely
09.12.23, 21:30 - Niki: Hahaha trick the system
09.12.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly :)
09.12.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Though to be fair, Alex is half Chinese so that's already out, I'm betting it's Turkish next
09.12.23, 21:32 - Niki: We still have a lot of options
09.12.23, 21:32 - Niki: Mabye marocco?
09.12.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooohhh
09.12.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well
09.12.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Does Sam count for that because she met him there or nah?
09.12.23, 21:33 - Niki: Nah
09.12.23, 21:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then that's still an option
09.12.23, 21:33 - Niki: I also thought that but no
09.12.23, 21:33 - Niki: ?
09.12.23, 21:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A Moroccan guy is still possible is what I'm trying to say 😅
09.12.23, 21:33 - Niki: Ah yeah
09.12.23, 21:34 - Niki: The system still works
09.12.23, 21:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Guess so
09.12.23, 21:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any bets you want to make? Jinte says the next one is gonna be 32
09.12.23, 21:35 - Niki: No the next one will be a nice guy not from Belgium though with a mustache
09.12.23, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very interesting
09.12.23, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you're right, except the not from Belgium part
09.12.23, 21:35 - Niki: The cards told me soooooo oooh
09.12.23, 21:36 - Niki: Why not?
09.12.23, 21:36 - Niki: I am not from Belgium 🥲
09.12.23, 21:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yo, I have tarot cards, I can actually try to see what they say, even if it's fake 😂
09.12.23, 21:36 - Niki: I am nice
09.12.23, 21:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know hon, and I love you, but I do not wish a long distance relationship on my best friend, because it's not easy. And I think she deserves easy after the bullshit love life she's had so far
09.12.23, 21:37 - Niki: Okay i see 🥲. Nah jk. Mabye a person from...
09.12.23, 21:37 - Niki: The Nederlands
09.12.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No
09.12.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Our of principal
09.12.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No
09.12.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The fucking accent 😭
09.12.23, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess maybe France, Germany or Luxemburg right over the border would be fine, but she was already worrying that Brussels was too far soooo, perhaps not
09.12.23, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not like there's much to influence though, we'll just have to see who she takes home next
09.12.23, 21:40 - Niki: Yeah but i have my predictions and if i get them right i will chuckle abit when i meet him
09.12.23, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, definitely
09.12.23, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will chuckle right alongside you
09.12.23, 21:42 - Niki: Cutie but else anything interesting happend
09.12.23, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uh... A guy from her student association also hit on her but nothing serious, it wasn't obvious so she just ignored it
09.12.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or did you mean today? Because in that case not really
09.12.23, 21:47 - Niki: Meant today but yeah
09.12.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah okay
09.12.23, 21:47 - Niki: Still jinte is getting hit on alot
09.12.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
09.12.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely
09.12.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's kinda crazy to hear how often girls get hit on
09.12.23, 21:49 - Niki: Yeah mostly hearing it from you though 😅
09.12.23, 21:50 - Niki: Mabye jinte needs abig dog how is really scary but really nice to her <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
09.12.23, 21:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well I just hear it from my friends, not like I experience it myself so yeah 😅 Jinte could be lying and my whole dataset is fucked up 😂
09.12.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are we talking about a guy who resembles a big scary dog or an actual dog?
09.12.23, 21:51 - Niki: Source trust me homie
09.12.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 100%
09.12.23, 21:51 - Niki: Could be either
09.12.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair fair
09.12.23, 21:51 - Niki: Was thinking about a dog though
09.12.23, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't really go out with a big Danish dog though
09.12.23, 21:52 - Niki: Second think when i think about her. Is just "dog" <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
09.12.23, 21:52 - Niki: Yeah wouldn't think so either
09.12.23, 21:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is very accurate
09.12.23, 21:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also Jinte's list of requirements for a bf is alarmingly short
09.12.23, 21:54 - Niki: That could be one reason for the red flags in person she allways dates
09.12.23, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, it's apparently caused by her experience with red flags
09.12.23, 21:54 - Niki: Oh okay interesting
09.12.23, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, therapy would not be bad I guess
09.12.23, 21:56 - Niki: ?
09.12.23, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was reading her requirements whoopd
09.12.23, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
09.12.23, 21:58 - Niki: That's one um well yeah
09.12.23, 21:59 - Niki: I mean... Ah
09.12.23, 21:59 - Niki: So low
09.12.23, 21:59 - Niki: Kinda sad to be honest
09.12.23, 22:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's what I told her too
09.12.23, 22:47 - Niki: Sorry that i didn't answer anymore kinda fell asleep with my handy playing a you tube video 😅
09.12.23, 22:47 - Niki: Also going to sleep now

10.12.23, 15:59 - Niki: You know any good chocolate from Germany?
10.12.23, 16:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can definitely believe that, hope you had lunch too though 😅
10.12.23, 16:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uh... I know Ritter Sport and apparently according to my research Merci is also German, which makes absolutely no sense
10.12.23, 16:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're alright, but Belgian and Swiss (I have to admit they're pretty alright) are better as far as my preferences go
10.12.23, 16:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why do you ask?
10.12.23, 16:13 - Niki: My mom ask for somebody else
10.12.23, 16:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, cool
10.12.23, 16:34 - Niki: Man works sucks
10.12.23, 16:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How come? Tired or just annoying things to do?

10.12.23, 20:09 - Niki: Eat also
10.12.23, 20:10 - Niki: How was your day hon?
10.12.23, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was pretty good, slept too long though, my grandparents came to visit and I studied a bit, nothing really special
10.12.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also had an argument with my dad about the way he programmed the lights because it's annoying as hell
10.12.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When you turn the tv on, all the other lights go off now 😅
10.12.23, 20:11 - Niki: Best way
10.12.23, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Terribly annoying when anyone else is doing anything at all
10.12.23, 20:12 - Niki: But over all sounds really nice. Did your dad change the lights after the argument
10.12.23, 20:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not after the argument

11.12.23, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was good, had pasta at a nearby restaurant. Wasn't gonna go at first but my parents convinced me to at least walk there and then decide
11.12.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You played with legos again or something else this time?
11.12.23, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, I was looking up the lego miata set and I think it's made up 😅 couldn't find it at all
11.12.23, 21:30 - Niki: Some games different one like hide and seek or "mensch Ärger dich nicht"
11.12.23, 21:30 - Niki: Yeah could well be
11.12.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, German and dutch are the fucking same language
11.12.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We call that game Mens Erger Je Niet
11.12.23, 21:30 - Niki: He won as to be expect
11.12.23, 21:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Of course he did
11.12.23, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Especially with your weird rule that the youngest should always win
11.12.23, 21:31 - Niki: Good work off your parents. 🥰
11.12.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I did need that
11.12.23, 21:32 - Niki: Well if he is not a asshole why not?
11.12.23, 21:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, kids should learn from young that they can't always win, life ain't fair bitch
11.12.23, 21:33 - Niki: Yeah but they will learn that soon enough
11.12.23, 21:33 - Niki: But anyways how are you feeling hon?
11.12.23, 21:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm.. maybe, don't know if that's relevant or not, but you can definitely see how we were raised differently in this way 😅
11.12.23, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alive, miss you, not mathematical
11.12.23, 21:35 - Niki: Yeah probably more factors than that but yeah
11.12.23, 21:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, but this is just one where it's clear right now
11.12.23, 21:36 - Niki: That's a really good description
11.12.23, 21:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you say so hon
11.12.23, 21:36 - Niki: Hope you can wait another 15 days and 1 hour
11.12.23, 21:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well I don't really have another option do I?
11.12.23, 21:38 - Niki: Not really but just so you know if there was a option that would make everyone happy and i could be with you right now i would do anything for it ❤️
11.12.23, 21:39 - Niki: Miss you like crszy but my weeks are also pact with stuff to do and meetings and family time its crazy
11.12.23, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie, but yeah, not really possible so nothing we can do about it ❤️
11.12.23, 21:40 - Niki: Thats way more depressing when we say it out loud but its the truth 🥲🥺 i want you badly
11.12.23, 21:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, get that, my weeks are much less packed though, just this weekend and then studying until you're here practically

11.12.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And impossible
11.12.23, 21:43 - Niki: Yeah thought so to both
11.12.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would have to start studying every time I try to fall asleep then
11.12.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: and every time I'm looking at the time
11.12.23, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And every time I open anything on my phone or laptop

11.12.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't believe you capable of that
11.12.23, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But okay
11.12.23, 21:46 - Niki: I will try 😅
11.12.23, 21:47 - Niki: But if you start saying it first its okay to talk about it?
11.12.23, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah obviously
11.12.23, 21:47 - Niki: Okay okay just making sure
11.12.23, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Imagine if I start bitching about studying, you try to comfort me and I'm just "Hey, you promised you wouldn't talk about it, the fuck?" and got mad, damn, what a bitch I would be
11.12.23, 21:49 - Niki: I thought more about trying to bait to break it as a joke but yeah
11.12.23, 21:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
11.12.23, 21:50 - Niki: I just love you soooo much that I wanna make sure you try your best. In every thing you do.

18.12.23, 18:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
18.12.23, 19:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alles oke with you?
18.12.23, 19:08 - Niki: Ja warum fragst du?
18.12.23, 19:09 - Niki: Or was that not meant to sound a bit german
18.12.23, 19:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No it was
18.12.23, 19:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just making sure you're okay 😘
18.12.23, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although in my defence this is technically also Dutch so I made it easy for myself 😅
18.12.23, 19:12 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
18.12.23, 19:12 - Niki: Okay
18.12.23, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also maybe overreading into text intonation again 😅
18.12.23, 19:14 - Niki: What did your intonation
18.12.23, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like I said, just overreading
18.12.23, 19:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My dad found my ID from when I was 6 😅
18.12.23, 19:27 - Niki: PLEASE I NEED A PICTURE
18.12.23, 19:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
18.12.23, 19:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It would have been way too fucking easy to commit identity fraud in 2008
18.12.23, 19:28 - Niki: Ahwww small manon looks so cute
18.12.23, 19:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The hairband in the picture was a hello kitty hairband btw
18.12.23, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also love how my mom looked at it and was just like "hmm, yes, you were very cute back then, but now your face isn't that round anymore" 😂
18.12.23, 19:29 - Niki: Damm
18.12.23, 19:29 - Niki: Yeah very cute i agree now and then
18.12.23, 19:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon 😅❤️
19.12.23, 00:39 - Niki: I am playing games again wait to long but we need to end on a win. How is your night going still up?
19.12.23, 00:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you playing? Also ending on a win is what gets people to lose all their money in a casino so keep to just games yeah 😜
19.12.23, 00:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Night is going alright, just don't feel like going to sleep yet. Not tired at all
19.12.23, 00:41 - Niki: Âh okay yeah playing lol with marco
19.12.23, 00:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aha, hope it's fun 😊
19.12.23, 00:45 - Niki: thx hope you have fun to what ever u do
19.12.23, 00:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, just scrolling social media and the news, nothing riveting
19.12.23, 00:48 - Niki: ah okay well
19.12.23, 00:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I know, I'm boring
19.12.23, 00:51 - Niki: Well wouldnt say boring just less crazy
19.12.23, 00:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Interesting way of phrasing things
19.12.23, 00:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 1 crazy thing I did today though was drinking limoncello again, the new batch is a lot better than the old one
19.12.23, 00:52 - Niki: Yeah i am now for that
19.12.23, 00:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love that
19.12.23, 00:53 - Niki: oh really well
19.12.23, 00:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
19.12.23, 00:54 - Niki: And how you like it ?
19.12.23, 00:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tried to see if my dad is right and alcohol helps with a sore throat. Either I didn't drink enough (just 3 sips) or it's bullshit
19.12.23, 00:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it tastes pretty good
19.12.23, 00:55 - Niki: its bull
19.12.23, 00:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still not something I'd easily have a lot of though, the smell of the alcohol isn't so nice
19.12.23, 00:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good to know
19.12.23, 00:58 - Niki: Yeah 100% agree one the smell. So far its not getting better either
19.12.23, 00:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Lovely
19.12.23, 01:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, guess I'm not gonna turn into an alcoholic anytime soon, this is great news 😊 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
19.12.23, 01:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 🥳

19.12.23, 01:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is you indeed 😘
19.12.23, 01:03 - Niki: What's going through your mind right now?
19.12.23, 01:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, I'm thinking of my next goals in life, like winning the Nobel prize, going to Africa to help vaccinate kids, building schools with my bare hands, you know, the casual things
19.12.23, 01:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe on the side becoming US president
19.12.23, 01:05 - Niki: Okay sure so legally blond stuff i see
19.12.23, 01:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly
19.12.23, 01:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man
19.12.23, 01:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That third movie really has to come out soon, I have to know if she's actually running for president
19.12.23, 01:06 - Niki: We will see i geuss
19.12.23, 01:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope so, I know it was delayed but it could turn out cancelled who knows?
19.12.23, 01:06 - Niki: But will definitely watch it together 🥺
19.12.23, 01:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 100% ❤️
19.12.23, 01:06 - Niki: Hope not
19.12.23, 01:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope not too, but we'll see
19.12.23, 01:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any other movies that are coming out that you wanna watch?
19.12.23, 01:07 - Niki: But I am going to sleep now.
19.12.23, 01:07 - Niki: Nope not really
19.12.23, 01:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, you won a game then?
19.12.23, 01:07 - Niki: Nope but tired
19.12.23, 01:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
19.12.23, 01:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Next time 😘
19.12.23, 01:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 🍀
19.12.23, 01:08 - Niki: Don't really get into the movie hype anymore got to often disappoint about canceling and shitty movies
19.12.23, 01:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Unfortunately that's a very understandable feeling
19.12.23, 01:09 - Niki: Goodnight my most beloved girl in the world love you ❤️
19.12.23, 01:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also going to the movie theatre is fucking expensive these days, crazy
19.12.23, 01:09 - Niki: Yup its getting out of hand
19.12.23, 01:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my wonderful and absolutely breathtaking boyfriend, sweet dreams my love ❤️
19.12.23, 01:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too 😘
19.12.23, 02:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you to the ends of the universe. And I would add back, but since it's ever expanding and ∞+∞=∞ that's a bit unnecessary
19.12.23, 09:00 - Niki: Smart and sweet hon ❤️. Also i think its expanding faster than light
19.12.23, 09:01 - Niki: Good morning by the way 🥰
19.12.23, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning my love 😘
19.12.23, 13:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Important question
19.12.23, 13:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you want to watch the new Percy Jackson series with me?
19.12.23, 13:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm asking to know if I should wait with watching it until next week
19.12.23, 13:38 - Niki: Jup sound nice
19.12.23, 13:38 - Niki: Would glady do that
19.12.23, 13:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okido, I'll try to hold off from seeing spoilers then
19.12.23, 13:47 - Niki: I am also trying even though i think for me it wound be that hard
19.12.23, 13:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, may the odds be ever in your favour still <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
19.12.23, 13:52 - Niki: Same to you melady
19.12.23, 13:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you Milord
19.12.23, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Always fucking random when people show up out of nowhere and send you a message after like a year
19.12.23, 17:32 - Niki: Huh what happened?
19.12.23, 17:33 - Niki: Also cleaning is exsausting.
19.12.23, 17:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Zohra, a person Jinte and I were friends with in high school (mind you we haven't seen her in 7 years) just randomly sent a message in our groupchat that somehow is still alive
19.12.23, 17:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, cleaning is definitely exhausting
19.12.23, 17:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's it going though, managed to get a lot done already?
19.12.23, 17:35 - Niki: What did she send? What did you two do? Atleast write her back or not?
19.12.23, 17:35 - Niki: Didn't study much. Cleaned up though and now either food making or ordering i have no idea
19.12.23, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
19.12.23, 17:36 - Niki: Really
19.12.23, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I wrote her back, just talked a bit about how life is going
19.12.23, 17:36 - Niki: Tell me more
19.12.23, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, this is the person why Jinte and I used to have yearly star wars marathons
19.12.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Make food please, otherwise it's gonna be way too late after DnD hon
19.12.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Take care of yourself first 😘
19.12.23, 17:37 - Niki: Will do no worries
19.12.23, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically she's been living in Edinburgh with her bf for a while now, but they are both unemployed and live with his parents so they hope to find a job to move out soon
19.12.23, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And her brother recently had a baby
19.12.23, 17:38 - Niki: Crazy
19.12.23, 17:38 - Niki: Thats a story. What are thex looking for job wise and England really 😅
19.12.23, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, it's definitely crazy for me because this is kind of the same thing she said when we spoke last which is almost a year ago? So the fact nothing has really changed is crazy
19.12.23, 17:39 - Niki: By the way did the package arrive?
19.12.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Scotland technically hon 😜
She wants a job in graphic design and he wants a job in construction or as a mechanic
19.12.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope
19.12.23, 17:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least not as far as I'm aware
19.12.23, 17:39 - Niki: Ih damm well mabye its been a roller-coaster if a year but they got back to the start
19.12.23, 17:40 - Niki: Ah okay yeah right Scotland ups 😅
19.12.23, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, maybe, don't know but I hope they find something soon because as much as I love my parents, I could definitely not imagine living with them for a very long time as a couple 😅
19.12.23, 17:41 - Niki: Yeah especially when your job searching
19.12.23, 17:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And to do so with the in-laws… well, they might be nice but yeah, still would prefer some privacy
19.12.23, 17:43 - Niki: Yeah 100%. Like i love your parents but i don't wanna live with them or atleast not for a long time. Also a own space for just the two of us sounds fucking amazing
19.12.23, 17:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes it really does
19.12.23, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Looking forward to that
19.12.23, 17:53 - Niki: Same will be great
19.12.23, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: handsome bastard
19.12.23, 23:17 - Niki: oh you cutie ❤️
19.12.23, 23:41 - Niki: Goodnight my love❤️
19.12.23, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
19.12.23, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't care what you do but I will stay up for 20 more minutes
19.12.23, 23:45 - Niki: Yeah will do the same ❤️
19.12.23, 23:46 - Niki: Your a cutie hon 😘. Also i nearly forgot because of dnd
19.12.23, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You almost forgot I'm a cutie because of DnD? Can't believe it 🫣😜
19.12.23, 23:47 - Niki: And a dork sometimes
19.12.23, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, if you think that's only sometimes I'm not trying hard enough 😉
19.12.23, 23:50 - Niki: Well you can try but  expect a dork answer back
19.12.23, 23:50 - Niki: Man wording in English sometimes i rewrite my sentences like 3 times
19.12.23, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's exactly what I do it for 😘
19.12.23, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, get that, but I usually send before I check, so then you get edits 😅
19.12.23, 23:55 - Niki: Yeah also do that from time to time but sometimes i just wanna send the right message so yeah
19.12.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, that makes total sense
19.12.23, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Especially when you're in the middle of a conversation and can't change it before the other person reads it
19.12.23, 23:56 - Niki: Yup
19.12.23, 23:57 - Niki: Feeling kinda funny waiting for it. But like in a good warm fuzzy way.
19.12.23, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah same, just kind of hard to believe it's been a year already
19.12.23, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And at the same time that it's only been a year 😅
19.12.23, 23:57 - Niki: Yeah crazy right
19.12.23, 23:58 - Niki: Will see were the adventure goes but i am glad your with me
19.12.23, 23:58 - Niki: Also excited for the future
19.12.23, 23:59 - Niki: Also like one year ago norway crazy how that is "only" and already a year ago
19.12.23, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same, it's been a wonderful adventure so far, let's hope it goes on for a very very long while further 😘 Can't wait to see what happens
19.12.23, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, exactly!! Norway feels like a dream most of the time for me
20.12.23, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, it's official my love, 1 year done, many more to go 😘❤️

20.12.23, 00:14 - Niki: Dont let me start on your beautiful and gorgeous body cant wait to feel it again. Make me horny just thinking about us together again.
20.12.23, 00:14 - Niki: But befor i go any further probably sleep will be better

20.12.23, 10:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, same for me unfortunately :(
20.12.23, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is it weird for me to be kind of proud of us for managing to make this work for at least a year now? Because I am kind of proud of us for that 😊
20.12.23, 12:01 - Niki: Yeah get what you mean like its not that crazy to think about but still makes me proud
20.12.23, 16:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going my love?
20.12.23, 16:28 - Niki: Still in uni else pretty good
20.12.23, 16:53 - Niki: By the way the package should be with your neighbors
20.12.23, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What
20.12.23, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How?
20.12.23, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you know which neighbours and when it got delivered?
20.12.23, 16:55 - Niki: Nope
20.12.23, 16:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... Interesting, because I've been home all day, the front door has been open all day, and yesterday both my parents and I were home all day so if it didn't get here would be kind of weird
20.12.23, 16:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll check anyway
20.12.23, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Asked one of the neighbours, they didn't get it 😅
20.12.23, 17:09 - Niki: Dont know my mom just called me saying its at your neighbors. Since Thursday
20.12.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What
20.12.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Crazy
20.12.23, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll ask my mom to ask around in the street WhatsApp I guess
20.12.23, 17:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm afraid I'm gonna need more info to track the package down, either someone didn't think to inform us, stole it or it was delivered in the wrong place, but it's probably not in our street 😅
20.12.23, 18:21 - Niki: Will send u the tracking number when my mom send it to me
20.12.23, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon 😘

20.12.23, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, that was really just a backhanded way to tell you to not forget about me

20.12.23, 22:02 - Niki: okay sorry feel bad now 🥺

20.12.23, 22:10 - Niki: Yeah it was 🥲
20.12.23, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just a tiny bit annoyed that today of all days I would have to remind you to think of asking me how I'm doing
20.12.23, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The sickness and period are probably not helping that
20.12.23, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But still

23.12.23, 11:25 - Niki: He swallowed it and Puck it up

06.01.24, 15:20 - Niki: Yeah so far
06.01.24, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite alright I think, it's somehow easier to understand the more difficult stuff 😅
06.01.24, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How were the Palmier cookies btw?
06.01.24, 15:21 - Niki: Really good like them but can't eat that much at once

06.01.24, 19:08 - Niki: Nope didn't
06.01.24, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, thought you wouldn't
06.01.24, 19:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy 😘

07.01.24, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon 😘
07.01.24, 11:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could be worse
07.01.24, 11:29 - Niki: Yeah 🥰
07.01.24, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When you have some time, let me know how the show was yesterday?
07.01.24, 11:46 - Niki: Will do
07.01.24, 11:50 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.01.24, 11:50 - Niki: The story was meh but the visuals where really good
07.01.24, 12:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, that is a giant room
07.01.24, 12:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There was a watershow??? And trampolines? That almost sounds like a Cirque du Soleil performance
07.01.24, 12:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What was the story even about?
07.01.24, 12:21 - Niki: About the openness and the future of us. Its abit weird but yeah i don't how to describe over text
07.01.24, 13:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aha... Yeah sounds interesting
07.01.24, 13:17 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.01.24, 13:17 - Niki: Elias
07.01.24, 13:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goddamn
07.01.24, 13:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're really getting married this summer huh?
07.01.24, 13:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for the clarification 😂
07.01.24, 13:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What does Elias do as a job again?
07.01.24, 13:42 - Niki: Software dev
07.01.24, 13:42 - Niki: Yeah
07.01.24, 13:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, right, I forgot
07.01.24, 17:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going hon?
07.01.24, 17:12 - Niki: Good still out will text you later 😘
07.01.24, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, have fun! 😊
07.01.24, 18:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So Fabian found my Instagram account I am guessing
07.01.24, 18:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is it like a "thing" in your friend group to have exactly 5 posts or is that just Fabian and Alex? It's an odd coincidence
07.01.24, 19:06 - Niki: Its a odd coincidence
07.01.24, 20:42 - Niki: Now in the train to Leipzig we got a bit lucky
07.01.24, 20:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me guess, last train? 😂😜
07.01.24, 20:43 - Niki: Day was great didn't really know what to do so we did some museums and a "mirror house? " if you know what i mean.
07.01.24, 20:44 - Niki: Nah we got one earlier because we were dead mentally and thankfully they let us in 🙏🏼
07.01.24, 20:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mirror house like different sizes and shapes mirrors or a mirror labyrinth?
07.01.24, 20:44 - Niki: Mirror labyrinth <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
07.01.24, 20:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope the drive back is chill then, what do you mean with "let you in"?
07.01.24, 20:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like you have mirrors everywhere and you need to get out? I don't know how to explain it but they're always at carnivals here 😅
07.01.24, 20:45 - Niki: We ask if we could get on because the other one was delayed so yeah it worked somehow
07.01.24, 20:46 - Niki: Yeah right this one but you need to find a code to get out which was on the mirrors
07.01.24, 20:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.01.24, 20:46 - Niki: Yes
07.01.24, 20:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A code? Sounds cool, the one I know you just have to make sure not to walk into the glass walls 😅😂
07.01.24, 20:51 - Niki: Yeah but you already got 2 numbers givem and the rest you found if you look for them fast
07.01.24, 20:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hard to imagine but sounds nice
07.01.24, 20:53 - Niki: It was was close to the the check point Carly
07.01.24, 20:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, nice! What other museums you went to?
07.01.24, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know, it would be really interesting statistical research to see what the average time between reading and answering a text is
07.01.24, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The standard deviation has to be insane
07.01.24, 22:10 - Niki: Ups yeah sorry we got abit of stress because of the ticket think ans i forgot
07.01.24, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What happened with the ticket maybe?
07.01.24, 22:11 - Niki: But yeah i would say it would be interesting. I would geuss somewhere around 10 min? Or 2p
07.01.24, 22:11 - Niki: *20
07.01.24, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would have to actually look into it, also have to determine the moment a response counts, like in a conversation already or just a message sent out of nowhere, results would be very different
07.01.24, 22:12 - Niki: Just going with early train. We weren't sure if she told everybody and alex was really worried about it and made me worried then too
07.01.24, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahh, I see
07.01.24, 22:13 - Niki: Yup for sure
07.01.24, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still think it's stupid your tickets only count on a specific train
07.01.24, 22:13 - Niki: About Germany colonies in Africa and Asia. Alot of stuff and really spezific. Was cool
07.01.24, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds cool yeah
07.01.24, 22:14 - Niki: Yeah its weird because it still can move its weird db is not that translucent
07.01.24, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're back in Chemnitz now or still on the way?
07.01.24, 22:15 - Niki: On the way to my parents house and staying the night
07.01.24, 22:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We have a museum for that in Belgium (about Belgium) too, but it has a lot of controversy
07.01.24, 22:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, okay, cool
07.01.24, 22:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex also going home?
07.01.24, 22:15 - Niki: Yeah the one in Germany ask and works with the "old colonies"
07.01.24, 22:15 - Niki: Yup
07.01.24, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, sounds better
07.01.24, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Question
07.01.24, 22:16 - Niki: ?
07.01.24, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When you get here next month I thought it'd be nice to explore a different city, like Antwerp, Brussels or Brugge maybe, any preference?
07.01.24, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We could also go to the southern part of Belgium though, there's more nature there if you'd prefer that
07.01.24, 22:18 - Niki: Mmmmh not Brussels dont know about the south either. Really like the idea by the way will love to do that. Maybe Antwerp or brugge i dont know? <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
07.01.24, 22:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, sounds good, we can explore together then, I don't know either of those cities that well either 😊
07.01.24, 22:19 - Niki: Okay sounds lovely 😘
07.01.24, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can do both if you want as well, should have enough time for that 😘 (and then we don't have to choose)
07.01.24, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record I have been to both a bunch of times and the first person who tells me they got lost in Brugge is gonna get a side eye from me, so we won't get lost, but it just means there's a lot I haven't done yet (mostly in Antwerp)
07.01.24, 22:20 - Niki: Yeah don't know how much there is to do in the cities mabye ask your parents or some people?
07.01.24, 22:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If it's up to my dad we're going to the fancy vegan restaurant they went to yesterday 😅 in Antwerp they don't know a lot except for restaurants either, but I can ask Celine for some tips
07.01.24, 22:22 - Niki: Ah okas well we can do that then. Or mabye we do stuff you have allready done if there were that great?
07.01.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Brugge is pretty small so no need for that, it's just kinda a cute small city
07.01.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That was mostly shopping so wouldn't recommend
07.01.24, 22:22 - Niki: Sounds nice too
07.01.24, 22:23 - Niki: Ah okay you went shopping 😅 with who?
07.01.24, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Been a while but with a friend from high school, it was on a school trip and we had to explore the city by ourselves for the first part, then the second part of the day go to a WWII memorial museum
07.01.24, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also learned about the Red Starline, pretty interesting trip honestly, really liked that one
07.01.24, 22:25 - Niki: Ah okay mabye we can visit some museums or do some interactive stuff
07.01.24, 22:25 - Niki: Red starline?
07.01.24, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was a boating service for people going to the USA leaving from Antwerp
07.01.24, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can definitely do some museums, there's some really great ones
07.01.24, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: From before till during WWII
07.01.24, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think
07.01.24, 22:27 - Niki: So there is alot of dutch people in the USA or people who had ancestors from dutch?
07.01.24, 22:27 - Niki: Yeah need to swap trains now
07.01.24, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, a LOT moved there, but also just a lot of people from surrounding countries came through Antwerp to get there. It's still the second largest port in Europe for a reason
07.01.24, 22:30 - Niki: To be honest drugs is really the only thing I know about Antwerp
07.01.24, 22:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, so that's why you want to go to Antwerp 😂
07.01.24, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also have the largest diamond industry in Europe there (if I'm not mistaken) and a large Jewish community that is very involved with that diamond industry
07.01.24, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a pretty interesting city
07.01.24, 22:41 - Niki: Sounds like it
07.01.24, 22:44 - Niki: Found out my pattern first Portugal and now Antwerp
07.01.24, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Took me long enough damn
07.01.24, 22:45 - Niki: Really didn't think it would be in Belgium interesting. Well mabye there will be some museums about it?
07.01.24, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably yeah, I can look into it
07.01.24, 22:46 - Niki: No a must do to be honest just pop up
07.01.24, 22:46 - Niki: In my mind
07.01.24, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair, but I'll take a look at the museum's anyway
07.01.24, 22:46 - Niki: Can also do more romantically stuff
07.01.24, 22:46 - Niki: Okay 🥰
07.01.24, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Interesting
07.01.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any ideas for this? Just in general?
07.01.24, 22:48 - Niki: Not really we have a list right?
07.01.24, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, for dates, can look at that
07.01.24, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am gonna assume you don't want to go to the largest chocolate museum in the world? 😜
07.01.24, 22:52 - Niki: I would actually sounds nice.
07.01.24, 22:52 - Niki: Wanna see the umpalumpas too
07.01.24, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm afraid they might be a little shy
07.01.24, 23:01 - Niki: Oh mannn well atleast there will be a river of chocolate right?
07.01.24, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Perhaps
07.01.24, 23:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, they have a chocolate vault and organ, that good enough?
07.01.24, 23:16 - Niki: Wtf but yeah i geuss
07.01.24, 23:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the trip home going?
07.01.24, 23:18 - Niki: Need 40 more minutes but should be fine. Last train 🥳
07.01.24, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Last train is good, you must be tired traveling so much in the last 2 days
07.01.24, 23:21 - Niki: Yes i just wanna get home at this point and sleep🙏🏼
07.01.24, 23:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Totally get that
08.01.24, 00:21 - Niki: Finally home just done. I am going to sleep now outside its like minus 7 ° cold

08.01.24, 18:30 - Niki: Love you too 💜
08.01.24, 20:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
08.01.24, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
08.01.24, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The dumbarse
08.01.24, 20:27 - Niki: But he still likes it which is really nice
08.01.24, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: that's true
08.01.24, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Made biscuits for almost 5 minutes
08.01.24, 20:38 - Niki: Also i binged the show in the back ground on my train ride 😅
08.01.24, 20:38 - Niki: Yes 100% sometimes
08.01.24, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was a good show? Am not really watching it, but my parents are and it looks quite nice as far as I've seen
08.01.24, 21:20 - Niki: Its okay. The ending is meh but the comedy is good over all I think
08.01.24, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair
08.01.24, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Matches with what I've seen too
08.01.24, 22:21 - Niki: Hope you're still having a good evening?
08.01.24, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, having a good time, learning HTML as a break from studying, pretty cool and not that difficult as I was afraid
08.01.24, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your evening going hon?
08.01.24, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Any reason why you're asking it this way?
08.01.24, 22:31 - Niki: Learning HTML crazy?
How far are you?
08.01.24, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I'm using freeCodeCamp, making a website with HTML and CSS
08.01.24, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
08.01.24, 22:32 - Niki: Nice playing games with Alex
08.01.24, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds nice
08.01.24, 22:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What games?
08.01.24, 22:36 - Niki: Overwatch
08.01.24, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sometimes I wonder why I ask because that is the answer 90% of the time 😂
08.01.24, 22:46 - Niki: Or lol / indie games
08.01.24, 22:46 - Niki: Nope why?
08.01.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, true, but whenever I ask what you're playing with Alex, Overwatch seems to be the case 90% of the time, idk why
08.01.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, just reading too much into it again, dw
08.01.24, 22:47 - Niki: Kinda nice to see you learn HTML. But does it relax you or get you off studying the subject for tests?
08.01.24, 22:47 - Niki: True
08.01.24, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyone else sending this I would think they expect more of an answer then they got before and that's what they're asking for in a roundabout way, that's why I think I was overreading it 😅
08.01.24, 22:48 - Niki: Okay what did you read into it?
08.01.24, 22:48 - Niki: Ah okay yeah not that complex
08.01.24, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The problem is that it is actually too interesting right now, I'm liking this a lot more than studying statistics 😅 so yeah, definitely gets my mind off studying, but a bit too much so
08.01.24, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, I should remind myself of that when talking to you 😅 talking to you is much easier than anyone else, which someone makes me realise how much I overanalyse most people talking to me
08.01.24, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's refreshing
08.01.24, 22:53 - Niki: Thanks i geuss 😅
08.01.24, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is a compliment
08.01.24, 23:00 - Niki: Thanks hon 😘
08.01.24, 23:02 - Niki: Thought so because well its really nice but it also gets complicated once you actually need to get it pretty and reliable on everything
08.01.24, 23:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, not there yet, but so far it's really nice :)
09.01.24, 00:37 - Niki: I duck up my doulingo streak 🥲
09.01.24, 00:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh honey
09.01.24, 00:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't tell me it's back to 0
09.01.24, 00:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Shit happens though
09.01.24, 00:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Especially when you're busy
09.01.24, 01:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
09.01.24, 01:45 - Niki: Yes it is ups 😅

10.01.24, 01:21 - Niki: No helping in that i geuss
10.01.24, 01:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, we talked about Elias's rings and now I only get ring advertisements on Instagram
10.01.24, 01:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, the only thing that usually helps is listening to music but I don't want to go down to get my headphones
10.01.24, 01:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice rings though, gotta say
10.01.24, 01:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How come you can't sleep?
10.01.24, 01:24 - Niki: Oh nice. Well we can still gets some with out the attached of getting married. But you don't like to weat them
10.01.24, 01:25 - Niki: Just not sleeping don't know
10.01.24, 01:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
10.01.24, 01:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, idk, they're pretty expensive too and while I would wear it around my neck on a chain, I feel like people would be quick to ask questions
10.01.24, 01:26 - Niki: Yup definitely all sorts. But yeah they do be expensive.
10.01.24, 01:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would like something that is a bit more permanent than our hair ties though, whatever that may be. I get worried it will rip or something 😅
10.01.24, 01:27 - Niki: Love you hon ❤️
10.01.24, 01:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too ❤️
10.01.24, 01:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record
10.01.24, 01:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When I say I want something like this, I don't mean for me, I mean for both of us
10.01.24, 01:28 - Niki: Yeah also afraid of them ripping. But it will happen. Geuss we will find something
10.01.24, 01:28 - Niki: Yes i thought so too
10.01.24, 01:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've been looking for something for you but it's hard for me to tell what you'd like or dislike
10.01.24, 01:29 - Niki: Like you dislike not being near you
10.01.24, 01:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That was very smooth
10.01.24, 01:29 - Niki: Mabye when i am over there next month we can look together ❤️
10.01.24, 01:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Swooning for sure

10.01.24, 01:30 - Niki: Glad to hear that.
10.01.24, 01:31 - Niki: Mabye a late first yeqr together present for the two of us for each other 🥰
10.01.24, 01:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would say I just want a permanent reminder of you but that sounds too much like a kid in my mind
10.01.24, 01:31 - Niki: I thought of a tattoo but yeah kid too
10.01.24, 01:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That sounds really nice and I think it would be a nice way to celebrate that yeah 🥰
10.01.24, 01:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was gonna say you can laser a tattoo off but you can technically kill a kid too, so maybe not that permanent after all <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
10.01.24, 01:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But perhaps a little bit morbid
10.01.24, 01:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Whoops
10.01.24, 01:32 - Niki: Jesus that got dark fast but yeah i agree
10.01.24, 01:33 - Niki: Love the sense of humor😅

10.01.24, 01:35 - Niki: Getting abit too late

10.01.24, 18:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going alright, relaxing a bit now
10.01.24, 18:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How were classes?
10.01.24, 18:57 - Niki: Okay talk to the prof about the exam and its pretty chill. He is a good person i would say
10.01.24, 18:57 - Niki: Important for the brain.
10.01.24, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's nice
10.01.24, 19:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope the exam is equally chill then
10.01.24, 19:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Trying to convince Alex to go to a fucking dentist is difficult as fuck goddamn
10.01.24, 19:05 - Niki: ? huh what happend ? I also got a date for a check up
10.01.24, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank god you're reasonable
10.01.24, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no
10.01.24, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not just reasonable
10.01.24, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wonderful
10.01.24, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And independent
10.01.24, 19:06 - Niki: cutiie ❤️
10.01.24, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex has to get a root canal done or something, has been in pain for literal months and somehow can't talk to her parents about it, because it does cost quite a lot and also because somehow Alex is practically immune to sedatives and is terrified to go to the dentist
10.01.24, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I literally have to make an appointment and go with her because otherwise she might just not go at all
10.01.24, 19:08 - Niki: huh wtf ?
10.01.24, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also to get her to go to a doctor to talk about the issue with pain killers... Should be in medical records in case she ever needs surgery but somehow doesn't believe that's something important??
10.01.24, 19:09 - Niki: Sucks that she is immune but it can be really dangours if she does get ti done
10.01.24, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's why I'm saying to go to specialist to talk about it, so it's in the medical record
10.01.24, 19:11 - Niki: its not on there yet
10.01.24, 19:12 - Niki: They drilled one time with out sedatives and iit was hell would never do iit again
10.01.24, 19:12 - Niki: but woman are more pain resisten i think
10.01.24, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, because she's never talked to any doctor about it
10.01.24, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, totally get that
10.01.24, 19:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is partially a myth but it's mostly because we're more used to it so our pain levels to showing pain are higher
10.01.24, 19:16 - Niki: Yeah mean it that way
10.01.24, 19:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I guess that's true
10.01.24, 19:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Especially if you're asking a tattoo artist 😅
10.01.24, 20:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Whatcha up to tonight?

10.01.24, 20:13 - Niki: no not really
10.01.24, 20:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You just want to chill, watch your show and not talk to me? Just so we're seeing eye-to-eye
10.01.24, 20:16 - Niki: No sorry didnt mean it that way. Alex just came back from the hairdresser and i talk with him but also didnt want to let you wait
10.01.24, 20:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't mean that in an accusing way if it came across like that, just wondering
10.01.24, 20:17 - Niki: ah okay
10.01.24, 20:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: His hair look good? Chat to him, I can wait :))
10.01.24, 20:18 - Niki: Okay yeah no we did talk also not for that long.

10.01.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's pretty cool
10.01.24, 20:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It might not be as complicated as I thought at the beginning after all
10.01.24, 20:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But you were definitely right, making it look nice is the annoying part
10.01.24, 20:36 - Niki: Yeah ❤️ it is
10.01.24, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just happy I'm learning the basics, I have absolutely no clue of the kind of bullshit you needed to deal with to make the website for your business 😭🥲
10.01.24, 20:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, that's up and running right?
10.01.24, 20:39 - Niki: Yeah the begiin is more typing than thiinking. So much repetitive
10.01.24, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can definitely believe that yeah
10.01.24, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My parents were asking about the website during the weekend but I don't have the link

10.01.24, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can I see? I'm curious what you think is ugly af

10.01.24, 20:43 - Niki: nah iits not trust me
10.01.24, 20:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although I do have to say FutureSAX is kinda hidden in between yall
10.01.24, 20:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am very curious to see what it will look like when it's actually finished then, you're giving me high expectations you know?
10.01.24, 20:44 - Niki: Yeah well its our party
10.01.24, 20:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: party?

11.01.24, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No appointment made yet
11.01.24, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dealing with it by distracting herself, so talking to me I guess
11.01.24, 00:27 - Niki: Not good but you know that
11.01.24, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She has already taken the max amount of painkillers so yeah
11.01.24, 00:27 - Niki: Also not a lasting solution
11.01.24, 00:27 - Niki: Also not good
11.01.24, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope she goes to a doctor tomorrow at least, and makes that fucking dentist appointment
11.01.24, 00:28 - Niki: Well yeah need to start somewhere
11.01.24, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She said she will but yeah, we'll see

11.01.24, 01:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's so stupid how much I miss you after only a couple of days

11.01.24, 10:50 - Niki: good morning rabbit hope you have the same ❤️
11.01.24, 11:18 - Niki: Also to this and the other text i 10000% agree its weird how it just hits like a bomb. Its really hard sometimes
11.01.24, 12:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it is
11.01.24, 17:06 - Niki: Done with university for today or atleast i am back home. How is your day going my love ❤️?
11.01.24, 17:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's going alright I guess, could be worse. How was uni? ❤️
11.01.24, 17:09 - Niki: Pretty good more about the exams and talk with my group
11.01.24, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's the boardgame project going? That has to be done soon?

11.01.24, 17:18 - Niki: Will send you some pictures when its done🥰
11.01.24, 17:18 - Niki: By the way did alex do something about her tooth?
11.01.24, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's going to the doctor tomorrow and she's also gonna talk to her dad then about the dentist appointment
11.01.24, 17:22 - Niki: Good to hear 👍🏻
11.01.24, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yesterday evening I practically looked up all the basic things she needs to know so that's at least 1 barrier out of the way, also probably will go with her to the dentist appointment but we'll see about that
11.01.24, 17:25 - Niki: Yeah you are her parent figure for sure but that all sounds like a good plan.
11.01.24, 17:26 - Niki: By the way date night any idea how we're going to do that tonight? Or you still wanna decide later
11.01.24, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhhh, I know I am, I'm kind of the mom friend very often 😅
11.01.24, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can do study date I guess, but I also want that to be chill, and not the whole time? Like we study together for an hour or so and then just relax?
11.01.24, 17:37 - Niki: Okay we could also move it or drop it if you wanna to?
11.01.24, 17:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, definitely don't want to do that
11.01.24, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Otherwise if we're following that logic we shouldn't call for another 2-3 weeks
11.01.24, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
11.01.24, 18:28 - Niki: Not necessarily but i understand your reasoning. So around 20:00 studynight / relaxing?

12.01.24, 01:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Some days I think it's unfair and unreasonable how much I love you and how I am looking forward to a future with you. It feels unfair because somehow this feeling overwhelms me and I don't know what to do with it other than hope that it will be just as nice as I can imagine. It feels unreasonable because how can I love one person so much? How can I crave your love, attention and presence in my life like no one else's before you? 
Anyway, the point of this is that I love loving you unreasonable amounts because you're you and that's just how I feel. Like you deserve all the love I have to give and then some more
12.01.24, 09:20 - Niki: Love you too and waking up to these kinds of text. I cant wait fot the future too ❤️
12.01.24, 09:20 - Niki: ps You are amazing ❤️ and i wanna give you a my love too

12.01.24, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going meh, still have a lot to do.
Not escaping the bromance accusations with Marco hon, just saying 😉
12.01.24, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was tutoring?
12.01.24, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't know why that is but yeah, I noticed

12.01.24, 17:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: SO they just do some studying and ask you a question when they're stuck? Sounds pretty chill yeah, hope you still get to do some studying too though
12.01.24, 17:06 - Niki: Yeah mostly because i dont wanna give you a opportunity to procrastinated. Or distract you. Which i know you still want to text but I don't know why i feel like that
12.01.24, 17:06 - Niki: Yup 100% on point and at the ende we go through it again and answer any questions
12.01.24, 17:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You do realise that you are not my main source of procrastination right?
12.01.24, 17:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not even by far close to it actually 😅
12.01.24, 17:07 - Niki: How is or what is?
12.01.24, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like that works really well, would try the same if I knew anyone in my classes who would want to do that
12.01.24, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The wonderful world wide web of course

14.01.24, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a little bit funny how ever since we have the new kitchen, my mom keeps offering to help my dad cook. Every time he does not seem to want that though 😅😂
14.01.24, 19:17 - Niki: Your mom is nice and sorry for your dad 😅
14.01.24, 19:17 - Niki: I am sorry for him in that context
14.01.24, 19:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think she doesn't realise he likes cooking by himself somehow 😅

16.01.24, 09:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a nightmare again 😅
16.01.24, 11:46 - Niki: What was it about?
16.01.24, 11:46 - Niki: Nope but feel okay with the energy I have 😅
16.01.24, 11:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What time did you go to sleep? I'm just curious
16.01.24, 11:47 - Niki: 2/3 or something like that
16.01.24, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uh... We were planning a family trip, then my dad got a motorbike and I was borrowing it. While I was driving back from a carnival I had to stop at a red light, a guy on a motorcycle then stopped next to me, wanted to race, I said I didn't feel comfortable with that, he taunted me but in the end somehow was talking to me the whole ride, then we decided to stop at a small grocery store, he was kind of giving me the creeps though, he "joked" about stealing some thing, I waited outside, trying to figure a way to lose him. He then robbed the grocery store and killed the security guards, while I was trying to escape
16.01.24, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn hon, that's not exactly early is it?
16.01.24, 11:51 - Niki: Damm what the fuck? Your dreams are crazy. But bike riding seems nice would ride with you 😘
16.01.24, 11:52 - Niki: Nope its like 5/4 hours of sleep not good for me.
16.01.24, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would like to learn how to ride one at some point yeah, but the killer part was a bit scary, especially because he yelled after me al bloodied
16.01.24, 11:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey... please take good care of yourself
16.01.24, 11:53 - Niki: Trying to 😅
16.01.24, 11:58 - Niki: Man your nightmare are really fucking horrific
16.01.24, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh
16.01.24, 11:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What can I say?
16.01.24, 11:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is what it is?
16.01.24, 12:03 - Niki: Yeah i know still love you and will hold you if you wake up in a panic 😊
16.01.24, 12:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have a surprisingly easy time falling back asleep after waking up from them though, it's kinda weird. But having you there would always be better 😘 (though I also think the chances of me having a nightmare when we're sleeping together are a lot smaller)
16.01.24, 12:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love ❤
16.01.24, 20:26 - Niki: Kinda disappointed that you didn't know it was me text with you over Alex phone
16.01.24, 20:26 - Niki: But still how was your day hon?
16.01.24, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't know? Did you even read my last text?
16.01.24, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But no, I don't have the ability to straight up see what is going on on the other side of a phone screen
16.01.24, 20:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Day was okay, studying :/

16.01.24, 20:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What was the business meeting for? Alex accidentally sent me the mentimeter
16.01.24, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds busy
16.01.24, 20:34 - Niki: It was like a meet up from a group of people how help start ups. Kinda hard to explain

17.01.24, 19:09 - Niki: I am just happy you like and use the gift ❤️
17.01.24, 19:10 - Niki: Glad to hear that. Makes me happy 🥰
17.01.24, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do, I love it 🥰
17.01.24, 19:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
17.01.24, 19:10 - Niki: You too cupcake ❤️

17.01.24, 19:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What a coincidence 😘
17.01.24, 19:12 - Niki: Also Princes dianna is such a nice person in the show. But also really fucking tragic
17.01.24, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you like the candle and it gives you a little motivation
17.01.24, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, very true
17.01.24, 19:12 - Niki: it does because i need to let it burn to the corners to get full use of it
17.01.24, 19:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, tried that but didn't work for me, I hope it works for you though! 🙏🍀
17.01.24, 19:15 - Niki: it works
17.01.24, 19:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn really?? It's burning to the corners??
17.01.24, 19:19 - Niki: Not fully
17.01.24, 19:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, okay, that makes more sense
17.01.24, 23:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope your night is going well hon
17.01.24, 23:47 - Niki: Yeah had a meeting with my group and studyed abit now back to minecraft.
17.01.24, 23:47 - Niki: How is your night going ?
17.01.24, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was good, my dad decided on a castle for his birthday party and we ordered Indian with my aunt and Pieter
17.01.24, 23:48 - Niki: oH crazy which castle is it ?
17.01.24, 23:48 - Niki: Nice hope the indian was good? <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
17.01.24, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: God, I have no clue, just know that it's a 2.5h drive and in France
17.01.24, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, was from the restaurant we went with my parents
17.01.24, 23:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But the castle apparently fits 50 people or something, it's crazy
17.01.24, 23:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man is going all out
17.01.24, 23:54 - Niki: Damm man its gonna be crazy
17.01.24, 23:55 - Niki: But its not gonna be 50 people
17.01.24, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I guess, no clue what we're gonna do there but at least we'll have a goddamn castle with indoor pool, 11 minutes from a cathedral
17.01.24, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably not, more like 20-26 depending if my mom invites some people too
17.01.24, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And if everyone is free that weekend
18.01.24, 00:25 - Niki: Man thats the most hypt up party i have go to then
18.01.24, 00:25 - Niki: Ah okay that's actually less then i thought
18.01.24, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still kind of figuring it out who is invited and all that
18.01.24, 00:27 - Niki: ah okay will be interesed in the people that come
18.01.24, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, you're part of the family so obviously you're invited, but you have exams really short after that so I get it if you don't
18.01.24, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, probably a bunch of people I haven't seen in a while too, but most people you should know I think? really have to figure out who is coming...
18.01.24, 00:28 - Niki: Will see but i think it will be there for sure
18.01.24, 00:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, but just so you know, if you decide the day beforehand you have to study, you can still cancel okay?
18.01.24, 00:37 - Niki: Okay will do
18.01.24, 00:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna go to sleep now though
18.01.24, 00:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤
18.01.24, 00:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun on Minecraft 😘
18.01.24, 01:01 - Niki: thanks now going to bed now
18.01.24, 01:01 - Niki: Goodnight hon ❤️
18.01.24, 10:29 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
18.01.24, 11:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon ❤️
18.01.24, 11:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am so fucking jealous of the snow 🥲
18.01.24, 13:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
18.01.24, 19:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll be 5 minutes late, sorry 😅
18.01.24, 20:00 - Niki: its okay
18.01.24, 20:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm ready
18.01.24, 20:04 - Niki: null
18.01.24, 21:40 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
18.01.24, 21:40 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
18.01.24, 22:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why are you always the first to hang up?
18.01.24, 22:01 - Niki: I don't know why i just get tired. Not of you but with you if that makes sense?
18.01.24, 22:02 - Niki: Sorry i can try to call longer but i just get tired.
18.01.24, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would hope not of me, then what would be the point?
18.01.24, 22:03 - Niki: Not of you 😂. Jesus that would be weird
18.01.24, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, I know you get tired, I'm just sad and I miss you and I always hate hanging up, but especially on Thursdays after I feel like we for some reason were just doing different things while we were calling
18.01.24, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, would be very weird indeed
18.01.24, 22:04 - Niki: Yeah get that would also like to call you again but tonight i am just to tired and this month is just bad over all with the exams and all.
18.01.24, 22:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, you don't have to tell me about exams, I know what that's like
18.01.24, 22:05 - Niki: I love you and miss you too like crazy. I hope you know that.
18.01.24, 22:08 - Niki: By the way i got the same feeling with were not doing something together tonight or both doing something else. It felt abit weird i dont know why. Dont know if you also felt so?
18.01.24, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do know that, but sometimes it's just easy to look at other things that seem to indicate the opposite, easier than ever when I'm stressed out of my mind and just in general not in a great state of mind. I just miss you a shitload and idk, I'm just looking at the wrong things making it worse
18.01.24, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I did feel that way, but I also didn't want you to not be up to date on what was happening with your project so I just decided to do something else because you were busy and not really talking to me. Idk what else we could have done though
18.01.24, 22:09 - Niki: Yeah feel that mabye we need to try to find something that relaxes us both and we like and we could do together?
18.01.24, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, sounds good, but any idea what that could be?
18.01.24, 22:11 - Niki: Yeah sorry about that just talk to me at that point. Please remind me or something i don't wanna make you feel left out.
You can also start a conversation and i will more likely talk to you as reading the message <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
18.01.24, 22:11 - Niki: Dnd haha
Mabye games
Or some coding stuff
Mabye reading
Or puzzles?
18.01.24, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, just don't want you to fall behind in school either, which is why I said at some point we can also call another time
18.01.24, 22:13 - Niki: Yeah but another time is hard to find right now
18.01.24, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dnd is coming back after the exams hopefully, games could be I guess, if you're willing to put up with my noob-ness.
18.01.24, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: for school or for me?
18.01.24, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Coding stuff I'm still shit at so maybe in the future.
Reading, depends if we can read the same books could be nice but I also feel like we can't call that often and to then just read together would be a bit of a waste of time the? Idk? Could read a book in our spare time and talk about it though.
What kind of puzzles? Crosswords? Sudokus? Or piece puzzles?
18.01.24, 22:17 - Niki: For you because we still have different lives but i wanna find time with you
18.01.24, 22:18 - Niki: Puzzle some i don't know?
Book sounds great like a small book club 😘
Code okay future.
Video game i love you noob-ass🥰
18.01.24, 22:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I want to find time with you too, but because we have so little time together I want it to be just us, if that makes sense? No checking emails or talking to other people unless it's urgent (obviously) because right now it's a bit too big of a whiplash every time we are together and then when we're not. When we're together I feel like we're focussing pretty much only on each other and when we're apart it feels like the opposite is happening and I don't like that
18.01.24, 22:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I said noob-ness, not noob-ass 🥹🥲
18.01.24, 22:21 - Niki: But i like you being a noob and your ass 😘
18.01.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess I have nothing to say about that then
18.01.24, 22:24 - Niki: Yeah get that will try to focus on not getting distracted. But i hope you can help me with that. So if you see me distract say something please. I don't wanna make you feel bad because of me ❤️
18.01.24, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I'll try, but you have to do the same for me then; deal? ❤️
18.01.24, 22:25 - Niki: Deal 😘
18.01.24, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: love you too btw 😘
18.01.24, 22:27 - Niki: Thought you forgot 😅
18.01.24, 22:27 - Niki: Goodnight hon ❤️
sweet dreams 😘
18.01.24, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What did you eat?
18.01.24, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I got distracted but I didn't forget 😅❤️
18.01.24, 22:28 - Niki: Rice pouring
18.01.24, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure, fantastic dinner
18.01.24, 22:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or well, you ate at 17, guess it's just very late dessert
18.01.24, 22:29 - Niki: Nope its still dinner 😅 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
18.01.24, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤ Hope to see you in dreamland
18.01.24, 22:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: … I was trying to make it sound better, why would you ruin this?
19.01.24, 10:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning 🌄
19.01.24, 10:18 - Niki: Good morning my love 😘
19.01.24, 10:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
19.01.24, 10:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I somehow got into a discord group of people in LDRs and it is... Interesting to say the least how quickly I got roped into the dramatics
19.01.24, 10:36 - Niki: Yeah what's up with the group?
19.01.24, 10:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's a girl from India who has a boyfriend but she had to leave for 7 months for school, so they're doing LDR, but when she was gone he got a "girl bestie" (this is how she calls it) and she's afraid because now she has to go non-contact for a month for school that he will get with her instead
19.01.24, 10:44 - Niki: Yeah drama 🫣. Well if he cheats its over.
19.01.24, 10:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The guy is suspicious though, he fully changed the story from how he met the girl a bunch of times, then suddenly said he blocked her on all platforms when his gf asked more about it
19.01.24, 10:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like... If there's nothing going on, why would you block the girl??
19.01.24, 10:45 - Niki: I don't know why. He is probably lying
19.01.24, 10:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's what we're thinking too
19.01.24, 10:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But girl... Jesus, she now wants to find the other girl but her only info is that they play GTA V together 😭
19.01.24, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Girl please... She told him she has to go non-contact (she really doesn't want to do that but is forced by her parents) and he fucking cursed at her... And now she's saying he definitely isn't a sweet guy... I swear to god I don't even know how old these people are but goddamn
19.01.24, 10:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just found out there's a 5 year age gap and Yuna (the gf) is 15... I can't
19.01.24, 10:56 - Niki: Wtf its getting more and more fuck up
19.01.24, 10:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
19.01.24, 10:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why is everyone younger than me 😭
19.01.24, 10:58 - Niki: What should I say?
19.01.24, 10:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I'm just disturbed these are all teenagers 😅
19.01.24, 11:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Someone is 22!!! Eureka!!
19.01.24, 11:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Right now there's 2 people I like in this discord, Anastasia (22 and socially awkward like me) and Dragomir (18, non-binary and done with Yuna's bf)
19.01.24, 11:06 - Niki: Nice to find some good people
19.01.24, 11:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, we'll see
19.01.24, 11:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, Yunah... This child... Doesn't have any friends or family she can rely on, only her bf... And you're telling me he got together with her when she was 14... This is textbook grooming 😭
19.01.24, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But how do you say that to a stranger who is 15?? And explain that one without having her lash out 😭
19.01.24, 11:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank the Lord for Drahomyr
19.01.24, 11:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Told her to research grooming, very good
19.01.24, 11:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She doesn't know his name 😭😭😭
19.01.24, 11:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What the fuck is this shit 😭
19.01.24, 11:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This poor kid, a bunch of internet strangers are staging an intervention 😭
19.01.24, 11:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, this is... Deep, apparently Drahomyr was groomed when they were younger 😭
19.01.24, 11:26 - Niki: Damm sounds like a horror scenario. Hope she gets some help. The internet helps again
19.01.24, 11:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man... She's not having it
19.01.24, 11:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just said that he's not a groomer.
19.01.24, 11:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Children
19.01.24, 12:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think I underestimated how bad LDR relationships can be goddamn
19.01.24, 12:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We have moved on to another girl who has been in a relationship for only a month, but the guy blocks her when she wants to talk about communication, doesn't respond to her love you's and just straight up ignores her for days… I swear to god
19.01.24, 12:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Drahomyr is slowly becoming a very good friend
19.01.24, 12:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Is this the only lesbian in the groupchat? As far as I'm aware yes, this is a total coincidence
19.01.24, 12:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also gave me a good recommendation for a Swedish band
19.01.24, 12:35 - Niki: Nice is it all over discord?
19.01.24, 12:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
19.01.24, 12:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sorry if I'm spamming you btw
19.01.24, 12:41 - Niki: Nah like to know what you up to. Also interested in other LDR
19.01.24, 12:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You just like the drama, I see 😂😘
19.01.24, 13:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: People just freaking out over what time it is and that their partner hasn't sent a message yet 😭
19.01.24, 13:11 - Niki: Damm i mean yeah but still relax i don't know
19.01.24, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, some are making fun of it now, it's pretty funnt
19.01.24, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *funny
19.01.24, 13:22 - Niki: Really seems kinda weird to me making fun of people that are in the same situaton as one self
19.01.24, 13:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh, some people are kind of savage on this one
19.01.24, 13:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Talking about age gaps… man, people are... in interesting relationships
19.01.24, 13:26 - Niki: Really tell me more ?
19.01.24, 13:26 - Niki: more then 10 years
19.01.24, 13:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, but like 17 and 26 so close to it and a minor
19.01.24, 13:27 - Niki: Yeah minors are allways weird in a relationship
19.01.24, 13:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yuppp
19.01.24, 13:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I should be studying 😭
19.01.24, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty sure the Yunah girl hates me :)))))
19.01.24, 17:15 - Niki: Why what happend ?
19.01.24, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is fucking funny
19.01.24, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I agreed with her that Drahomyr sometimes sounds like a bot and the girl is annoyed with me that Draho responded to me
19.01.24, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And not her
19.01.24, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jesus
19.01.24, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So stupid
19.01.24, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also may have found a teacher for Ukrainian/Russian
19.01.24, 17:26 - Niki: yeah bots are weird and every where. But nice findiing new people
19.01.24, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah no, Draho isn't a bot, just kind of writes messages like one sometimes for some reason
19.01.24, 17:27 - Niki: Oh okay nevermind then
19.01.24, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going hon?
19.01.24, 17:29 - Niki: Alright kinda procrastinating
19.01.24, 17:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (for the record I have not just been on discord all day, I have studied)
19.01.24, 17:29 - Niki: Ah so we are the same
19.01.24, 17:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: As usual honestly
19.01.24, 18:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you're having a lovely day hon ❤
19.01.24, 18:12 - Niki: Yeah my evening is nice. Hope yours is great too?
19.01.24, 18:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, just studying so okay
19.01.24, 18:26 - Niki: Good luck with that hon 😘
19.01.24, 18:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love ❤
19.01.24, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to tonight?
19.01.24, 19:11 - Niki: Studying and playing some games. Mabye watching the crown. Right now making dinner
19.01.24, 19:12 - Niki: Wanna do something together? (call?)
19.01.24, 19:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No matter how much I would love to, I really still have to study 😭
19.01.24, 19:13 - Niki: Okay good decision 😘
19.01.24, 19:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Unless you just want to call while we both do our thing, idk
19.01.24, 19:13 - Niki: Dont think its gonna work. I will distract you for sure 😅
19.01.24, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, you think that but it can't be worse than right now when I'm being distracted by anything else
19.01.24, 19:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I get if you feel uncomfortable with that though
19.01.24, 19:16 - Niki: Yeah dont wanna be the reason to be honest 🥲.
19.01.24, 19:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't want to be the reason i'm distracted?
19.01.24, 19:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite frankly, I was much better at studying when you were here than I am now
19.01.24, 19:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If that in any way soothes your worries about being a distraction
19.01.24, 19:20 - Niki: Yes
19.01.24, 19:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair, I definitely get that
19.01.24, 19:21 - Niki: Well yeah but we were still be close together 🥲
19.01.24, 19:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And you don't think that would have made me being distracted worse? When you're sitting right beside me and I can do anything I want without having to go 800km? Really hon? I had a lot of self restraint to actually study back then instead of trying to distract you with kisses the whole time
19.01.24, 19:23 - Niki: Cutie 🥰 made me blush hardly
19.01.24, 19:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Says the cutie 😘
19.01.24, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I'm guessing that's still a no on the call?
19.01.24, 19:29 - Niki: Mhhhh
19.01.24, 19:29 - Niki: We can but i will be sceptical
19.01.24, 19:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair
19.01.24, 19:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We don't have to
19.01.24, 19:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: i'm just trying my luck here so I can see your cute face again :))
19.01.24, 19:30 - Niki: ah cutiiiiiiiiie
19.01.24, 19:31 - Niki: I would be ready to call
19.01.24, 19:31 - Niki: Ready to call 😅
19.01.24, 19:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am not, my mom came in and is doing some work now...

19.01.24, 23:59 - Niki: Cant sleep 😐
19.01.24, 23:59 - Niki: Yeah same 🥰
19.01.24, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How come?
19.01.24, 23:59 - Niki: Dont know
19.01.24, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anything I can do to help?
20.01.24, 00:00 - Niki: How you would help?
20.01.24, 00:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, we can talk a bit, we could call, you always get tired after that 😭😅
20.01.24, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I could sing you a lullaby (though I would have to look one up honestly)
20.01.24, 00:01 - Niki: Na i also want xou to sleep
20.01.24, 00:01 - Niki: That i would love to hear
20.01.24, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let's not lie about this, my sleeping schedule is way too fucked up for me to be able to sleep now anyway
20.01.24, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay I just looked up the lyrics of one of the lullabies I thought my parents would sing to me
20.01.24, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And... I think they changed the lyrics because damn, the lyrics are literally "you're mother and father are monkeys"
20.01.24, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can't do it, I'm sorry, I don't like how I sound at all 😅
20.01.24, 00:08 - Niki: Okay i will try to sleep again
20.01.24, 00:09 - Niki: With out a lullaby 🥲
20.01.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't guilt trip me please 😭
20.01.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I want to
20.01.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I sound really fucking bad
20.01.24, 00:09 - Niki: Okay its fine trust me 😘
20.01.24, 00:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you say so
20.01.24, 00:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I wish I could do more for you. Not just now, in general
20.01.24, 00:11 - Niki: Huh what you mean? In what way?
20.01.24, 00:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just like, in general I wish I could be there for you more, because I can give you kind words and reassurance but I can't physically be with you and just, idk, support you in general. It's maybe weird to think this about something like falling asleep, but still
20.01.24, 00:14 - Niki: No i get what you mean. It's like a part is missing and i also want it to be there.
20.01.24, 00:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, exactly
20.01.24, 00:15 - Niki: Love you hon ❤️
20.01.24, 00:15 - Niki: Can't wait to see you again

20.01.24, 00:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't wait either 🥰
20.01.24, 00:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still can't sleep?
20.01.24, 00:49 - Niki: Nope not yet but i have  accepted it and laying down
20.01.24, 00:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean... Laying down should be the first step to falling asleep I think?
20.01.24, 00:50 - Niki: But like eyes closed and not trying to look at my phone every 5min if i cant sleep yet
20.01.24, 00:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, that is smart, then please continue 😘
20.01.24, 00:51 - Niki: Thx hope you fall asleep first though 😘
20.01.24, 00:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no, I hope we fall asleep at the same time and then end up in each other's dreams 😘
20.01.24, 00:52 - Niki: Your right cutie like that one more 😘

22.01.24, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I can't stand the presentators 😅
22.01.24, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
22.01.24, 20:57 - Niki: Eating and playing some games.
22.01.24, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds fun
22.01.24, 20:58 - Niki: Damm really i also did that with my parents alot its was really nice
22.01.24, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The renovations themselves are great, really cool how they innovate everything, but the people doing it are really cringeworthy in a bad way
22.01.24, 21:00 - Niki: Damm the hate is real i see xD
22.01.24, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
22.01.24, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Big dislike
22.01.24, 21:02 - Niki: Heard anything new form celine or Jinte/Alex?
22.01.24, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah
22.01.24, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely
22.01.24, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex gave me a major life update today
22.01.24, 21:03 - Niki: ?
22.01.24, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Their exam went amazingly well today
22.01.24, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But also their motorbike got stolen
22.01.24, 21:03 - Niki: Huh what crazy
22.01.24, 21:03 - Niki: nice but damm did she lock it =
22.01.24, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And her mom might lose her child support because Alex might not be able to take enough classes next semester
22.01.24, 21:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I did not ask because I don't want the answer 😅
22.01.24, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte also had an exam today but didn't let me know how that went yet
22.01.24, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And Celine I only hear before an exam to wish each other luck
22.01.24, 21:07 - Niki: There is allways something going on in Alexs life its crazy. Also the child support kinda sucks.
22.01.24, 21:07 - Niki: Jinte is kinda quit lately ?
22.01.24, 21:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but I think it should be fine, that shouldn't be too much of an issue I think
22.01.24, 21:08 - Niki: Celine probably studying to like crazy ?
22.01.24, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but always during exams. Gonna meet up after them for sure and talk about everything
22.01.24, 21:08 - Niki: Really but her bike ? just insurance ?
22.01.24, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably yeah, might see if we can grab a drink or something after our last exam
22.01.24, 21:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's going to the police tomorrow, I'm not sure what kind of insurance she has honestly
22.01.24, 21:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know what this is, but sometimes I have an instant feeling with people where I instantly dislike/distrust them and the person who just joined the chat gave me that feeling 🙃
22.01.24, 21:13 - Niki: Who is it ? Did they say/ write something ?
22.01.24, 21:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: xanabchaudhry#7918
22.01.24, 21:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, they entered saying they are fucked up and that their bf thinks they cheated
22.01.24, 21:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And then said they should leave
22.01.24, 21:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No more answer
22.01.24, 21:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know why I get this feeling sometimes
22.01.24, 21:15 - Niki: Okay weird yeah sounds fishy
22.01.24, 21:17 - Niki: by the way do we have a i dont like the person so we dont like them thing in our Relationship because i would be more than open for that xD
22.01.24, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I can only think of political figures 😂 I don't think so?? Do you have any?
22.01.24, 21:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm also totally open for that XD
22.01.24, 21:19 - Niki: Well the new person on dc?
Well we need to see in the future
22.01.24, 21:19 - Niki: Nice so its a deal
22.01.24, 21:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, not gonna judge that quickly but perhaps in the future yeah!
22.01.24, 21:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Should we seal the deal with a kiss? 🫣
22.01.24, 21:20 - Niki: Yeah please 🥰😘
22.01.24, 21:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 2 weeks and you'll get it 😘
22.01.24, 21:21 - Niki: Ah cutie cant wait
22.01.24, 21:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Me neither 🥰
22.01.24, 21:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently they found a bunch of exclusive oldtimers (Ferrari's, Porsches, etc) in a random warehouse in Brussels, all in bad state because someone left them behind
22.01.24, 21:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're being sold by an oldtimer merchant 5km from where my parents work 😅, my dad is interested 🙃
22.01.24, 21:26 - Niki: Sounds really nice
22.01.24, 21:26 - Niki: Keep me updated
22.01.24, 21:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will do, but I doubt there will be any actual updates on this one
22.01.24, 21:42 - Niki: ah sad
22.01.24, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For my dad perhaps, but no clue where we would put the thing, especially because it needs some extra love and care to bring it back to life
22.01.24, 21:43 - Niki: yeah for sure <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
22.01.24, 21:44 - Niki: Any source or webpage for it

22.01.24, 21:52 - Niki: No like it takes a long time to figure stuff out
22.01.24, 21:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I guess that's true
22.01.24, 21:55 - Niki: Also this is the place where they will be sold https://www.oldtimerfarm.be/en/home.php
22.01.24, 21:56 - Niki: i think

22.01.24, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But only from the 29th of January
22.01.24, 23:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's fixing your sleeping schedule going?
22.01.24, 23:26 - Niki: Bad
22.01.24, 23:26 - Niki: Really bad to ve honest
22.01.24, 23:27 - Niki: Playing with marco lol because its been a while since we talked and played
22.01.24, 23:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: "A while" last Wednesday 😂
22.01.24, 23:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun, but ya know, don't fuck it up again too much 😘
22.01.24, 23:28 - Niki: Yeah for us its been a while

22.01.24, 23:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just respecting your wishes 😘
22.01.24, 23:30 - Niki: To play lol yeah but games in general?
22.01.24, 23:31 - Niki: But right now its probably not a good idea to start a hobby like playing video games. Could get suck into it
22.01.24, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I told you before, I would like to play games, I just would never do so alone and I don't have experience so if you want to play with me you're gonna have to tell me what to do
22.01.24, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, that's true, maybe after the exams
22.01.24, 23:32 - Niki: Oh yeah well after exams we can start
22.01.24, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing
23.01.24, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna go to sleep, I have a killer headache

23.01.24, 00:56 - Niki: Going to bed now
23.01.24, 09:59 - Niki: Good morning my love 😘
23.01.24, 10:00 - Niki: Hope you had a great night or a weird as fuck nightmare? 😅🤭
23.01.24, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's not too bad
23.01.24, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon 😘
23.01.24, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not a great night but also no nightmares so quite alright
23.01.24, 10:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Dreamt about a really soft cat though
23.01.24, 10:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But the cat kinda hated me 🥲
23.01.24, 10:58 - Niki: aw really nice. oh nevermind
23.01.24, 10:58 - Niki: Sorry to hear that hon 🥲
23.01.24, 10:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also no clue what is going on with Alex because apparently the hotel they were sleeping in last night might have been on fire
23.01.24, 10:59 - Niki: huh what ?
23.01.24, 10:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know 😭
23.01.24, 11:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alex sent me a message at 4am that they were outside in the cold, not sure what was happening and there was a lot of smoke
23.01.24, 11:00 - Niki: okay man Alex is Always in the Center of chaos
23.01.24, 11:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't get any updates after that
23.01.24, 11:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely 😅
23.01.24, 11:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, in my dream with the cat I also dreamt we had a group chat with your Alex for some reason and we were going to Ireland
23.01.24, 11:01 - Niki: damm nice why not ireland sounds great
23.01.24, 11:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay so Instagram told me that it wasn't Alex's hotel that was on fire, but the building next to it... But they still had to leave the hotel for other reasons at 5am 😭 what the fuck even happened
23.01.24, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Reason ended up being that her mom missed her flight and she had to go pick her up from the airport
23.01.24, 15:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why that was at 4am, god only knows
23.01.24, 15:02 - Niki: Okay man she is living in a show its crazy
23.01.24, 15:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, why watch tv when I can just talk to Alex?
23.01.24, 15:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you muffin
23.01.24, 15:05 - Niki: Miss you too cupcake
23.01.24, 15:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just want to hug you and kiss you and I really dislike that I can't
23.01.24, 15:09 - Niki: Yeah same ❤️
23.01.24, 15:13 - Niki: Also the discord group is helping with that or the contraire. For me it doesnt tbh
23.01.24, 15:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: what do you mean?
23.01.24, 15:19 - Niki: Does the it help with the missing me feeling ?
23.01.24, 15:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah
23.01.24, 15:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not sure it does anything to that feeling honestly
23.01.24, 15:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It has made me realise how lucky we are that we're not THAT far apart
23.01.24, 15:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But other than that it doesn't do much for the way I feel because that is based in my feelings for you, which are not at all changing because I'm suddenly talking about relationships with random people
23.01.24, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you equal amounts as before this, it just made me realise that every relationship is different and I'm quite happy and lucky with ours (even if LDR still sucks ass of course)
23.01.24, 15:22 - Niki: okay yeah it makes me remember sounds kinda shitty but it shows the distance.
23.01.24, 15:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's very fair, I get why you feel that way
23.01.24, 15:23 - Niki: Also happy about the distance a bit more
23.01.24, 15:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhh, yeah
23.01.24, 15:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sometimes I feel happy it's not that far, but in general I still despise it
23.01.24, 15:25 - Niki: Else how is your day going hon ?
23.01.24, 15:25 - Niki: yes 100%
23.01.24, 15:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay ish, I don't feel great which is reflecting in how well I'm doing in schoolwork
23.01.24, 15:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going?
23.01.24, 15:26 - Niki: Not feeling great in what way headache ?
23.01.24, 15:27 - Niki: Procrastinating abit to much right now but else fine
23.01.24, 15:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, just mentally drained, idk why, I was already feeling like this yesterday too
23.01.24, 15:27 - Niki: Mabye a walk can help or social interaction ?
23.01.24, 15:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, I feel like hugging and crying but I'm not gonna do either so I'll just go through it
23.01.24, 15:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Perhaps this is PMS, who the fuck knows?
23.01.24, 15:30 - Niki: Mabye watch a sad movie or your favorite one?
23.01.24, 15:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, maybe but that also sounds like a waste of time when I have to study
23.01.24, 15:32 - Niki: True 😅
23.01.24, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll figure it out, no worries
23.01.24, 15:33 - Niki: if i can help tell me 🥰
23.01.24, 15:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would if there was anything but I don't think so? But thanks for the offer hon ❤
23.01.24, 15:34 - Niki: okay hon ❤️😅
23.01.24, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm dead
23.01.24, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How you doing?
23.01.24, 19:48 - Niki: Not good but tell me more? How dead are you 😅
23.01.24, 19:48 - Niki: Okayish making food now and studied abit befor.
23.01.24, 19:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mentally was already the case, but now physically too. Went to the store for food with my parents and man... I felt like I was gonna faint the whole time
23.01.24, 19:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds good
23.01.24, 19:50 - Niki: Did you eat and drink enough today or is it nor explainable?
23.01.24, 19:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would say I have yeah
23.01.24, 19:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk what brought it on
23.01.24, 19:51 - Niki: Mabye too much inside the house or to less movement?
23.01.24, 19:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you having for dinner?
23.01.24, 19:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would have thought so too, but going outside and moving made it worse
23.01.24, 19:52 - Niki: Insta ramen but a bit of vegetable in there and some hard boiled egg
23.01.24, 19:52 - Niki: Your still feeling like that?
23.01.24, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
23.01.24, 19:53 - Niki: Its getting better or worse?
23.01.24, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, kinda the same
23.01.24, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My heart is doing better than before though, so that's good
23.01.24, 19:53 - Niki: Try to sleep it out?
23.01.24, 19:53 - Niki: Good to hear
23.01.24, 19:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want to sleep yet, have to eat dinner first
23.01.24, 19:54 - Niki: Yeah good idea mabye see after dinner how you feel?
23.01.24, 19:55 - Niki: Your parents know hoe you feel?

23.01.24, 19:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah yeah I know
23.01.24, 19:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I've had this before
23.01.24, 19:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eventually it will pass
23.01.24, 19:56 - Niki: And you wait it out or what?
23.01.24, 19:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Never found out what causes it
23.01.24, 19:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah basically
23.01.24, 19:56 - Niki: Ah i see you are that kind of person i suspect it but wasnt sure
23.01.24, 19:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What does that mean 🥲
23.01.24, 19:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And if so, it's probably my dad's fault I am this way
23.01.24, 19:57 - Niki: Well some people dont go to the doctor for thinks that appear for while to whilr
23.01.24, 19:58 - Niki: Yeah think so tok but also i would think your mom is the same
23.01.24, 19:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, my mom goes to the doctor when she's worried about something
23.01.24, 19:58 - Niki: By the way there is a fsk 18 channel in the dc?

23.01.24, 20:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You don't go to the doctor for that bump on your neck either
23.01.24, 20:01 - Niki: I was when i was 13 or so they said it was fine
23.01.24, 20:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm

23.01.24, 23:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I want to talk to you
23.01.24, 23:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk about what
23.01.24, 23:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just missing your stupidly handsome face
23.01.24, 23:51 - Niki: How are you feeling now would give me some peace of mind
23.01.24, 23:51 - Niki: ?
23.01.24, 23:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Feeling better than before if that's what you mean
23.01.24, 23:52 - Niki: Oh thanks hon 🥰 miss you too. Would love to lay in your arms right now ❤️
23.01.24, 23:52 - Niki: Yeah like way better or just not fainting anymore better?
23.01.24, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not fainting anymore
23.01.24, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Bit more energy
23.01.24, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mentally meh
23.01.24, 23:53 - Niki: Mh well i hope tomorrow  it will be better 🙏🏼
23.01.24, 23:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So in between
23.01.24, 23:53 - Niki: Tell me more?
23.01.24, 23:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's really not a lot to say other than just being exhausted and not feeling good about anything I've done so far during this whole exam period, nevermind the exam that I have to take on Friday
23.01.24, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't really want to talk about that though
23.01.24, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's nothing to do about it anyway and the more I think about it the more stressed I get about it, the worse I feel
23.01.24, 23:55 - Niki: Ah okay if you every feel like talk about. We can talk
23.01.24, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon, but probably not anytime soon until I get my grades or something
23.01.24, 23:56 - Niki: How about the dc any new friends? Any other news?
23.01.24, 23:56 - Niki: Also i am only reading your text and the once you interact with
23.01.24, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte joined and is totally projecting on some of the people's experiences
23.01.24, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I figured that would be the case, there's too much going on anyway
23.01.24, 23:57 - Niki: If you want me not to read them oe quit the dd because its a save space or you want some room tell me any time
23.01.24, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No no
23.01.24, 23:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Definitely not the case
23.01.24, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's some people that want to complain about their partners but I'm definitely not one of them
23.01.24, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a safe space for all people in LDR relationships
23.01.24, 23:58 - Niki: You can if you wanna to and you can also tell me
23.01.24, 23:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you ever want to talk in there without my knowledge you can just tell me, I won't look then
23.01.24, 23:59 - Niki: Yeah i know but still sometimes for presents or other stuff its nice knowing the other person wouldn't find out
23.01.24, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Why would I complain about you when I can just tell you how I feel and we can resolve it in a healthy communication way as we've done so far?
23.01.24, 23:59 - Niki: Yeah that's what I wanted to say too but in a more extreme way i se now
23.01.24, 23:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, if it's about presents I'll just DM someone about it
23.01.24, 23:59 - Niki: Yeah definitely
24.01.24, 00:00 - Niki: Okay nevermind was just one thing ony mind
24.01.24, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still, if there's ever anything bothering you that you want a second opinion on before talking to me, please don't hesitate to use the group
24.01.24, 00:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I promise if you tell me I will stay away from it until long after you're done
24.01.24, 00:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I want you to have a space to talk about these kinds of things too
24.01.24, 00:02 - Niki: Yeah will do
24.01.24, 00:02 - Niki: Thanks hon same for you obviously
24.01.24, 00:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apart from that though, I really still dislike texting with you hon 😭
24.01.24, 00:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You just disappear when you think the topic is done and I still want to talk about other shit 🥲 (other topic) or just anything
24.01.24, 00:05 - Niki: With me 😅 sorry but you just need to text i will answer immediately no worrys i am still laying in bed and my phone is on
24.01.24, 00:05 - Niki: I dont need to be the person to start the conversation
24.01.24, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah but I don't want to have to be the person keeping the conversation up and running the whole time
24.01.24, 00:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because I am that person usually, even the one to start a conversation
24.01.24, 00:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And maybe I'm being clingy today, but meh
24.01.24, 00:06 - Niki: Last topic i started and the one befor that too
24.01.24, 00:06 - Niki: Nah not really
24.01.24, 00:07 - Niki: Scrolling up?
24.01.24, 00:07 - Niki: 🤭
24.01.24, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey... If I didn't text you asking how your day is going we wouldn't even be talking
24.01.24, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And if I then after that didn't say I want to talk about something, we also wouldn't be talking
24.01.24, 00:07 - Niki: Yeah but i could have just wrote good... 😂
24.01.24, 00:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So who took the initiative?
24.01.24, 00:08 - Niki: Jk jk
24.01.24, 00:08 - Niki: You my love 😘🥰
24.01.24, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Bitch you better not
24.01.24, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Exactly

24.01.24, 00:08 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
24.01.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Another one of Alex's stickers?
24.01.24, 00:09 - Niki: I see
24.01.24, 00:09 - Niki: Yes i got more you wanna see
24.01.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So what are ya gonna do about it?
24.01.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't try to distract me heathen
24.01.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (but yes please)
24.01.24, 00:10 - Niki: Fight you too somebody surrenders on a vulcanizing planet on outer space with swords of light
24.01.24, 00:10 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
24.01.24, 00:10 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
24.01.24, 00:10 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
24.01.24, 00:10 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
24.01.24, 00:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: no thanks
24.01.24, 00:11 - Niki: Thats all
24.01.24, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The fuck
24.01.24, 00:11 - Niki: Awww okay 🥲
24.01.24, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hey I made this picture
24.01.24, 00:11 - Niki: Yeah he has a weird sens of humor sometimes
24.01.24, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What does that even say?
24.01.24, 00:11 - Niki: But he likes the pictures i geuss? ¿
24.01.24, 00:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess
24.01.24, 00:12 - Niki: My name was a business brunch think
24.01.24, 00:13 - Niki: You can put them as favorite so you have then too
24.01.24, 00:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But seriously, I just sometimes do want you to send me a random message because quite frankly getting a message from you makes my day a lot better and I like seeing that you think of me if that makes sense
24.01.24, 00:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How do you do that?
24.01.24, 00:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Found it
24.01.24, 00:15 - Niki: Yeah i love too but at some points during the day i don't wanna distract you and in the evening i glad  can do. Also hope you believe me on that one but sometimes i think about it bit you already send one at that time <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
24.01.24, 00:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I told you, you really don't have to worry about distracting me. If you say that one more time I'm gonna make you write a bunch of times when you get here so it actually stays in your head 🥲
24.01.24, 00:17 - Niki: Sorry my love but you will never get this thought out of my mind 😅
24.01.24, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
24.01.24, 00:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is so stupid
24.01.24, 00:17 - Niki: Mabye a lot of kisses can help me remember 🤭🥰
24.01.24, 00:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then just overrule us everytime you think of it
24.01.24, 00:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yes, because I can do that from 800km away
24.01.24, 00:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You get a lot of kisses anyway 😭
24.01.24, 00:18 - Niki: Not now but when I am over hon.
24.01.24, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, why would I have to bribe you for this?
24.01.24, 00:19 - Niki: Allways want more in retrospect you know how it goes to fast when i am there <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
24.01.24, 00:19 - Niki: Because you like the bribe?
24.01.24, 00:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know hon, but quite frankly I do believe we're at the height of efficiency in kiss-time vs time of stay at this point
24.01.24, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love the bribe, but there's no need for a bribe when you already get the bribe
24.01.24, 00:20 - Niki: Would love to see a power point of this 🙏🏼🤭
24.01.24, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
24.01.24, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't tempt me
24.01.24, 00:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know I love a ridiculous PowerPoint
24.01.24, 00:21 - Niki: Sorry having mabye abir too much fun right now my love 🥰
24.01.24, 00:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No I like it 😘
24.01.24, 00:21 - Niki: I know but i would also like to know the math behind it
24.01.24, 00:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm having fun too ❤️
24.01.24, 00:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man... Why do you take the fun out of things 🥲 what math?
24.01.24, 00:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This is just based off of experience
24.01.24, 00:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not looking at the clock every time we kiss 😭
24.01.24, 00:22 - Niki: Well some soiled reasoning behind the curve or what ever way of showing the data you show
24.01.24, 00:23 - Niki: Well not good research then 😅
24.01.24, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know what is the solid reasoning?
24.01.24, 00:23 - Niki: ?
24.01.24, 00:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because every time when we don't have anything planned, all we do is kiss and cuddle
24.01.24, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We literally only take a break to eat sleep and do things that were planned in advance
24.01.24, 00:24 - Niki: Yeah true and more 😘
24.01.24, 00:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And obviously more
24.01.24, 00:24 - Niki: 🤭 Hehe
24.01.24, 00:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't get me wrong, I'm DEFINITELY not complaining, but peak efficiency has already been reached
24.01.24, 00:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Your bribe isn't bribing
24.01.24, 00:25 - Niki: Oh no 😅
24.01.24, 00:26 - Niki: Well i geuss there goes my plan for even more kisses 😅
24.01.24, 00:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's beside the point of why I would need to bribe you in the first place 🥲
24.01.24, 00:26 - Niki: You don't need to was just a joke but glad we came to the end of it 😅
24.01.24, 00:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you don't think I realise that was a joke then idk how many jokes I've missed that made you think I'm this oblivious 🥲
24.01.24, 00:28 - Niki: Over text its hard sometimes 😅
24.01.24, 00:28 - Niki: But to be honest i am getting tired so i will probably head of to dreamland and i see you there soon?
24.01.24, 00:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean yeah but this is pretty obvious I'd say
24.01.24, 00:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You always get tired so soon 🥲 but fair enough
24.01.24, 00:29 - Niki: Was it really. Need to recalibrate my tools then 🫣
24.01.24, 00:30 - Niki: I am "try" to fix my sleep schedule.
24.01.24, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I know, sorry, you should go to sleep
24.01.24, 00:30 - Niki: Its a harder task then i thought to be honest
24.01.24, 00:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know how difficult it is
24.01.24, 00:31 - Niki: All my friends and gf have a fup schedule
24.01.24, 00:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can you please just think about my request?
24.01.24, 00:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Whoops?
24.01.24, 00:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mine will get better once the semester starts again though
24.01.24, 00:31 - Niki: I will try to focus on it
24.01.24, 00:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank you
24.01.24, 00:32 - Niki: ? What you mean
24.01.24, 00:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just being silly
24.01.24, 00:33 - Niki: My brain is not braining anymore 😅
24.01.24, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Happens to the best
24.01.24, 00:33 - Niki: Goodnight my love see you in dreamland 😘 cutie ❤️

24.01.24, 14:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not really that much better, but okay. How's your day going?
24.01.24, 14:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't think I'll feel much better until after my math exam, so just gotta get through it
24.01.24, 16:57 - Niki: Sorry my i was the only one with the prof in the room 😅
24.01.24, 16:58 - Niki: Text you back soon 🫣
24.01.24, 17:03 - Niki: So you think its stress related?
24.01.24, 17:04 - Niki: My day is alright done with classes today ask the prof some questions was great 😊
24.01.24, 17:05 - Niki: Also i need to do a questionnaire you know any good sites to do them onlind mabye with a qr code

24.01.24, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds productive!
24.01.24, 17:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm... Depends, what kind of data do you need and how many respondents?
24.01.24, 17:08 - Niki: Yes
24.01.24, 17:09 - Niki: One of two to be exact
24.01.24, 17:09 - Niki: Not many a few a hour
24.01.24, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah but is it a quantitative or qualitative questions?

24.01.24, 17:13 - Niki: Text you later drive home
24.01.24, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, drive safe 😘
24.01.24, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You always have Microsoft and Google forms too
24.01.24, 17:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: To easily get data out of Google forms I have a pretty good extension

24.01.24, 18:09 - Niki: Put it in my pocket to walk around in the store and forgot to take it out 😅
24.01.24, 18:10 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>

24.01.24, 18:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I can't believe they showed Master Chief's face in the movie... Did I watch it? no, but still it's bullshit
24.01.24, 18:18 - Niki: Master Chiefs ?

24.01.24, 18:36 - Niki: Discord?
24.01.24, 18:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: nope
24.01.24, 18:36 - Niki: Studying still?

24.01.24, 18:37 - Niki: Wooow yeah fuck yeah i won
24.01.24, 18:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There is no material prize though
24.01.24, 18:37 - Niki: Awww but a kiss?
24.01.24, 18:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We talked about this yesterday
24.01.24, 18:38 - Niki: Yeah i know its more of a joke
24.01.24, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Peak efficiency honey, peak efficiency
24.01.24, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm also just joking along 😘
24.01.24, 18:38 - Niki: PEAK FUCKING EFFICENCY
24.01.24, 18:39 - Niki: Man i dont get half the jokes its crazy i think i need to recalibrate for real this time
24.01.24, 18:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean?
24.01.24, 18:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I thought I was the one not understanding jokes 😅
24.01.24, 18:40 - Niki: I was sure you meant it in a serious way
24.01.24, 18:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, yeah, I guess it's just hard to tell intonation over text
24.01.24, 18:42 - Niki: Yeah but still i kinda wanna get the jokes if you right them to me. Don't wanna ask everytime or get it explained in the worse case 😱
24.01.24, 18:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think we both just need to accept that we're not on at our best in text conversations hon, nothing much we can do about it I'm afraid, except practice perhaps? Idk
24.01.24, 18:43 - Niki: Practice makes perfect but explain a joke still sucks 😢
24.01.24, 18:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: true, but unless we're gonna call about everything there's nothing much to do about it
24.01.24, 18:45 - Niki: True and we cant do that
24.01.24, 18:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: unfortunately no
24.01.24, 18:46 - Niki: Also i saw you gave the discord your Instagram pushing your followers.
24.01.24, 18:46 - Niki: Getting internet famous
24.01.24, 18:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pffttt
24.01.24, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If anyone from there actually follows me I will be hella surprised
24.01.24, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mainly because my username is fucking awful
24.01.24, 18:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And it is only in the thread
24.01.24, 18:48 - Niki: Yeah the thread is hard to read to be honest
24.01.24, 18:48 - Niki: Its nice username i would say
24.01.24, 18:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh I love it too

26.01.24, 10:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can make the exercises we did in class, but the issue is that on the exam, the hardest exercises from the syllabus are the easiest on the exam
26.01.24, 10:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And he focuses a lot on understanding the underlying theory 🥲
26.01.24, 10:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So yeah, will have to see

27.01.24, 17:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I did not need to know this much about other people's sex lives
27.01.24, 17:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind one of the bf's BDSM test results
27.01.24, 17:11 - Niki: huh kinda interested know ?
27.01.24, 17:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One of the girls says she loves to see her period blood on her bf's fingers, it makes her go primal 😭
27.01.24, 17:12 - Niki: wtf
27.01.24, 17:12 - Niki: well some have special kinks
27.01.24, 17:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhu
27.01.24, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But that was also the only kink mentioned so far 😭
27.01.24, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Other than just what they like being called I guess
27.01.24, 17:13 - Niki: damm okay huh some favorites?
27.01.24, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are you asking for my favourites or theirs?
27.01.24, 17:14 - Niki: yes

27.01.24, 17:17 - Niki: aha okay nothing crazy <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>

27.01.24, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
27.01.24, 17:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man... One moment it is wholesome as hell, the next I feel like spraying my brain with holy water
27.01.24, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We talked about first times, or more like, we were reassuring someone about first times because she wants to do it with her bf but is scared so that was kinda nice
27.01.24, 17:26 - Niki: Damm looks really nice. Also kinda like a slytherin ring or Harry potter themed
27.01.24, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's supposed to be jormungandr, the world serpent from Norse mythology, also a child of Loki, the candle is Loki themed
27.01.24, 17:28 - Niki: Can imagine kinda but not fully. Still nice though and definitely entertaining
27.01.24, 17:28 - Niki: Oh okay yeah makes sense to hope it doesn't eat you at the end
27.01.24, 17:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so too, I'd rather have someone else eat me
27.01.24, 17:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Diese Nachricht wurde gelöscht.

27.01.24, 17:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: To be honest the chat itself is okay
27.01.24, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm getting distracted by my own mind
27.01.24, 17:37 - Niki: In the way i think about 😘😳
27.01.24, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably yes

27.01.24, 19:44 - Niki: 50 is crazy
27.01.24, 19:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's an average 😅
27.01.24, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For macroeconomics we went through one of those a class... We had 2 classes a week
27.01.24, 19:47 - Niki: damm whats on the slides ? is the prof eminems cousin ?
27.01.24, 19:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Unfortunately not
27.01.24, 19:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although he sometimes had some unnecessary info
27.01.24, 19:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But still a lot
27.01.24, 20:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom is cooking, god save us
27.01.24, 20:01 - Niki: well it cant be that bad. She is still trying and your mom...
27.01.24, 20:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just joking around no worries
27.01.24, 20:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But honestly no clue, she hasn't cooked in years
27.01.24, 20:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's usually my dad or me cooking
27.01.24, 20:03 - Niki: yeah i know but still. she can still cook or not...
27.01.24, 20:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We shall find out soon
27.01.24, 20:05 - Niki: She will rock it
27.01.24, 20:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The only thing I can remember her making when I was younger are the vegetable burgers I also made for us with an egg and some steamed broccoli or something
27.01.24, 20:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now she's making pasta with mushrooms
27.01.24, 20:05 - Niki: Was good no?
27.01.24, 20:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But she's throwing in some random things too
27.01.24, 20:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, we shall see
27.01.24, 20:06 - Niki: She is being judge?
27.01.24, 20:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah
27.01.24, 20:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I am curious how it's gonna end up
27.01.24, 20:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't be worse than one of Celine's friends or Jinte though
27.01.24, 20:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One of Celine's friends would boil the water, then turn it down and then add the pasta to it... Like... what?
27.01.24, 20:08 - Niki: Why how and whats going on with her?
27.01.24, 20:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: With Celine?
27.01.24, 20:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No clue, haven't talked to her since before the exams
27.01.24, 20:09 - Niki: No with her friend
27.01.24, 20:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooohh
27.01.24, 20:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah no, she's just really fucking bad at cooking
27.01.24, 20:10 - Niki: Is she just crazy?
27.01.24, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She said she was gonna cook for Celine one time but halfway through it was so messed up they ordered food instead
27.01.24, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Civil engineer? You tell me? Or yeah, no, civil engineer turned medicine student
27.01.24, 20:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: not because she failed at engineering, just because it was boring
27.01.24, 20:11 - Niki: Crazy person i see
27.01.24, 20:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Basically

27.01.24, 20:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: People with gun and knife kinks
27.01.24, 20:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Someone wants to see her bf sitting on his knees licking blood of her elbow??? Weirdly specific
27.01.24, 20:19 - Niki: Crazy for sure
27.01.24, 20:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yuppp
27.01.24, 20:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: well
27.01.24, 20:19 - Niki: Yeah but atleast doable for the bf
27.01.24, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yeah but like.. where is the blood coming from though?
27.01.24, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I half understand the knife thing though
27.01.24, 20:20 - Niki: Well thats a single problem
27.01.24, 20:21 - Niki: Huh? Tell me more
27.01.24, 20:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess
27.01.24, 20:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ... It's a little bit hot
27.01.24, 20:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway
27.01.24, 20:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom isn't a terrible cook
27.01.24, 20:21 - Niki: Nah tell me more please 🥺
27.01.24, 20:21 - Niki: Really that bad?
27.01.24, 20:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk what to say
27.01.24, 20:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, it's not bad, just that I miss seasoning like
... Idk salt? Pepper?
27.01.24, 20:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not like I have experience with it ya know?
27.01.24, 20:23 - Niki: What makes it sexy like tell me a scenario? Or what you think about it?
27.01.24, 20:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But probably the pain/being completely vulnerable thing?
27.01.24, 20:23 - Niki: Oh really?
27.01.24, 20:24 - Niki: Okay being completely vulnerable sounds kinda nice to see on you 😘
27.01.24, 20:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still gotta tie me up sometime you know?
27.01.24, 20:24 - Niki: Yeah will glady do that
27.01.24, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also listened to a podcast about BJ's 😅
27.01.24, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Somehow it was Offset talking??
27.01.24, 20:25 - Niki: And any new ideas / conclusions
27.01.24, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't tell me that much but oh well, I'll keep trying
27.01.24, 20:25 - Niki: The rapper?
27.01.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
27.01.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was on a podcast called Call Her Daddy
27.01.24, 20:26 - Niki: Nice name 😂
27.01.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, pretty cool
27.01.24, 20:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom also thinks there's not enough salt 😭
27.01.24, 20:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have a question for you
27.01.24, 20:37 - Niki: sure go on ?
27.01.24, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because you start exams next week I was wondering if there's anything I should do to change like my texts or things like that so you're not too distracted? Is there anything you'd like me to (not) do for the next week?
27.01.24, 20:39 - Niki: no not really to be honest
27.01.24, 20:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You sure? I don't mind not calling for a week or something so you have more time, or just only sending a text in the morning and evening
27.01.24, 20:40 - Niki: no no
27.01.24, 20:40 - Niki: i wanna text with you for sure
27.01.24, 20:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 😊
27.01.24, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently there's a book where a girl is fucked with a gun... Why do people write this shit
27.01.24, 22:36 - Niki: fuck with a gun like a dildo ?
27.01.24, 22:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
27.01.24, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And it's a popular book too 😭
27.01.24, 22:37 - Niki: Okay not the most save option but well if she gets off
27.01.24, 22:37 - Niki: Really? Mabye the rest around it is good written
27.01.24, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pfffttt
27.01.24, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess that's one way to put it
27.01.24, 22:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, doubt it
27.01.24, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've heard it is the most unhinged book of 2023
27.01.24, 22:38 - Niki: I also think if for people how daily read stuff like that
27.01.24, 22:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: To be fair
27.01.24, 22:38 - Niki: Yeah wouldn't be surprised
27.01.24, 22:39 - Niki: Yeah for me a gun would be probably the line
27.01.24, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I can read smut in public without any issues. Have done so in the past, it's really not that difficult once you get desensitized enough
27.01.24, 22:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel like there should be a line before that but okay
27.01.24, 22:40 - Niki: Tell me? Any ideas?
27.01.24, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would draw a line at trying to fuck with a fake gun already
27.01.24, 22:40 - Niki: How far i can push it 😊
27.01.24, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well
27.01.24, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One way to find out I guess
27.01.24, 22:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ;p
27.01.24, 22:40 - Niki: Yeah fake as well would be a line
27.01.24, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Imagine trying to fuck someone with a nerf gun though... That's just weird
27.01.24, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: An actual gun is psychotic, but a nerf gun... Just no
27.01.24, 22:42 - Niki: I couldn't even try just laughing my ass of the howl time
27.01.24, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahahhaha, same 😂
27.01.24, 22:42 - Niki: Kinda wanna text abit longer if you feel like it
27.01.24, 22:43 - Niki: What else is going on in dc / dc18+ chat
27.01.24, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah sure hon, always up for texting with you
27.01.24, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uh... People are sending voice messages, to let people hear their voices??
27.01.24, 22:44 - Niki: Oh and some surprises or some crazy stuff
27.01.24, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also a couple of them sent voice messages from their bf's for us to judge them I guess? Didn't really understand that
27.01.24, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, not really, but interesting how high pitched some people's voice is
27.01.24, 22:44 - Niki: Mabye if they sound lovely
27.01.24, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, was okay I guess
27.01.24, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're just voices? Nothing like David Attenborough or anything
27.01.24, 22:45 - Niki: Wasn't there a think with higher pitch kinda like some one or being nervous or something like that?
27.01.24, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean I guess that's a thing, but I'm pretty sure that was just how she sounds?
27.01.24, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also talked about shower sex
27.01.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And letting your partner know you're gonna take a shower + the appropriate response for that
27.01.24, 22:47 - Niki: And did you give your experiences to it?
27.01.24, 22:47 - Niki: Always coming with you 😘
27.01.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, just gave a thumbs up
27.01.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I meant over text but yes definitely 😘 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
27.01.24, 22:48 - Niki: He's definitely coming?
27.01.24, 22:48 - Niki: 😅😘
27.01.24, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tsss
27.01.24, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You said it
27.01.24, 22:48 - Niki: Yeah i did 😘
27.01.24, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cutie
27.01.24, 22:49 - Niki: And any nice response u could send you next time?
27.01.24, 22:49 - Niki: Cutie too 😘
27.01.24, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite frankly I was disappointed at their answers
27.01.24, 22:49 - Niki: Tell me more?
27.01.24, 22:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The only good one was "wish I could join you and treat you well"
27.01.24, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Other than that it was just "happy showers" or "enjoy the shower"
27.01.24, 22:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: One person just "have a good one"
27.01.24, 22:51 - Niki: Well they suck but i kinda get it if you don't wanna think about it because else you will miss them more but still suck over all
27.01.24, 22:51 - Niki: I would never
27.01.24, 22:52 - Niki: Mabye asking for a picture 😘
27.01.24, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Someone else came to the conclusion (we have no context to how) that nudes look better in black and white 😐
27.01.24, 22:52 - Niki: Mh don't know can't speak to that
27.01.24, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do like your answers a lot more 😘
27.01.24, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also can't, it was really random in the middle of a conversation about something else 😅
27.01.24, 22:53 - Niki: Well mabye they have experience and made a good point <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
27.01.24, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am also so convinced potato and her bf meet up to fuck and barely do anything else, but it's kinda funny
27.01.24, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe yeah, who knows?
27.01.24, 22:54 - Niki: Well 🤗
27.01.24, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No judgement at all
27.01.24, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's just that right after they met up, she came into the chat saying she just got fucked
27.01.24, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And he then joined in talking about how good he did her 🙃
27.01.24, 22:55 - Niki: The nudes or just meeting up to fuck
27.01.24, 22:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Neither
27.01.24, 22:56 - Niki: Okay interesting to talk so open about that but well they can do it i geuss
27.01.24, 22:56 - Niki: ?
27.01.24, 22:57 - Niki: Hon?
27.01.24, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No judgement to either of those
27.01.24, 22:57 - Niki: You there <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
27.01.24, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am here
27.01.24, 22:57 - Niki: Okay 😘
27.01.24, 22:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah it's the 18+ chat so why not
27.01.24, 22:57 - Niki: Ah okay
27.01.24, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also found an interesting list we might want to try out at some point
27.01.24, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's basically a wants/needs/boundaries list for things we might want to try out
27.01.24, 22:58 - Niki: But also weird after fucking to go online and type with friends. Seems to me like he didn't deliver that much
27.01.24, 22:59 - Niki: Okay sure would do it right now if i could 🥰
27.01.24, 22:59 - Niki: No judgment or anything obviously 😅
27.01.24, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not sure how long after this was but yeah, interesting for sure
27.01.24, 23:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I definitely never had the urge after we had sex to go talk to my friends about it no matter how good or bad it was 😂 (though it's never been bad 😘)
27.01.24, 23:01 - Niki: Aww thanks hon 😘😅
27.01.24, 23:01 - Niki: Sams back though😘
27.01.24, 23:02 - Niki: Also the list is like online or where? You wanna do it when we're together or separate
27.01.24, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Might be better to do together but I can send you the link?
27.01.24, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://freebies.hannahdeindorfer.com/sexy-time-menu
27.01.24, 23:03 - Niki: Well together we might influence each other?
27.01.24, 23:04 - Niki: Also that side looks sketchy as hell
27.01.24, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's also true I guess
27.01.24, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, I fully agree
27.01.24, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Haven't downloaded it yet for that reason
27.01.24, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was gonna look at some other websites
27.01.24, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda forgot about it until you mentioned it though
27.01.24, 23:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I crumbled to peer pressure and now I am being told my voice is pretty and my laugh is cute 😭
27.01.24, 23:06 - Niki: It is though
27.01.24, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ...
27.01.24, 23:06 - Niki: Love you voice alot more in person though
27.01.24, 23:06 - Niki: But i also like to shut you up with kisses 😘
27.01.24, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, makes sense, voice recordings distort it a bit <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
27.01.24, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well okayyyy
27.01.24, 23:07 - Niki: You don't like it when i steal your breath?
27.01.24, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't
27.01.24, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love it instead
27.01.24, 23:09 - Niki: Also love it when your doing something and i start distract you abit too much and you lose your self abit
27.01.24, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You do seem to enjoy that quite a bit yeah
27.01.24, 23:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're also thinking about the kitchen or something else?
27.01.24, 23:10 - Niki: Like stopping to peal potatoes and stop thinking
27.01.24, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhu
27.01.24, 23:10 - Niki: Yeah i do
27.01.24, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I thought so 😘
27.01.24, 23:11 - Niki: Just the thought of completly disrespecting you in the kitchen was really hot
27.01.24, 23:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was really really hot
27.01.24, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And a little bit funny afterwards 🤭
27.01.24, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then of course we did end up doing it on the couch
27.01.24, 23:12 - Niki: Yeah but oh well couldn't do it to the new kitchen
27.01.24, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still can't believe my parents haven't said anything about that despite finding my pants in the couch when they got back 😅
27.01.24, 23:13 - Niki: Yeah not the smae though as bending you over while your trying to cook
27.01.24, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah no, definitely not the same
27.01.24, 23:13 - Niki: They did 😅
27.01.24, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You were still there 😭
27.01.24, 23:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yup

27.01.24, 23:34 - Niki: Any idea what we wanna do for it anything?
27.01.24, 23:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just talking in general what I've seen, a lot of people do presents and all that but it seems a bit extra
27.01.24, 23:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I thought we could just do a Valentine's date in Antwerp? Look for some bracelets or something idk
27.01.24, 23:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you have anything in mind?
27.01.24, 23:36 - Niki: Nah not really any ideas
27.01.24, 23:36 - Niki: But Antwerp sounds good 😘
27.01.24, 23:36 - Niki: You know what we did last year?
27.01.24, 23:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll have to figure out part of the day too then though, I'm not gonna be singlehandedly responsible for it 😘
27.01.24, 23:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: To be frank I don't think we did anything last year 😅 maybe went to the movie together? I'm not sure
27.01.24, 23:38 - Niki: Wouldn't want it any other way. Also thought it was obivous this way
27.01.24, 23:38 - Niki: No clue either anymore
27.01.24, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, but this time you're actually gonna plan something? Last time you couldn't with the guy coming to fix the sink and all so maybe this time?
27.01.24, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just know that if we did anything it was after Valentine's and that I was slightly annoyed you just brushed it off on the day itself 😅
27.01.24, 23:40 - Niki: Yes i will try to plan 🙏🏼
27.01.24, 23:41 - Niki: Ups sorry but you need to tell me because I think you didn't
27.01.24, 23:41 - Niki: Wait weren't we in paris at that time?

27.01.24, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think you were here until the start of February and then you went back
27.01.24, 23:42 - Niki: Oh yeah right
27.01.24, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I didn't because I felt silly about it 😅
27.01.24, 23:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which also coincidentally means that it's almost been a year since we lost our virginity 😂
27.01.24, 23:42 - Niki: Just tell me and if its silly i will tell you
27.01.24, 23:43 - Niki: Yeah wow 🥳

28.01.24, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, okayish
28.01.24, 21:42 - Niki: Huh tell me more?
28.01.24, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still a lot to do
28.01.24, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Getting anxious because of it
28.01.24, 21:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it will work out
28.01.24, 21:43 - Niki: Yeah i am sure of it 😘
28.01.24, 21:43 - Niki: You got it hon ❤️
28.01.24, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just really despise my 4 lawbooks sometimes
28.01.24, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can't tell me I have 4 books of 1000+ pages and yet I still can't find the law I'm looking for? Ridiculous
28.01.24, 21:44 - Niki: Can imagine the hate for  them
28.01.24, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're really interesting but goddamn
28.01.24, 21:45 - Niki: Yeah are they all mandatory knowledge
28.01.24, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thank god not
28.01.24, 21:45 - Niki: Also any funny scenario you got as a example?
28.01.24, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I could not remember 4000 pages just like that 😭
28.01.24, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Turns out legally speaking using a nickname in public isn't legal
28.01.24, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I should let you do your thing whoops, sorry
28.01.24, 21:50 - Niki: Nah no worries just takes sometime to answer
28.01.24, 21:50 - Niki: Yeah like completely illegal or how is that work
28.01.24, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's kind of a weird thing that is technically not legal, but not illegal either
28.01.24, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Grey area I guess
28.01.24, 21:51 - Niki: Ah okay so no problem until somebody makes a problem out of it
28.01.24, 21:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I doubt anyone would make a problem out of it unless this happened in a place like a court or something
28.01.24, 21:52 - Niki: Would be funny to see 😅
28.01.24, 21:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhhh, pretty sure it wouldn't go over well with the judge but could be funny yeah
28.01.24, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently I can't sign us up for the dance class... The website just doesn't allow me to? There's no space to sign up? There is one for the 5th so maybe they just made a typo and the class is only on the 5th idk
28.01.24, 22:10 - Niki: hm could be ... sucks though really wanted to go with you
28.01.24, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'll check again tomorrow, see if they maybe fixed it idk
28.01.24, 22:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also really wanted to go with you
28.01.24, 22:11 - Niki: yeah will see ❤️ hope it was just a small error and it sitll happens
28.01.24, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind, apparently there was 1 button for everything, they just added a couple of pictures that looked the same... It's weird, but we're registered!
28.01.24, 22:20 - Niki: 👍🏻 great hon ❤️
28.01.24, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I may have accidentally signed you up as my child though 😅🥲
28.01.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It just said "other family members" so I used that but it turns out that's for children... But oh well 😅
28.01.24, 22:24 - Niki: well mommy its gona be fun
28.01.24, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ew

28.01.24, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let's put it a different way
28.01.24, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you want me to have sex with you, I can not have that image in my head at any time
28.01.24, 22:29 - Niki: okay so if i dont wanna have sex. i will remember that for the futrue
28.01.24, 22:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you realise I don't have that shitty of a brain that I would forget you saying that anytime soon if you do decide to use that
28.01.24, 22:31 - Niki: okay also just joking

29.01.24, 01:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Somehow thinking back of your pickup line and how smooth it was, if remember? Country road... 
Man, I was flustered after that and it wasn't even meant for me 😅😳
29.01.24, 01:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You flirting with me still makes my heart beat faster and I hope that feeling never leaves, so I can feel like I'm falling in love with you again and even deeper every single day
29.01.24, 04:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel like I send these kinds of messages too often

29.01.24, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anxiety
29.01.24, 20:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Caused by stress I guess

29.01.24, 20:56 - Niki: What you mean?
29.01.24, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 6 hours of mathematics and then 3 hours of human resource management
29.01.24, 20:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: After waking up at 5 already 🥲
29.01.24, 20:57 - Niki: Sorry hon 😢
29.01.24, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would have been dead anyway
29.01.24, 20:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least I have something to do that will distract me
29.01.24, 20:58 - Niki: Always look at the positiv side
29.01.24, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, I guess
29.01.24, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Negative side is that you won't be there anymore though
29.01.24, 20:58 - Niki: I know i know 🥲
29.01.24, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Far outweighs the positives
29.01.24, 21:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really fucking hate long distance
29.01.24, 21:01 - Niki: Same but its you 😍
29.01.24, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yeah, the only reason it's worth it is you

29.01.24, 22:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I like it so 🥺
29.01.24, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Do you know how often I've wanted to ask you to tell me everything about you? Because somehow I never feel like I know you well enough. It's why I've started writing things down now, just so I don't forget the things I do know for sure
29.01.24, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know if that makes a lot of sense
29.01.24, 22:53 - Niki: Nah i totally get that but its also natural to forget so don't be worried about it and just ask. Will glady answer you everything about me.
29.01.24, 22:53 - Niki: Still really cute and lovely 🥰
29.01.24, 22:54 - Niki: Real cutie ❤️

29.01.24, 22:55 - Niki: What you wanna know?
29.01.24, 22:55 - Niki: Just like i kinda wanna know this or opinion on that
29.01.24, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Everything? Anything you want to tell me
29.01.24, 22:56 - Niki: Yeah everything
29.01.24, 22:57 - Niki: I am really bad at remembering and hope you wont be mad if i forget your favorite color or hight. Stuff like that mabye? But else nothing on my mind roght now on that part
29.01.24, 22:57 - Niki: *Height
29.01.24, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh sure, tell me the one thing I already know, why don't ya? 😘🙄
29.01.24, 22:58 - Niki: Hehe well you know me then 🥰😅
29.01.24, 22:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I would get mad I would be quite the hypocrite honestly
29.01.24, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Though to be fair your favourite colour changes by the day
29.01.24, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, not that extreme I guess
29.01.24, 22:59 - Niki: Purple or blue at the moment
29.01.24, 22:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Huh, I think it was yellow at some point last year
29.01.24, 23:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or orange, I'm not sure
29.01.24, 23:00 - Niki: Yeah probably remind me just of you 🫣
29.01.24, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And it turned back to purple/blue? What did I do wrong?? 😢 (just kidding)
29.01.24, 23:01 - Niki: Just different things remind me now of you 🦊
29.01.24, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like what?
29.01.24, 23:03 - Niki: Foxes
Blond hair
Waffels
Onesies
Teenie books
Sunlight
.
.
.
29.01.24, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: teenie books?
29.01.24, 23:03 - Niki: Percy Jackson
Harry potter
.
.
.
29.01.24, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: pffttt
29.01.24, 23:04 - Niki: Never had a person how explain the charm of them and who got me into this
29.01.24, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: that's young adult 😭 but I see your point
29.01.24, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was actually confused because I thought you were talking about Tiny books <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
29.01.24, 23:05 - Niki: Young adult 😂 = what teens say to not be called teens 😅
29.01.24, 23:05 - Niki: Also that probably
29.01.24, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no doubt that you don't even know what those are but okay
29.01.24, 23:06 - Niki: Did i start a war with that statement
29.01.24, 23:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: possibly
29.01.24, 23:07 - Niki: Paperback? Is i think the right translation
29.01.24, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: paperback? of tiny?
29.01.24, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, I see where your mind went
29.01.24, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But no
29.01.24, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martine_(character)
29.01.24, 23:08 - Niki: Ups sorry didn't want to please explain when i am over there i think there is a story behind that
29.01.24, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's called Tiny in dutch, but martine in french
29.01.24, 23:09 - Niki: Oh okay yeah never wanted to go in that direction or knew her befor 😅
29.01.24, 23:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There's a whole thing behind it, young adult is usually well written but doesn't cover or go in depth on difficult topics, and of course their main demographic is teenagers and young 20s, then you have new adult which has a bit more spice, and then you get to fiction and non-fiction. They're all okay to read though
29.01.24, 23:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For adults, but the target demographic isn't the same
29.01.24, 23:12 - Niki: Ah okay didn't know that. Makes sense but still never thought of it in that way 😅
Is there more than that?
29.01.24, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably but I would have to do a bit more research to be able to tell you
29.01.24, 23:13 - Niki: Okay nevermind then
29.01.24, 23:13 - Niki: Gone go to bed noe
29.01.24, 23:13 - Niki: Goodnight my fox cuddling love ❤️
Don't go to bed to late 😘
29.01.24, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I should go to bed soon too, but I'm afraid I won't be able to fall asleep again
29.01.24, 23:14 - Niki: Wanna mabye call and fall asleep together mabye that helps?
29.01.24, 23:14 - Niki: Only if you want to
29.01.24, 23:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my love ❤ hope you have pleasant dreams and a revitalising slee
29.01.24, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, can try that if you really don't mind
29.01.24, 23:15 - Niki: Nope not at all
29.01.24, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just give me 5 mins okay? I'll get ready for bed

30.01.24, 10:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, I also woke up at 5... Hope you didn't wake up for the same reason though, sounds like an animal was trying to dig a hole to my room from the neighbours house
30.01.24, 10:20 - Niki: The Fucking birds 😢
30.01.24, 10:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could be mice too I guess but it was very disconcerting
30.01.24, 15:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would actually say that went pretty well
30.01.24, 15:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But with multiple-choice it's always hard to tell
30.01.24, 15:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going hon? 😘
30.01.24, 15:17 - Niki: Sounds great hon ❤️
30.01.24, 15:18 - Niki: feeling way better now or still anxiety ?

30.01.24, 21:24 - Niki: Great sounds really nice.
Thanks hon❤️
30.01.24, 23:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't go to sleep too late hon, make sure you're well rested 😘
30.01.24, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (yes I am a hypocrite for saying that)
30.01.24, 23:21 - Niki: Same thought going to sleep soon jo worries

31.01.24, 09:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm happy to hear that
31.01.24, 10:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: There is now an Instagram group...
31.01.24, 10:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I swear to god
31.01.24, 10:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not okay
31.01.24, 10:07 - Niki: From the dc group?
31.01.24, 10:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
31.01.24, 10:07 - Niki: You send each other memes?
31.01.24, 10:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I didn't even ask to be in there 😭
31.01.24, 10:07 - Niki: Ldr memes
31.01.24, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, unfortunately that is not the purpose
31.01.24, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would love memes
31.01.24, 10:08 - Niki: Any new stuff on the discord like news or cossip?
31.01.24, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's just because the DC gets chaotic sometimes and there's less people in the Instagram...
31.01.24, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope... I am severely disappointed
31.01.24, 10:09 - Niki: Ah i see the inmer circle
31.01.24, 10:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also do not know who half the people are because they have different names/pictures 🥲
31.01.24, 10:09 - Niki: Well mabye you can figure it out over time
31.01.24, 10:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I muted it, I don't want to deal with all those notifications too 😭

31.01.24, 10:10 - Niki: Laeticia yeah
31.01.24, 10:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No I am, but I really despise notifications I can't get rid of easily
31.01.24, 10:11 - Niki: What are you up too now? Still in bed?
31.01.24, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And quite frankly I also don't think it needs to be on 2 different platforms
31.01.24, 10:11 - Niki: 100% true
31.01.24, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, already showered but I do need to get some breakfast

01.02.24, 20:58 - Niki: Saw that one not a fan
01.02.24, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He's a comedian, he's pretty funny I think, but the opposite of dark humour. His last show is a bit of a doozy though, too much accountability and not enough jokes
01.02.24, 20:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
01.02.24, 21:54 - Niki: Sounds interesting will keep him in mind
01.02.24, 21:56 - Niki: Just got out off being held hostage by Fabian jk just talk. Talk with alex about exam and his new friend (she) 🤫. Also just hanging out a bit.

01.02.24, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope Alex's exam went well
01.02.24, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I want to ask but I will wait until you get the okay to tell me from Alex
01.02.24, 21:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you don't get PTSD from being held hostage by Fabian
01.02.24, 21:57 - Niki: Sorry for letting you on read. The last 3 hours was business even though i want to relax 😅🥲.
01.02.24, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Quite frankly I didn't see I was held on read 😅
01.02.24, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too ❤️
01.02.24, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you can sleep better tonight 😘
01.02.24, 21:58 - Niki: Okay yeah feld just bad about it
01.02.24, 21:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would feel different about it if I noticed I guess but idk, I didn't? 😅
01.02.24, 21:59 - Niki: Also really miss you and can't wait to hug you
01.02.24, 21:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Really miss you too hon, can't wait for Tuesday 💜🥺
01.02.24, 22:00 - Niki: Goodnight my cuddle fox 🦊🧡
01.02.24, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my lovely silly goose guy 💜😘
01.02.24, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
01.02.24, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
01.02.24, 23:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I almost got someone kicked out of the DC... Well, it's his own fault but still
01.02.24, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Update
01.02.24, 23:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He got kicked out
01.02.24, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I got Mae's bf booted 😅
01.02.24, 23:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mae is not mad at me
01.02.24, 23:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I... Okay then, special situation for sure
02.02.24, 00:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But seriously... The first person to get kicked out and it is because of me 🥲
02.02.24, 09:26 - Niki: What happened exactly?
02.02.24, 09:27 - Niki: Good morning beautiful 😘
02.02.24, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning my love 😘
02.02.24, 09:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I asked for their perspective on the Matthew situation
02.02.24, 09:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In hindsight I probably should have known they were gonna say it's a grooming situation but anyway, that's not the point
02.02.24, 09:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They were all trying to convince me of that, and I said that I understand where they're coming from but throwing a friendship of 3 years away isn't exactly a thing you do on a whimsy so it's not an easy thing to expect someone to just do so. Mae's bf called me stupid, dumb and ignorant. I asked him to stop because I was kind of done with it and didn't want to talk about it anymore. He doubled down and once again said I'm ignorant. I again asked him to stop. He once again did not 😅.
The girls didn't like that. Especially when he then said that he wasn't being mean, he was just saying what he thought. The whole idea of the group is support and he was massively judging so he was kicked out eventually
02.02.24, 09:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also because he called Emma (the creator of the group) blind for agreeing with me
02.02.24, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Anyway, it was a whole situation
02.02.24, 09:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you had a good night sleep hon 😘
02.02.24, 09:55 - Niki: Damm what a ass. Sounds like a really stupid idiot. The hate for him just got really high by reading that 😤
02.02.24, 09:55 - Niki: Sleept really good thanks for ask 🥰
02.02.24, 09:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, he's a bit of an ass indeed. Mae talked to him about it afterwards though and she says he understands what he did wrong but still, it's a shitty thing to do
02.02.24, 09:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm really happy to read that 😊
02.02.24, 10:02 - Niki: Yeah definitely also just like "i understand" no apologies nothing just like a shitty brat 😤 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
02.02.24, 10:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well he was kicked out before so he couldn't apologise but yeah yeah.. you have a point 😘
02.02.24, 10:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, for when we wanted to move our call from yesterday, I'm hanging out with Alex tomorrow so tomorrow won't work. It's either tonight or on Sunday then (or Monday I guess?) Idk what you prefer
02.02.24, 10:08 - Niki: Sunday would probably
02.02.24, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You sure? That's right before your exam though
02.02.24, 10:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you'd rather not I understand that too, I can wait until Tuesday
02.02.24, 10:09 - Niki: Nah its good that way trust me
02.02.24, 10:09 - Niki: Mabye i can sleep that wqy abit longer
02.02.24, 10:10 - Niki: I can't wait that long
02.02.24, 10:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I hope that helps then ❤️
02.02.24, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For my own sake I can't either, but for you I could 😘
02.02.24, 10:12 - Niki: Cutie 😘
02.02.24, 12:12 - Niki: There is a book fair in Leipzig on the 21.03 24.03. Mabye you wanna come over?
02.02.24, 12:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds fun but I'll have to see about my classes
02.02.24, 12:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would also be coming over the next week though, so I'll see about the price for train tickets
02.02.24, 12:58 - Niki: Okay will see can talk in person tomorrow about it
02.02.24, 12:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tomorrow? Sunday?
02.02.24, 12:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yeah, sounds good to talk about it

02.02.24, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds good, honestly can't remember the last time I ate one
02.02.24, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just tossed my bowl of boiling soup over my hand 🥲 my soup 😭
02.02.24, 13:18 - Niki: No your hands everything okay
02.02.24, 13:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Bit hurt but nothing bad
02.02.24, 13:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I may have underestimated it a bit
02.02.24, 13:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But still manageable

06.02.24, 05:11 - Niki: We need to buy a dark chocolate with chili pepper flavor
06.02.24, 05:38 - Niki: Omw now 🥰
06.02.24, 05:58 - Niki: The first train is already late 🥳. So won't get my second train
06.02.24, 05:58 - Niki: Could f...ing kill somebody
06.02.24, 07:21 - Niki: Took the wrong train....
06.02.24, 07:22 - Niki: Booked a new train
06.02.24, 07:24 - Niki: Will be there at the same time
06.02.24, 07:24 - Niki: One mistake cost me 135 euros yeah

06.02.24, 08:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Where did you accidentally take the train to?
06.02.24, 08:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also am kind of confused why you bought a new ticket though, if your first train was too late to get the second one? That means you can take whatever connection to get to your destination right?
06.02.24, 08:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But my brain might be confused because I just woke up idk
06.02.24, 08:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, good morning hon 😘

06.02.24, 08:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still 14:21? Because that seems kind of impossible
06.02.24, 08:10 - Niki: At the start it was late but them the name on the sigm change and it was the other way 🥲
06.02.24, 08:11 - Niki: Good morning

06.02.24, 08:11 - Niki: Dont know it works
06.02.24, 08:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah shit, I see... That's such a shitty thing though... How can they just move the train to the opposite destination there? So stupid. Almost had the same thing one time though
06.02.24, 08:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That is... Interesting
06.02.24, 08:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So you're in Berlin now or where did you get off to get a different train then?
06.02.24, 08:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also 135€ one way is absolutely insane Jesus Christ
06.02.24, 08:15 - Niki: Yeah did a ups with that to be honest

06.02.24, 08:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
06.02.24, 08:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope the rest of your trip is better

06.02.24, 09:45 - Niki: I wont be in gent at 14:21

06.02.24, 09:47 - Niki: So my new ticket now is to Köln qnd from Köln to Brüssel midi at 14:35
06.02.24, 09:48 - Niki: Should be at gent at 15:21 in the end
06.02.24, 09:49 - Niki: Sorry that i didn't wanna talk about it befor but i was just so mad at my self but now its all sorted with myself
06.02.24, 11:07 - Niki: Right now at Frankfurt
06.02.24, 11:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh okay
06.02.24, 11:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That makes a lot more sense
06.02.24, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On your next train already?
06.02.24, 11:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's okay, I get it
06.02.24, 11:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just went back to sleep after worrying about it for a while 😅
06.02.24, 11:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, I see, now I understand why your ticket cost so much
06.02.24, 11:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You have to take a Eurostar for a bit
06.02.24, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And yes I did check out your train schedule and I'm not sorry for that, I worry about you and wanted to know the odds of things going wrong again
06.02.24, 11:52 - Niki: Yes
06.02.24, 11:53 - Niki: Okay no worries i was worried you were mad. To be honest i would have 100 % done the same
06.02.24, 11:53 - Niki: All of them were like 120 or 100€ i mean booking the day of the train is abit special
06.02.24, 11:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay nice, hope it isn't too busy on the train
06.02.24, 11:54 - Niki: Nah pretty chill
06.02.24, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not mad, trust me when I say I know exactly how frustrating train travel is at times. I just remembered when I asked for your train schedule and said that I like to track the trains schedule last week you kinda reacted like that was stalking 😅
06.02.24, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Capitalist pigs
06.02.24, 11:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good, I'm glad
06.02.24, 11:56 - Niki: Its like stalking but if you do it its kinda okay <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
06.02.24, 11:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still don't really understand that take but okay. Guess that's what happens when you grow up tracking planes of your family when they go on vacation. I'd say it's stalking if I knew exactly where you were the whole time, but I don't? Anyway, doesn't matter, I just don't get it
06.02.24, 11:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh
06.02.24, 11:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Before I forget
06.02.24, 12:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Made a couple of plans for the week
06.02.24, 12:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We would go out for a drink with Jinte tomorrow, that was a compromise for spending the whole day with her 😅
06.02.24, 12:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And on Friday evening we'll go to Aeneas with my dad (my mom can't because she'll be home too late)
06.02.24, 12:02 - Niki: I dont know either its more of a feeling think for me
06.02.24, 12:02 - Niki: But like i said i will glady share it with you
06.02.24, 12:03 - Niki: Plans sound good up for everything as long as it is with you 😘
06.02.24, 12:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I'm glad, still could cancel things if you don't feel up to it though
06.02.24, 12:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay fair enough
06.02.24, 12:44 - Niki: Damm euro star is weird as fuck
06.02.24, 12:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Really? How come?
06.02.24, 12:45 - Niki: Need to show my ticket to get in
06.02.24, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've been on one once before but I don't remember
06.02.24, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ooohhh, yeah, that's because they go to France
06.02.24, 12:45 - Niki: Its smells horrible and they are all eating weird food
06.02.24, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The Fronch
06.02.24, 12:46 - Niki: They dont controll in the train?
06.02.24, 12:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No I know that, but it goes to France and most trains that operate within France you have to show your ticket before entering
06.02.24, 12:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Remember when we went to Paris? In Lille we also had to scan our ticket before entering the train
06.02.24, 13:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Long distance is always like that
06.02.24, 13:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: In France
06.02.24, 13:36 - Niki: Oh yeah right
06.02.24, 13:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you bring enough food and drinks for the trip?
06.02.24, 15:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got on your train to Ghent?
06.02.24, 15:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hello??

12.02.24, 05:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He just came back inside
12.02.24, 05:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Saying goodbye is hard but I'd rather have those moments too than to give those away. Any moment more with you is worth it. So I also won't be walking away before the train leaves again
12.02.24, 05:56 - Niki: Okay get that hope it wasn't that bad this time 🥲
12.02.24, 05:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Saying goodbye always hurts
12.02.24, 05:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doesn't really matter who leaves

12.02.24, 19:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, alright

12.02.24, 19:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It became a bit too much for me

16.02.24, 10:15 - Niki: Hope you have a great day today 😘
16.02.24, 11:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just about to give blood, I'm nervous 🥲
16.02.24, 11:02 - Niki: You got it and jintes is there 😅
16.02.24, 11:02 - Niki: Tell me how it went
16.02.24, 11:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True true
16.02.24, 11:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will do
16.02.24, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still alive
16.02.24, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jinte and I both failed to give the full amount
16.02.24, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a panic attack
16.02.24, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good times
16.02.24, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also took way longer than expected so I couldn't get a good lunch 😅
16.02.24, 13:09 - Niki: What tell me more why or what happened. How you felling
16.02.24, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But if my teacher is a lot later I'm just leaving
16.02.24, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am feeling okay, Jinte went first and wasn't feeling well which stressed me out more than expected
16.02.24, 13:09 - Niki: You have class after donations is that a good idea?
16.02.24, 13:10 - Niki: Yeah would also thinking jinte first isnt a good idea
16.02.24, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well I'm already here and it was closer to my class than to home so idk
16.02.24, 13:10 - Niki: Okay
16.02.24, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We weren't planning that though. I actually went first but the examination to check if I could give blood took longet
16.02.24, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *longer
16.02.24, 13:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently she didn't eat enough
16.02.24, 13:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And then halfway through my donation I started panicking
16.02.24, 13:12 - Niki: Ah okay and you then stop. You know why the attack?
16.02.24, 13:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They stopped the donation really quickly and gave me a bag to breathe in (which is kinda weird)
16.02.24, 13:13 - Niki: Yeah its to calm the blood flow i think
16.02.24, 13:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably combo of already being nervous, Jinte not doing good and then just idk
16.02.24, 13:14 - Niki: Yeah makes sense but you still did it . Proud of you ❤️
16.02.24, 13:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess, not sure I'll do it again anytime soon though 😅
16.02.24, 13:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going hon?
16.02.24, 13:19 - Niki: Finish the assigment mostly and doing some chores
16.02.24, 13:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds good
16.02.24, 13:21 - Niki: Any other plans than jinte meet up for today ?
16.02.24, 13:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, but that will take all of tonight so there's really no other time for anything else 😅
16.02.24, 13:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Especially if it turns out that the class is running until 16:30 instead of 16 🙄
16.02.24, 13:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Meeting up with Jinte and her fam at 18:30 for dinner
16.02.24, 13:24 - Niki: Ah okay sucks overall but hope you can still relax abit more later before jinte comes over
16.02.24, 13:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so too
16.02.24, 13:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm mainly annoyed because it means I can't see my parents before they leave for Greece anymore
16.02.24, 13:25 - Niki: Oh right they are flying to day. Mabye just leave abit early?
16.02.24, 13:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, might go home during the break, I already have a headache so probably not a bad idea anyway
16.02.24, 13:26 - Niki: Good 👍🏻
16.02.24, 13:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also because it took so long I couldn't go back home for my backpack so I bored some paper from Jinte and a pen from Celine, It's quite sad 🥲
16.02.24, 13:37 - Niki: Prof sees you and is like them nobody is prepared
16.02.24, 13:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Prof is way too late
16.02.24, 13:37 - Niki: xD
16.02.24, 13:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He doesn't see anything
16.02.24, 13:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Prof just came in
16.02.24, 13:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not looking forward to this 🥲

16.02.24, 16:49 - Niki: Okay your going to the other party by the way?
16.02.24, 16:49 - Niki: How are you feeling now? A few hours after donating
16.02.24, 16:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, but gonna go for dinner with Jinte at 18:30 first
16.02.24, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm okay, feeling good physically, just kinda not nice to use my arm
16.02.24, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Feels like the blood is praying out when I put too much force, but obviously that's not the case, it's just weird 🥲
16.02.24, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
16.02.24, 17:19 - Niki: It hurts or it feels weird?
16.02.24, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Weird
16.02.24, 17:20 - Niki: Ah okay sounds weird could be a mental thing. But doesn't sounds that bad but hope it goes away fast still 🙏🏼
16.02.24, 17:22 - Niki: Playing games with marco. Need to cook something in 30 min or so. Also needing to shop later.
16.02.24, 17:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: busy boy
16.02.24, 17:55 - Niki: Thanks
16.02.24, 18:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hate changing the sheets

19.02.24, 23:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He's expensive as hell
19.02.24, 23:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just didn't know what to say and he was awkward too
19.02.24, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Made me feel dumb though
19.02.24, 23:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So yeah, idk, I don't really want to take tutoring from him🥲
19.02.24, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He's not wrong but still
20.02.24, 00:08 - Niki: Yeah no its a person thing because you dont like him as a person?
20.02.24, 00:08 - Niki: How expensive if i may ask?
20.02.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, it was only a 13 min call so hard to tell but he clearly was not looking forward to tutoring me too 😅
20.02.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: €50/hour
20.02.24, 00:09 - Niki: Damm that's like a professional wtf
20.02.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because apparently he doesn't have anyone as bad as me that can team up so it would only be €30
20.02.24, 00:09 - Niki: Yeah thats expensive
20.02.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhhhh, he's been doing it for 8 years so I guess he is professional

20.02.24, 00:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm, that's the thing though, he said that I probably wouldn't pass the exam the first time anyway, which kinda defeats the point

24.02.24, 17:17 - Niki: Yup 100%
24.02.24, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tell him that he either needs to recalibrate his clock or he needs to redefine his definition of lunch 😅
24.02.24, 17:17 - Niki: Why did i make does meetings its a shit show
24.02.24, 17:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... Idk?? It has to get done at some point? But I do agree that this isn't the way to do it
24.02.24, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Being a CEO is hard work hon 🥲❤️
24.02.24, 17:18 - Niki: Well there was a crash on the way here but still he told he will drive frim Leipzig around 15 which is also late

24.02.24, 20:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would say the odds of this kind of thing happening are just higher today, with carnival and a cycling race both happening in Gent a lot of people are getting drunk
24.02.24, 20:20 - Niki: Damm gent is a lively city. Also drunk people should be avoid ngl
24.02.24, 20:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well, hard to do when I don't know where they're gonna be and I'm just going to the store 😅

29.02.24, 09:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Had a weird dream last night but overall slept pretty well. How was your night?
29.02.24, 09:03 - Niki: Good morning sugar. Slept way too long and had a okayish night
29.02.24, 09:03 - Niki: What was the dream about?
29.02.24, 09:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We were part of a tv show or something with a bunch of other people and had to perform a dance performance where you were stuck together with your partner. Some other girls didn't know we were together so they tried to set me up with a macho guy which I didn't like, but then when it was time for pictures I was asking you to stand with me and you wouldn't so I thought you were embarrassed to be with me and I said "well if you don't want to be seen with me I will just go to that guy they were trying to set me up with" but then we made up and also did the dance together. And then everyone fell asleep and I woke up (still in the dream) feeling guilty for manipulating you like that because now you were being standoffish
29.02.24, 09:09 - Niki: Damm girl is dreaming the drama. But yeah sounds weird aa fuck. Hope my dream self could dance abit
29.02.24, 09:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was a really weird dance, I was carrying you around in a backpack
29.02.24, 09:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Moral of the story, don't get embarrassed to take pictures with me ;p
29.02.24, 09:12 - Niki: Would never
29.02.24, 09:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You were weighing nothing too, the whole time I was thinking you should eat more 😭
29.02.24, 09:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Update, I feel worse than yesterday and probably will have to throw up... I thought I was better the fuck
29.02.24, 09:51 - Niki: Damm hope you get through it 🙏🏼
29.02.24, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think being nauseous was mostly because I was hungry
29.02.24, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But in my defence that's hard to tell sometimes
29.02.24, 13:39 - Niki: Yeah but i man you can think when you ladt at and see if it makes sense then
29.02.24, 13:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honestly didn't make sense <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
29.02.24, 13:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's either than or being pregnant because I do feel better after eating
29.02.24, 13:43 - Niki: That would be crazy but i don't think so
29.02.24, 13:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It better not be the case, I'd be very annoyed <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>

03.03.24, 09:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (also if I get grouchy halfway through the week (or earlier) it's just because I'm missing you probably)
03.03.24, 10:15 - Niki: Nice people
03.03.24, 10:15 - Niki: On the mountain now can't really text

03.03.24, 14:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Noice, hope the food there is good
03.03.24, 14:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Big group of people then, you're all sleeping in the same house/hotel or how does it work?
03.03.24, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope you're having a great time
03.03.24, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I went shopping with my mom today but I'm not entirely sure about the shoes I ended up with 😅
03.03.24, 14:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.03.24, 14:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.03.24, 14:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.03.24, 14:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.03.24, 15:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am having doubts with what I ended up buying.... Whelp

03.03.24, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm probably returning the shoes though
03.03.24, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.03.24, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Didn't like how the whole outfit looks
03.03.24, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But you'll probably be happy to know I bought your number one pick 😅
03.03.24, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And number 4 too but that's for another kind of event anyway
03.03.24, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day been so far? (If you have time to chat that is)
03.03.24, 17:25 - Niki: Yeah thought you would by it its your style. Even if its not foe the event
03.03.24, 17:25 - Niki: Yeah no they dont fit
03.03.24, 17:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
03.03.24, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also kind of doubting the dress like this but idk
03.03.24, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still figuring things out
03.03.24, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doesn't matter, shopping sucks anyway so I hate that this didn't work
03.03.24, 17:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ?
03.03.24, 17:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will take it that you do not have time then :)
03.03.24, 17:30 - Niki: Was nice got fucking recked on the skys today head was spinning
03.03.24, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do not understand if that means you're exhausted from skiing all day or if someone crashed into you and that's why your head was spinning, but I'm glad you had a good time and hope you're not hurt 😅
03.03.24, 17:33 - Niki: I crash myself into the floor. But also exhausted but all good now. But also all good with crash got schooled really nice and sweet of the others
03.03.24, 17:34 - Niki: Tell you more tonight
03.03.24, 17:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
03.03.24, 17:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just out of curiosity, is it a coincidence that you liked the ones that were the most 'proper' more than the ones that show some more skin?
03.03.24, 17:44 - Niki: Nope not really
03.03.24, 17:44 - Niki: Or mabye unconscious
03.03.24, 17:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, I just noticed a pattern so I was curious
03.03.24, 21:58 - Niki: Okay in bed now ready to text abit or fall asleep very fast
03.03.24, 21:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Choose but choose wisely in that case
03.03.24, 22:01 - Niki: Will go too sleep just really tired 😅
03.03.24, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay 🥲
03.03.24, 22:01 - Niki: Goodnight my love ❤️
03.03.24, 22:02 - Niki: Will text you tomorrow
03.03.24, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Rude but okay
03.03.24, 22:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight then hon 💜
03.03.24, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you're gonna tease me by saying we can text and then go to sleep like that then I expect at least a shit ton of pictures tomorrow <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
03.03.24, 22:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because that is just plain rude
03.03.24, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just leaving me hanging like that...
03.03.24, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I could say so many things about this 🙄
03.03.24, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Germany fucking sucks at athletics btw
03.03.24, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just in case you care
04.03.24, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: At least have the decency to wait until I respond to your message?? No? I responded within the same minute and you just poofed already <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
04.03.24, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just up and disappear why don't yah
04.03.24, 00:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Leaving me to know nothing at all
04.03.24, 00:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: God knows you might have a freaking concussion and you never wake up and then what
04.03.24, 00:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Diese Nachricht wurde gelöscht.
04.03.24, 00:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's just called being a fucking tease <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
04.03.24, 00:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or dead
04.03.24, 00:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I wouldn't know which of two because I know nothing
04.03.24, 01:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And yes okay you were tired I get that but it still made me feel bad because you said you would text me in the evening and then when it was evening you said you could either text for a bit (and honestly I wouldn't have cared if it was only 5 mins) or fall asleep really fast. And as usual, you chose to go to sleep over talking to me and without even looking at my goodnight message back or anything, which gave me the idea that you clearly never are excited to talk to me about anything like I am usually excited to talk to you (yes overthinking but why the hell do you think I'm still awake right now?)
And I debated not telling you about this because this probably will ruin your day but then again you do tell me to tell you how I feel so here you have it. <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
04.03.24, 01:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do hope you still have a lovely day though
04.03.24, 06:35 - Niki: Sorry hon its shitty i realized that right now and i feel really bad. 1000 times sorry and yes you will get alot of pictures.
04.03.24, 06:37 - Niki: No please tell me how you feel and what i mean or what my words do to you. I wanna know because sometimes i dont see in that way emotionally or the meaning / how they make you feel
04.03.24, 08:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon ☀️
04.03.24, 08:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks for trying to see things from my perspective 😊
04.03.24, 11:11 - Niki: Always
04.03.24, 11:11 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
04.03.24, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wow
04.03.24, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's amazing
04.03.24, 13:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wish I could see that with my own eyes
04.03.24, 16:19 - Niki: Its really crazy and alot of belgium / Netherlands also here so mabye we go here together at some point
04.03.24, 16:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm
04.03.24, 16:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If that's what you'd like maybe
04.03.24, 17:09 - Niki: Dont need to if you dont wanted to learn how to ski. We can also just hik and look at the mountains
04.03.24, 17:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would love to learn how to ski
04.03.24, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm still waiting for those pictures btw
04.03.24, 17:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That AND/OR if god is willing, perhaps even you telling me how and what you've been doing the last couple of days
04.03.24, 17:40 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Only if you actually want to talk to me though, I don't want to burden you with this
04.03.24, 17:41 - Niki: You dont burden me at all hon 😘
04.03.24, 17:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still interesting how you really only ever tell me about your day when I ask you to
04.03.24, 17:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I've been having an anxiety attack for pretty much all of today and maybe you can tell that my overthinking of yesterday hasn't stopped yet, I shouldn't be talking to you like this
04.03.24, 17:53 - Niki: My day is going great. We been ski like the last 2 days. Like a day here is planned like:
Waking up at 7:00 eat breakfast for
Then we get to the lift around at 8:30 or so
Then sking until breakfast on the hut at 13 then skiing till
We get back down around 16
Then back down shower eat and bed
04.03.24, 17:58 - Niki: Sorry to hear the kinda wanna call later if you want to?
04.03.24, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds intensive but I honestly don't really care about your itinerary, I wanna know how things are going, if you're all getting along with everyone, do you have roommates? How's that going if you do? Idk, what kind of pistes are you skiing on? How's it hanging out with Marco?
04.03.24, 17:59 - Niki: Yeah no we get along they are nice its kinda like a school trip
04.03.24, 17:59 - Niki: Yeah marco is my roommate
04.03.24, 18:00 - Niki: Only blue i am shit at ski again its crazy
04.03.24, 18:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know if that's a great idea, I'm having a full blown mental health episode and I've been contemplating closing myself off from the world all day. It's not pretty or good and I don't want to bring down your mood
04.03.24, 18:02 - Niki: You talking with your parents about or alex/jinte?
04.03.24, 18:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No
04.03.24, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's not like I can actually close off, I'm meeting with some people tomorrow
04.03.24, 18:06 - Niki: Okay omw to the shopping store text you back in abit
04.03.24, 18:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: k
04.03.24, 18:19 - Niki: You wanna text tonight?

04.03.24, 18:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you're not too tired we can, but I guess there's no real difference in calling or texting so whatever you prefer
04.03.24, 18:27 - Niki: I would probably text around 21?
04.03.24, 18:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
04.03.24, 20:32 - Niki: We eat late could we text at 22
04.03.24, 20:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ca va

04.03.24, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What was for dinner?
04.03.24, 20:59 - Niki: Pasta with tomatoes soup not really but like the think wait
04.03.24, 21:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Huh, sounds kinda weird, like vermicellis or really just normal spaghetti pasta?
04.03.24, 21:01 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
04.03.24, 21:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay then, hope it tasted good
04.03.24, 21:02 - Niki: Meh was okay
04.03.24, 21:02 - Niki: How was your dinner hon?
04.03.24, 21:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Are you all taking turns cooking or how does it work?
04.03.24, 21:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was okay, pizza
04.03.24, 21:03 - Niki: Yes. We every "couple" needs to cook for one day and 2 days are still open because nothing is planned there yet
04.03.24, 21:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you and your fiancée cooking?
04.03.24, 21:04 - Niki: Marco and me 😅made pizza
04.03.24, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: frozen or from scratch?
04.03.24, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I may or may not be judging a lot depending on the answer I am assuming
04.03.24, 21:05 - Niki: "Made" everybody put ther own things on there
Bought the "floor?"
04.03.24, 21:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh
04.03.24, 21:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, I guess that's okay
04.03.24, 21:06 - Niki: How was your day?
04.03.24, 21:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not good
04.03.24, 21:07 - Niki: Tell me more where did not good start?
04.03.24, 21:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Bit better now because my mom came home and practically forced me to put my shoes and coat on and literally pushed me out the door to take a walk, but still not amazing
04.03.24, 21:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yesterday :)
04.03.24, 21:08 - Niki: Good job from your mom and thank her from me 🤗
04.03.24, 21:09 - Niki: Yeah i am still sorry and also thaught about alot today. My tried mind just went to the stupid ways of possibilities
04.03.24, 21:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I woke up feeling shitty because of overthinking, then found out I was not gonna make it to class on time, more overthinking, more overthinking, found out my second class wasn't happening because my teacher was sick, more overthinking, finally managed to drag myself out of bed and into the shower at 14, almost fainted, ate food, tried to do something for school and follow class but that didn't really work well because it was online and boring as fuck, and then more overthinking
04.03.24, 21:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was also just really shitty timing though. On any other day it wouldn't have been an issue, just yesterday (and possible if it happened today too) because of how I was already feeling
04.03.24, 21:11 - Niki: Ah i see. Man i feel bad sorry again and again. Should have send you some more texts from stopping over thinks 🥲
04.03.24, 21:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda hard to ski and text though I would guess
04.03.24, 21:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Though would have appreciated the pictures you promised me this morning :/
04.03.24, 21:14 - Niki: Yeah really shitty time form me fucking up. Please dont thinks at any point in time that you did something wrong about the way your feeling at the moment it just happens at times. But i sadly also not there i am just assuming the worst
04.03.24, 21:15 - Niki: Sorry just being weird about asking someone for a picture or taking a selfie with the group
04.03.24, 21:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think you knew how I was feeling already at that point though, but yeah, what happened happened
04.03.24, 21:16 - Niki: Still feeling "anti social"
Best way i think i can discribe it
04.03.24, 21:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey... are you telling me no one in the whole group that is there with you is taking any pictures whatsoever?
04.03.24, 21:17 - Niki: Yes they are but feeling weird to ask them to send me the picture. They one make a Google docs foldee for the at the end.
04.03.24, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think you mean "german"
04.03.24, 21:18 - Niki: Well yeah only to new people. If somebody brings a friend them mabye thats okay but thats the line
04.03.24, 21:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But if you don't feel comfortable sending pictures, at least tell me something interesting that happened, all I'm doing is going to classes while you're in fucking Austria in gorgeous mountains with a whole group of friends and you don't tell me anything that is happening 😅
04.03.24, 21:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Man, my parents asked how you're doing and all I could say was "Okay I think? He said he fell once" and that was it
04.03.24, 21:20 - Niki: Ahhhh
04.03.24, 21:20 - Niki: I cant think of things
04.03.24, 21:20 - Niki: Wait
04.03.24, 21:23 - Niki: I am getting back into sky its a complete different level. I am mostly driving the blue lines. Which are the easy ones
04.03.24, 21:24 - Niki: Every day somebody goes with me one the blue lines. Sometimes we split up but allways get together for lunch.
04.03.24, 21:25 - Niki: I am sorry for them but i keep saying that they could leaf me be. I will keep training
04.03.24, 21:25 - Niki: Today it was marco flo and Niklas. Really nice and learned me abit more about it.
04.03.24, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They are all that much better?
04.03.24, 21:26 - Niki: Yes by far
04.03.24, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, that's interesting
04.03.24, 21:26 - Niki: Its been way too long since last time i went
04.03.24, 21:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: When was the last time?
04.03.24, 21:26 - Niki: 2017/18
04.03.24, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 6-7 years ago... yeah that's a long time for sure
04.03.24, 21:27 - Niki: Yeah sadly
04.03.24, 21:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Who do you get along with best in the group (other than your fiancee obviously)
04.03.24, 21:28 - Niki: Probably flo because i know him a while now, then maybe nici. But they are all nice. Its also not getting weird talking to them <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
04.03.24, 21:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How do you know all of them actually? I'm glad it's not weird talking to them
04.03.24, 21:29 - Niki: Not sure could also be Philipp or Niklas because they help me alot for the skiing
04.03.24, 21:30 - Niki: Most of them though marco meet them a few time(mabye 3 or so). Some never see
04.03.24, 21:30 - Niki: But they are nice people
04.03.24, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good, maybe you have some new friends you can hang out with after the trip
04.03.24, 21:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (if you have time for that)
04.03.24, 21:32 - Niki: Don't think so they also live in Dresden which is a hour away so no i don't think so
04.03.24, 21:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Weren't you thinking of moving there with Alex though?
04.03.24, 21:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And can I kindly remind you that most of your friends now live in Leipzig which is also an hour away?
04.03.24, 21:33 - Niki: Yeah then mabye but eh will see
04.03.24, 21:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind fabian, who lives in freaking Potsdam
04.03.24, 21:34 - Niki: Yes but making new friends in your 20s is harder
04.03.24, 21:34 - Niki: Keep the old ones you know
04.03.24, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which is why this is a great opportunity to do so if you feel like it but yeah, I guess I get what you mean
04.03.24, 21:35 - Niki: Yeah it's crazy
04.03.24, 21:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing wrong with making some good connections and trying to keep them up though, even if they're people you only see once a year
04.03.24, 21:35 - Niki: Yeah mabye we will see
04.03.24, 21:36 - Niki: How it develops
04.03.24, 21:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair
04.03.24, 21:36 - Niki: Also sking expensive as fuck
04.03.24, 21:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No shit
04.03.24, 21:37 - Niki: 400 euro only for the ticket for the " mount train think "
04.03.24, 21:37 - Niki: For 7 days
04.03.24, 21:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: mount train think? you mean the skilift?
04.03.24, 21:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fuck that's expensive
04.03.24, 21:38 - Niki: Yeah they are multiple and its over a few hundred kilometers
04.03.24, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay but that is interesting and kind of understandable though
04.03.24, 21:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Those things have got to be difficult and often in upkeep
04.03.24, 21:38 - Niki: Yeah but its alot
04.03.24, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Clearly it is fucking insanely expensive but yeah, what do you do about it?
04.03.24, 21:39 - Niki: Nothing really 😅
04.03.24, 21:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yup
04.03.24, 21:41 - Niki: And the otherstuff is also crazy like i am sure i will spend at least 1.2 to 1.5 k for everything. Including wearable thinks toi
04.03.24, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Holy fuck
04.03.24, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Where in god's name did you get that money from
04.03.24, 21:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's more expensive than our two weeks in Portugal??
04.03.24, 21:42 - Niki: Well i could lend some of the wearable thinks from my uncle and moms friends. But its probably still around there some where
04.03.24, 21:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Jesus christ
04.03.24, 21:43 - Niki: Like
Food 200
Skipass 400
Renting Ski 200
Housing 150
Helmed and glasses 200
04.03.24, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My god
04.03.24, 21:44 - Niki: Its crazy
04.03.24, 21:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, noted, if I ever want to go skiing I need a lot of money
04.03.24, 21:44 - Niki: Yes😅
04.03.24, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe I can get a student job next year so I can save up for the next  years, maybe then I'll get there
04.03.24, 21:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: *3 years
04.03.24, 21:45 - Niki: Mabye that can help
04.03.24, 21:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I would hope so
04.03.24, 21:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Can I ask you a question I might not want the answer to?
04.03.24, 21:48 - Niki: Yeah sure
04.03.24, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is what kind of spiralled my mental health crash yesterday
04.03.24, 21:48 - Niki: Sure go on?
04.03.24, 21:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's the worst thing you have ever thought about me?
04.03.24, 21:48 - Niki: Mmmh
04.03.24, 21:50 - Niki: No idea to be honest you are saved in my mind as a really unreasonable perfect person.
04.03.24, 21:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's just really hard to believe you know?
04.03.24, 21:50 - Niki: Some small thinks but we all have that. And its normal
04.03.24, 21:51 - Niki: ITS NORMAL too feel weird sometimes and its fine. I still love you. If your overthinking hon
04.03.24, 21:52 - Niki: Never thought bad about you
04.03.24, 21:53 - Niki: What you think?
04.03.24, 21:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think you understand why that question caused me to spiral though. It is because my own answer to that question is a bit different
04.03.24, 21:53 - Niki: Tell me more?
04.03.24, 21:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The worst thing that I ever thought about you was yesterday and it's really nothing negative about you as a person
04.03.24, 21:54 - Niki: I don't know if i wanna know now
04.03.24, 21:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It is just that I am jealous and scared of all the opportunities you have to forget about me
04.03.24, 21:54 - Niki: Oh okay yeah no will never happen
04.03.24, 21:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will take your word for it then
04.03.24, 21:57 - Niki: Don't worry hon
I only sleep with you (and marco at the moment) 😘
Love you
04.03.24, 21:57 - Niki: I will go to sleep now with marco
04.03.24, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You really do have shitty timing going to sleep don't yah?
04.03.24, 21:58 - Niki: Goodnight hon❤️
By thw way i already told most of them about you because of the belgiums that ate here
04.03.24, 21:58 - Niki: Sorry really sorry
04.03.24, 21:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you too
04.03.24, 21:59 - Niki: Your cute and i hope you can trust me i will not disappoint
04.03.24, 21:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I will tolerate you sleeping with your fiancee but at least get a picture with him at some point this week or you will regret not having that memory
04.03.24, 21:59 - Niki: Because you will overthinking that i am sure of
04.03.24, 22:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also don't think you understand that I'm really really not afraid of you cheating on me
04.03.24, 22:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's not even what I meant with the forgetting part
04.03.24, 22:00 - Niki: Oh ups sorry misunderstanding that then
04.03.24, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I probably should have explained that a bit more sorry
04.03.24, 22:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I meant it in really just the most basic meaning of forgetting, letting go, not remembering, not looking back for me
04.03.24, 22:02 - Niki: I am allways thinking about you while skiing no worrys just busy here
04.03.24, 22:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know you are busy and I don't mind it, you should be busy and not concerned with me the whole time
04.03.24, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But that was how I was thinking and feeling already last night before you went to sleep so quickly
04.03.24, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't want you to say sorry about this again
04.03.24, 22:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What happened happened
04.03.24, 22:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just saying this to explain
04.03.24, 22:05 - Niki: Okay hon the just saying
 love you 💙
04.03.24, 22:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you too muffin ❤
04.03.24, 22:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Now can we end today on a bit of a happier note? I don't want to keep you up too long but I also don't want to go when just talking about this
04.03.24, 22:06 - Niki: Okay any ideas?
04.03.24, 22:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, Moustache has almost learned how to manipulate my dad into giving him second dinner?
04.03.24, 22:08 - Niki: Okay how did he do that? Smart that i thaught he would?
04.03.24, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, he just meowed a lot and then stared at his food bowl very sadly
04.03.24, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And my dad was almost convinced
04.03.24, 22:09 - Niki: Smart boy
04.03.24, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But he thankfully asked me if he already had food
04.03.24, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I thwarted his plan
04.03.24, 22:10 - Niki: Good job but also kinda sad that he didn't get it
04.03.24, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also have a really busy day tomorrow and I'm not sure I will be able to handle it but I will try
04.03.24, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He doesn't need to get more fluffy than he already is
04.03.24, 22:11 - Niki: You got this hon i believe in it
04.03.24, 22:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You don't even know what I have to do so how would you know?
04.03.24, 22:12 - Niki: Just believing in you
04.03.24, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhu, okay
04.03.24, 22:14 - Niki: Can i not?
04.03.24, 22:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, I guess you can, but it doesn't make a lot of sense
04.03.24, 22:15 - Niki: 😋 Nope but do i make sense most of the time
04.03.24, 22:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would you also believe in me if I would be the first untrained astronaut to go into space?
04.03.24, 22:15 - Niki: If you want to be?
04.03.24, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because I wouldn't if that were you, no offense, I would try to talk you out of it until you were up in space
04.03.24, 22:16 - Niki: I could try believe in you helping you
04.03.24, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Being untrained and in space is a bad combo
04.03.24, 22:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Has nothing to do with capabilities and determination outside of that
04.03.24, 22:16 - Niki: Well you would be wanting to train if you wanna go right?
04.03.24, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's why I specified untrained
04.03.24, 22:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yes, however I do have a big fear of space so chances of me going up there alive and conscious are very very slim
04.03.24, 22:17 - Niki: Okay i see well in that case i would mabye over think believing in you
04.03.24, 22:18 - Niki: Whats up for tomorrow?
04.03.24, 22:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Social interaction
04.03.24, 22:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So much fucking social interaction
04.03.24, 22:18 - Niki: Okay in that i do belive in you
04.03.24, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: First I have to do a pitch to the teacher, then Laeticia is coming over, then I'm introducing Laeticia to Alex, then I have a class, and then I am going out for dinner with Celine and Julia (and perhaps some of her friends idk)
04.03.24, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Julia is someone who was also in Norway btw
04.03.24, 22:20 - Niki: Ah okay yeah thats alot. You got it 💙 or just get through it which every way you wanna see it 😅😘
04.03.24, 22:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know if I will survive tomorrow but will let you know if I do I guess
04.03.24, 22:21 - Niki: Tell me how the meeting between alex and laeaticia was?
04.03.24, 22:21 - Niki: Please do that too 😘 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>

04.03.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will do, I promised Alex to introduce them because otherwise she has no one to go to facts with 😅
04.03.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will try
04.03.24, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, do you still get all my locket pictures? Because some of them disappeared when I look at it and it's weird
04.03.24, 22:23 - Niki: Goodnight hon love you and try to sleep abit early today and hope you don't over think tonight and tomorrow(either way you dont have time for that 😋)
04.03.24, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I will try to go to sleep soon but no promises on actually sleeping though.
04.03.24, 22:24 - Niki: Yeah its kinda weird i see some but not all. Think we need to test it out over call at some point
04.03.24, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight muffin, sweet dreams ❤️

05.03.24, 13:03 - Niki: Sounds like alex is a problem 😅
05.03.24, 13:03 - Niki: Hope you still have fun with the both of them and they klick
05.03.24, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nah, just more people 😅

05.03.24, 16:35 - Niki: Hope you can refill
05.03.24, 16:39 - Niki: Great skinning and shower. Got better and better today. Probably will not go skiing tomorrow with some others.
05.03.24, 16:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Taking a day to rest? Probably a good idea. How do your muscles feel after skiing so much the last couple of days?
05.03.24, 16:44 - Niki: Abit sore but its okay
05.03.24, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Class is over, bit of a rest now and then I'm going to Celine's 😅

06.03.24, 09:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon ☀️
06.03.24, 09:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I might have to stay a day longer when I come over, my train ride back was just cancelled and I can't get an alternative because of strikes 😅 but will see what happens still, it's not clear yet
06.03.24, 09:23 - Niki: Sounds great🥰 glad to hear that.

06.03.24, 09:57 - Niki: I don't know nothing big /interesting happened. 😅 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
06.03.24, 09:57 - Niki: Internet is still bad
06.03.24, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nothing interesting happened for me either, just was fun
06.03.24, 10:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I wouldn't think it would just casually get better randomly
06.03.24, 10:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Reminded me a lot of Norway though
06.03.24, 10:10 - Niki: Nice to hear how are the other friends of Celine?
06.03.24, 10:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're nice
06.03.24, 10:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What kind of drinking games did you play?
06.03.24, 10:13 - Niki: "Busfahrer" mostly and shot every now and then
06.03.24, 10:14 - Niki: By the way Norway on of the people here goes to Trondheim next year for his Erasmus

06.03.24, 10:15 - Niki: You geuss and drink can explain it to you later or when your over. Kinda hard over text
06.03.24, 10:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's nice!

06.03.24, 10:32 - Niki: Yeah but also woke up at 7 so meh
06.03.24, 10:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same, but tried to go back to sleep until 9, didn't work out so well, woke up every 5 mins
06.03.24, 10:33 - Niki: Damm okay good luck coming through the day
06.03.24, 10:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I learned how to make Tortilla de papas yesterday, I think you might like it

06.03.24, 10:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Normally yeah, but will see how he is tonight
06.03.24, 11:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://open.spotify.com/track/0otRX6Z89qKkHkQ9OqJpKt?si=7GTy4OohSgimpGIBTXw_CQ
06.03.24, 12:52 - Niki: Huh? Nice song?
06.03.24, 12:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Did you ever look at the lyrics?
06.03.24, 12:56 - Niki: I will not load need to get to a new place
06.03.24, 13:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time
I'm sayin', "See you again, " so many times, it's becoming my tagline
But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
Than try to catch this flight
So many things I'd rather say
But for now, it's goodbye
You say I'm always leavin'
You, when you're sleepin' alone
But the, the car's outside
But I don't wanna go tonight
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags
You're comin' with me
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows, lock the doors
Don't wanna leave you anymore
Oh-oh, ah
I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel
It's an unfamiliar feelin' but I know it so well
Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
Than this mobile in my hand
But I guess it'll do, 'cause for you
I would run up my phone bill
You say I'm always leavin'
You, when you need me the most
But the, the car's outside
But I don't wanna go tonight
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags
You're comin' with me
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows, lock the doors
Don't wanna leave you anymore
Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah
Don't wanna leave you anymore
Oh, darling, all of the city lights
Never shine as bright as your eyes
I would trade them all for a minute more
But the car's outside
And he's called me twice
But he's gonna have to wait tonight
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags
You're comin' with me
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows, lock the doors
Don't wanna leave you anymore
Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah
No, I don't wanna leave you anymore
I don't wanna leave you
(Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
(Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
Don't wanna leave you anymore
06.03.24, 13:22 - Niki: Cutie feel that song text
06.03.24, 13:29 - Niki: New favorite song?
06.03.24, 13:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, don't have any favourites right now, but I thought I should send it to you
06.03.24, 14:07 - Niki: Still cant read your messages on locked thing
06.03.24, 14:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then how can you answer/do you know I sent one? That doesn't make sense
06.03.24, 14:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Something is really off with the app then
06.03.24, 14:13 - Niki: I see them as a notification but cant see them on the app
06.03.24, 14:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Weird
06.03.24, 14:28 - Niki: Yes also i am feeling really exhausted today. Dont know if its the socializing or drinking yesterday? But i dont have any energy <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
06.03.24, 14:29 - Niki: How is your day going so far hon?
06.03.24, 14:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You've been doing a lot of sports and then socialising + drinking could definitely make you really tired
06.03.24, 14:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Could be worse, could be better, but not productive at all so far
06.03.24, 14:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Rest up and drink enough water
06.03.24, 14:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Diese Nachricht wurde gelöscht.
06.03.24, 15:56 - Niki: Yeah think so too
06.03.24, 15:56 - Niki: Whats the meesage you deleted?
06.03.24, 15:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Something I don't want to talk about over text, but nothing bad
06.03.24, 16:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just having a hard time feeling connected to you lately, but there's not a lot we can do about that now. I'm just thinking of ways to improve that.
I don't know if you feel the same way or if that is just me. I'm just having a hard time dealing with the distance right now
06.03.24, 16:03 - Niki: Okay
06.03.24, 16:05 - Niki: Yeah no get what you mean. Also think its something to talk about with a call?
06.03.24, 16:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I think so too, would be better in person but that's still a while 🥲
06.03.24, 16:06 - Niki: Yeah you okay with pushing it back a bit?
06.03.24, 16:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Until I come to Germany you mean?
06.03.24, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because that's still almost a month and I'm not sure it would be a good idea to wait until then, even if it would be better to talk about it in person
06.03.24, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But we can definitely wait until next week (for obvious reasons) <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
06.03.24, 16:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I really fucking love you, even when I'm having a hard time feeling connected to you because of the distance 💜
06.03.24, 16:14 - Niki: Okay love you too and cant thibg if my life right now with out you ❤️
06.03.24, 16:14 - Niki: Okay next week sounds good
06.03.24, 18:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you and all the things you are made out of
06.03.24, 18:48 - Niki: Love you too my love
06.03.24, 21:57 - Niki: Goodnight rabbit 🧡
06.03.24, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my lovely goose 💜
06.03.24, 22:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope your day was nice and that your dreams will be sweeter 😘
06.03.24, 22:16 - Niki: Cutie hope soo too for you ❤️
06.03.24, 23:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm gonna say something that might not make any sense whatsoever, or maybe it makes a lot of sense, but telling you about the disconnect I feel has made me feel a lot more connected already? It's weird but it definitely feels like a relief even though I was definitely crying while we were texting about it earlier today. I don't like talking about this kind of stuff when you're out doing things with your friends and yet it always seems to be in those moments when I feel the worst, that timing is a working point of mine, but being able to talk to you when I need to is something I really really appreciate and love about you. Only one of many things of course 😘
06.03.24, 23:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hope when you feel bad or when you need/want something from me, you feel comfortable asking and talking to me about it too <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
06.03.24, 23:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me be your safe haven when you need it
06.03.24, 23:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We should still talk about it next week of course, I just want to let you know I appreciate you and your willingness to deal with my emotional bullshit 😅
But I feel like a conversation about this, while not great in it being online still, will be good to hear how you feel about things
07.03.24, 00:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And while I do feel more connected already, I'd like to fully reconnect in whatever way that's possible and try to make it so neither of us experiences this feeling in the future. Distance sucks but we'll be okay in spite of it 💜
07.03.24, 06:39 - Niki: Read it
Got it
Will text you back abit later
Going to a different mountain today need to be fast 😘
Love you 🧡
07.03.24, 08:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun 😘 love you too ❤️ no need to rush
07.03.24, 08:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And good morning hon ☀️
07.03.24, 22:02 - Niki: Sorry forgot my phone today at the airbnb
07.03.24, 22:02 - Niki: Just got back from skiing and then a nice dinner at a hotel near the mountains
07.03.24, 22:05 - Niki: About your texts totally get your feelings especially when i am on a holiday and dont text as much. The skiing trip is also way more time consuming then i thought to be honest. Its like spending time with the group every waking minute. Its not something bad just alot sometimes. <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
07.03.24, 22:06 - Niki: Will definitely talk about it at somepoint after the holiday. Also glad it help sending me the texts so you got it out and i love reading even if its something "bad" or not "good news". Please keep texting me in these kinds of moments 🙏🏼💙. I am also not sure how i gonna survive the next two days because they are packed with nice stuff todo which we planed along the way mabye just abit lot <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
07.03.24, 22:07 - Niki: Goodnight my love hope you have a great night 🥰
07.03.24, 22:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: All day or just this afternoon?
07.03.24, 22:20 - Niki: All day forgot it on the mountain too
07.03.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I did think it was gonna be a lot, but it has also been something on my mind before the trip, but yeah, we can talk about it later. But yeah, a group trip is a lot anyway.
07.03.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Weird, it says on my phone you read my messages around 12
07.03.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You'll live, enjoy all you can
07.03.24, 22:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight hon ❤️
07.03.24, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sweet dreams 😘
07.03.24, 22:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (just getting on a tram now)
07.03.24, 22:23 - Niki: 12? Really weird
07.03.24, 22:24 - Niki: But i am also getting notifications from like yesterday again today. Dont know if WhatsApp is fuck here or just the internet in general
07.03.24, 22:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
07.03.24, 22:24 - Niki: Belive you just weird
07.03.24, 22:25 - Niki: Get home savely 💙
07.03.24, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't know either, but on Tuesday a bunch of things were out, like Instagram and messenger
07.03.24, 22:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: With my parents, will be fine
07.03.24, 22:25 - Niki: Okay. Love you ❤️
07.03.24, 22:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too 💜
07.03.24, 22:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But do try to send me something please? Even when you're really busy?
07.03.24, 22:28 - Niki: I will try too
07.03.24, 22:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If it doesn't take too much time
07.03.24, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and because you asked about my day (not), was okay, just went to dinner with my parents, aunt, Pieter and one of Pieter's friends who moved to the US to be with his fiancee. They did long distance for a while too. He offered me some advice. Cool guy, constantly on his phone but makes sense because his fiancee is awake right now <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
07.03.24, 22:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This advice was kinda bullshit but oh well
07.03.24, 22:41 - Niki: Sorry wanted to believe me
07.03.24, 22:52 - Niki: But still nice dinner?
What was thw advice?
07.03.24, 22:52 - Niki: Forgot to send again ahhhhh
07.03.24, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just wanted to talk about my day, I was trying to joke about it but I probably shouldn't 😅
07.03.24, 22:53 - Niki: Goodnight hon will read tomorrow sorry🙏🏼
07.03.24, 22:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The food was meh but company was great so yeah. His advice was to get married
07.03.24, 22:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure okay, goodnight ❤️
07.03.24, 23:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Diese Nachricht wurde gelöscht.
08.03.24, 06:47 - Niki: Good morning my love hope you had a good night 😘
08.03.24, 06:48 - Niki: Sounds like a plan i geuss. But works in Amerika for the Greencatd and everything
08.03.24, 08:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon ☀️ I dreamt about you, but weird dream again so yeah, was a pretty good night. Hope yours was good too
08.03.24, 08:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a plan?? Yeah, when he found out you were from Germany he was like "oh, in that case it isn't even necessary for the visa, but still makes things easier" 😅
08.03.24, 08:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Although I did wake up feeling nauseous in the middle of the night so maybe not that great. But you kissed me on my cheek in my dream, so that makes it better
08.03.24, 08:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You weren't allowed to actually kiss me because I was single for a day but then I said yes to someone with a profile picture of a dog on accident so I felt bad. Oh, and I also dreamt I called you while you were still sleeping and you just picked up and went back to sleep so I just did the same
08.03.24, 11:58 - Niki: Damm okay interesting dreams for sure. Love the kiss on your cheeks 🥰
08.03.24, 12:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I still need an explanation for the "sounds like a plan I guess"
08.03.24, 12:02 - Niki: Well its a plan not a really good one or one e will follow but a plan i geuss?
08.03.24, 12:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That makes more sense but it is a confusing way to say it 😅
08.03.24, 12:03 - Niki: Yeah was early 😅
08.03.24, 12:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Fair enough
08.03.24, 12:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How was the different mountain yesterday?
08.03.24, 12:14 - Niki: Was nice but abit bumpy
08.03.24, 12:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Same mountain today?
08.03.24, 12:24 - Niki: Nope we going to the one we normally go too. But today is snowboard training aka first time
08.03.24, 12:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds cool, try not to fall on your face
08.03.24, 12:25 - Niki: Try my best
08.03.24, 14:59 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
08.03.24, 15:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very cute doggo
08.03.24, 15:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No snowboarding though?
08.03.24, 15:05 - Niki: Yeah done for today i am really exhausted its crazy. My legs feel like slime
08.03.24, 15:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Damn, that's early, snowboarding is that hard?
08.03.24, 15:11 - Niki: For me yeah its crazy. I feel weak really weak 😅. I think its like everything all about training and doing it more often
08.03.24, 15:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably yeah
08.03.24, 15:13 - Niki: Gone take a shower now. Text you in a bit 😘
08.03.24, 15:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Everyone else is still going though?
08.03.24, 15:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Without me? Rude
08.03.24, 15:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 😘
08.03.24, 15:26 - Niki: Cutie 🥰
08.03.24, 15:26 - Niki: Yeah they all still up the mountain
08.03.24, 15:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Maybe we should do some more sports on a daily basis
08.03.24, 15:27 - Niki: Yes definitely 😅
08.03.24, 15:28 - Niki: How is your day going my love 😘
08.03.24, 15:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Going alright, my meeting this morning was good, I like my group for that project a lot so far. In class now but it's meh. Gonna go to a protest with Alex later
08.03.24, 15:30 - Niki: What's the protest about?
08.03.24, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: International Women's Day
08.03.24, 15:30 - Niki: Your day sounds produktiv and nice hope it goes on like that
08.03.24, 15:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks hon 😘
08.03.24, 15:30 - Niki: Okay so against it or for it or in what way?
08.03.24, 15:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For it, it's to talk about how there's still no full equality, how things seem to be getting worse in a lot of places instead of better
08.03.24, 15:31 - Niki: Ah okay so more for womans rights?
08.03.24, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, kinda
08.03.24, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Will be interesting because my thesis I'm writing now is on the wage gap
08.03.24, 15:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And my bachelor thesis was on female entrepreneurs
08.03.24, 15:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pretty sure my master's thesis will be on a similar theme if things keep turning out this way 😅
08.03.24, 15:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (I didn't get to choose the topics in either of the times)
08.03.24, 15:34 - Niki: Nice import protest. Dont burn down the city 😅
08.03.24, 15:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries, it's a peaceful protest
08.03.24, 15:34 - Niki: Yeah i know its kinda crazy that ypu could just had choices 😅
08.03.24, 15:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, but oh well, so be it. It is quite interesting so I don't mind it too much
08.03.24, 15:35 - Niki: Yeah would think so
08.03.24, 15:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also interesting info I found today is that the wage gap in East Germany is 7% lower than in West Germany
08.03.24, 15:36 - Niki: Yeah it's crazy
08.03.24, 15:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which is why I'm gonna be looking into the effect of political history on flexibility at work and the wage gap 😅
08.03.24, 15:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's really cool
08.03.24, 15:36 - Niki: Nice
08.03.24, 15:36 - Niki: Dont say that outloud in Germany east
08.03.24, 15:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No it is! I would have thought it would be the opposite but you guys are doing a lot better than the West part
08.03.24, 15:36 - Niki: Gonna take a nap now though really tired
08.03.24, 15:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, sweet dreams 😴💜

09.03.24, 18:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's the bachelor thesis group

09.03.24, 18:58 - Niki: Okay doing okay in them? How is math going by the way did have tutoring already?
09.03.24, 18:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, the guy hasn't responded to my email yet so kinda stuck with that. Math is not going great so far
09.03.24, 19:00 - Niki: Mmh okay🥲
09.03.24, 19:01 - Niki: In a bad way i assume or just special? <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
09.03.24, 19:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's annoying as fuck so far
09.03.24, 19:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not sure what else to think of it
09.03.24, 19:02 - Niki: Because they dont wanna work or special individuals?
09.03.24, 19:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just finding a time to meet up, also I have absolutely no clue about who these people are

09.03.24, 19:07 - Niki: Nice sounds great
09.03.24, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's just that they are a really really really clingy couple
09.03.24, 19:07 - Niki: Huh you know them?
09.03.24, 19:07 - Niki: Nevermind i typ to slow
09.03.24, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes, the girl went to high school with us and I met her bf yesterday
09.03.24, 19:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: They're nice people but the PDA is too much for me to handle
09.03.24, 19:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Would be fine if I was single but well, not the case so I'll just have to suck it up and deal with it
09.03.24, 19:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You just gonna relax in Gößnitz or driving back to Chemnitz?
09.03.24, 19:09 - Niki: Yeah no totally get that was happy that nici and Philip weren't like that 🙏🏼. Would have been a pain to see and feel jealous

09.03.24, 19:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Never done that before though so I will suck at it
09.03.24, 19:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like a plan
09.03.24, 19:16 - Niki: You got it 😘
09.03.24, 19:17 - Niki: By the way phone is about to die and we charge Marcos for the gps so gonna be off ubtil 22:30 sorry 🥲

09.03.24, 23:06 - Niki: Hope you have fun
09.03.24, 23:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Grazie
10.03.24, 02:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And it appears I am "single" because Alex is randomly making out with someone she met 5 mins ago... Help
10.03.24, 02:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Like good for her but holy  shit okay
10.03.24, 08:37 - Niki: Damm crazy. Good job wingwoman 👍🏻
10.03.24, 09:13 - Niki: Good morning my love
10.03.24, 09:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's too early for this shit
10.03.24, 09:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Neither me nor Alex did anything and honestly it was kind of annoying 😅
10.03.24, 09:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon
10.03.24, 09:15 - Niki: Sorry to hear that but didn't you wont to set her up with someone?
10.03.24, 09:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes but I also was there with only Alex and I was sober, so having Alex make out with someone for 10 minutes kinda left me standing alone in a corner rethinking life
10.03.24, 09:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I literally had to pull her away because someone else made a comment about it
10.03.24, 09:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And honestly... The girl literally walked up, asked if they could kiss and they did... Grounds to build a relationship? None that I can see but who knows
10.03.24, 09:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's up for today?
10.03.24, 09:40 - Niki: Yeah okay nevermind then 😅
10.03.24, 09:41 - Niki: Unpacking and sleep and relax abit

13.03.24, 00:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: After we talked on Sunday there were a couple of things still on my mind, but the one I am most curious about is if you ever feel like you're chasing me? Because from your reaction it seemed that way and I don't know, I just want to know if that's true
13.03.24, 08:24 - Niki: Yeah sometimes it feels like that. Its only over text but its still there you know
13.03.24, 09:18 - Niki: Good morning my love ❤️

13.03.24, 09:35 - Niki: Yeah but i thought it was just a ldr texting thing because it disappeared after calks and being together again
13.03.24, 09:35 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I miss you so so much too, wish I could be there with you hon 💜 only 2 more weeks and I'll be there though 😘
13.03.24, 09:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I get that, it's the same for me but I think it's still something that annoys you a bit no? I don't care if it's something you feel is unimportant, but if something is bothering you please tell me. Especially if it's things like our communication because as it turns out, both of us were kind of suffering from it
13.03.24, 09:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I love you hon, and I want this to last, so whatever is going on, talk to me, we'll figure it out
13.03.24, 09:39 - Niki: Yeah will tell you when i am feeling it again and its bothering me ❤️

14.03.24, 18:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She's been laying her bed for most of the day so I hope she feels better soon too 😅
14.03.24, 19:38 - Niki: Poor you
14.03.24, 19:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ?
14.03.24, 19:45 - Niki: Poor her sorry
14.03.24, 19:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, yeah, that makes more sense
14.03.24, 19:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and my dad drove over his laptop
14.03.24, 19:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: With his car
14.03.24, 19:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a great day today

14.03.24, 19:46 - Niki: Aren't there a lot of data on there
14.03.24, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He put his bag down, then thought he would put the car inside but forgot about his bag that was still there, drove over it, felt like it was weird, backed off (so drove over it again) and then found out
14.03.24, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Surprisingly the screen is broken but otherwise it still works
14.03.24, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good laptop
14.03.24, 19:47 - Niki: Damm nice surprised by that
14.03.24, 19:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, same

14.03.24, 19:51 - Niki: Nice on Netflix?
14.03.24, 19:51 - Niki: Can't Image the story
14.03.24, 19:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
14.03.24, 19:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Batshit insane probably

14.03.24, 19:54 - Niki: Sorry if that seems like a hint didn't mean it
14.03.24, 19:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No worries, I just also don't want to distract you too much when you're out
14.03.24, 19:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So have fun 😘
14.03.24, 19:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (you'd be totally justified in hinting at it though)
14.03.24, 19:57 - Niki: Yeah i know but that wasn't one just saying
14.03.24, 19:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, thanks for clarifying 💜
14.03.24, 21:57 - Niki: We may have a crazy deal for phase games tell you more tomorrow. We will also learn more tomorrow about it and if we do it

15.03.24, 11:40 - Niki: Same but why?
15.03.24, 11:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I had a meeting with the other groupwork now normally, but someone pointed out that would be useless because we need to do some individual work first
15.03.24, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I then ask if we can move it, 1 person reads it and no one responds to that
15.03.24, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So now I asked again if the meeting was gonna happen or not, no one reads it
15.03.24, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: So I have no fucking clue what is going on
15.03.24, 11:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How difficult is it to answer a damn text?
15.03.24, 11:45 - Niki: Feel you there and just dont go i geuss because you wrote it
15.03.24, 11:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's online but yeah, guess there will be no meeting
15.03.24, 12:13 - Niki: Yeah group works either work or are totally fucked
15.03.24, 12:13 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
15.03.24, 12:21 - Niki: Else how is the group except not communicating
15.03.24, 12:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No clue, we've had a meeting once so far
15.03.24, 12:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And they didn't say anything interesting
15.03.24, 12:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You play tennis???
15.03.24, 12:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds like the project is finally getting up to speed
15.03.24, 12:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope you make the deadline but this is really cool!!!
15.03.24, 12:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Congratulations!!! 🥳🍀
15.03.24, 12:35 - Niki: Table tennis

15.03.24, 12:36 - Niki: ^
15.03.24, 12:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ahhh, makes more sense
15.03.24, 13:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Apparently there's gonna be an xtc shop in Gent
15.03.24, 13:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For a public experiment
15.03.24, 13:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Subsidized by the government too, very interesting what they are going to try
15.03.24, 13:57 - Niki: Xtc?
15.03.24, 13:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The drug
15.03.24, 13:57 - Niki: Thc?

15.03.24, 13:58 - Niki: Okay never heard of them
15.03.24, 13:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ecstacy?
15.03.24, 13:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: MDMA?
15.03.24, 13:58 - Niki: Yeah know them
15.03.24, 14:00 - Niki: Okay interesting not sure if we will ever go in there
15.03.24, 14:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hahahah, they don't actually sell it
15.03.24, 14:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's an experiment to see how they can decriminalize the production, sale and use of xtc and other drugs
15.03.24, 14:08 - Niki: Ah okay need to explain it to me when you over. Not getting it full / having open question.
15.03.24, 14:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sure thing
15.03.24, 16:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I never want to leave Moustache alone again
15.03.24, 16:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom just left and he thought he was alone and he was yelling for someone 😭
15.03.24, 16:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He was yelling until he found me (after 3 minutes of yelling back and forth)
15.03.24, 16:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
15.03.24, 17:12 - Niki: Nice he enjoys it
15.03.24, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, he ran away, little traitor
15.03.24, 17:49 - Niki: Little sucker

15.03.24, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Red wine is not that bad
15.03.24, 22:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Bacardi coke is terrible though, but mainly because of the cola 😅
15.03.24, 22:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Tequila isn't bad either
16.03.24, 01:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aperol spritz was not good at first but now it's okay
16.03.24, 01:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I may be tipsy
16.03.24, 01:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But only just feeling it now
16.03.24, 01:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's a weird feeling
16.03.24, 01:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't think I like it
16.03.24, 04:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Got home, going to sleep now
16.03.24, 04:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight ❤️
16.03.24, 04:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I might not have been tipsy, but switching my glasses and the strobe lights sure made it feel that way
16.03.24, 04:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do know I don't have my mom's drinking genes though, which in itself is an interesting discovery
16.03.24, 08:05 - Niki: Glad you had a great night 😘.
Like red wine and bacardi coke for the rest of the tasts same
16.03.24, 10:05 - Niki: Its normal baking flower?

16.03.24, 11:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oven at 160°c
Make sure the flour doesn't stick together and add water to the honey so it becomes honeywater
Mix the eggs with a mixer or until very foamy. Add the sugar and keep mixing fast
Add the honey water and keep mixing for another 30 seconds.
Add the flour in 3 parts. Keep mixing.
Pour in a mold, add some extra honey on top and bake for 50 minutes. Let cool completely and enjoy
16.03.24, 11:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Eh, was okay
16.03.24, 12:07 - Niki: Ey?
16.03.24, 12:08 - Niki: How you feeling with yesterday and overall?
16.03.24, 12:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was nice, would do it again but maybe next time with Alex too because it kinda felt like 2 different friendgroups at times
16.03.24, 12:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also my butt/hips are sore from dancing which is kinda funny
16.03.24, 13:08 - Niki: Yeah think alex would be a nice addition.

16.03.24, 15:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you up to?
16.03.24, 15:31 - Niki: Nothing much either got thinks mostly done for today

16.03.24, 16:46 - Niki: How is your day going?
16.03.24, 16:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are the things you got from Marco's mom?
16.03.24, 16:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope your grandparents were proud
16.03.24, 16:49 - Niki: Cant remember what she calls them. Hoped you can help me 😅
16.03.24, 16:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alright, no energy for anything though. Also had an interesting chat with my parents about my lack of career drive
16.03.24, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well idk? The picture isn't very clear and I have no clue what's on the inside so
16.03.24, 16:50 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Kinda difficult
16.03.24, 16:50 - Niki: Yeah my grandma said it  look really good and i could ad almonds to it and in what way. Will make it again on thuesday
16.03.24, 16:51 - Niki: Yeah sorry we will see i geuss will bring them to the meet up on Wednesday or mabye eat the befor if i am hingry enough
16.03.24, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm still jealous of all the vacation time you have, to be able to say you will bake a cake again on Tuesday... I wish 🥲😅 I feel like I don't have enough time to do so on the weekend even 😅
16.03.24, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What meet up on Wednesday?
16.03.24, 16:52 - Niki: Huh tell me?
What did they say?
So just a relaxing day today?
16.03.24, 16:53 - Niki: Marco and the skiing group
16.03.24, 16:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No I have to do schoolwork for sure, but I'm stressed and procrastinating + no energy so idk
16.03.24, 16:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, meeting up again? That's cool
16.03.24, 16:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My mom was not impressed, my dad kind of understood I guess but not entirely
16.03.24, 16:53 - Niki: yeah after skiing we kinda wanted to meet up again
16.03.24, 16:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nice
16.03.24, 16:54 - Niki: Okay any solutions you came to or plan what todo?
16.03.24, 16:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, no need for solutions or plans
16.03.24, 16:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was just a conversation, nothing else
16.03.24, 16:58 - Niki: Okay is it weird thinking i could be a problem or a reason for that and feeling kinda bad about it? 

Just saying please think about your future i will gladly find away with you
16.03.24, 16:58 - Niki: Tell me if i am just overthinking
16.03.24, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This has nothing to do with you honestly. It's just that I don't find any satisfaction in thinking of being a director of any kind at whatever point in my life. I would rather work for a smaller company and have a good bond with my colleagues, get a smaller salary and things like that, than to work for a giant corporation and be stressed as fuck to go into work every day
16.03.24, 17:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And lately I don't have any ambitions of dreams for the future in context of work anyway, but that also has nothing to do with you.
16.03.24, 17:02 - Niki: Okay but you don't need to work in a big company and well mabye you find something if you try looking around abit more?
16.03.24, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It was mostly to do with the fact that I'm kind of studying something in the direction of working corporate so what is the point in me studying this if it isn't what I want to do for a job. But I don't know what I want to do so it's stupid
16.03.24, 17:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm not gonna not look around for jobs or anything just because I don't have specific dreams and ambitions of course. If I find a job I like then that's great, but it's just not something I put a lot of importance in at this point
16.03.24, 17:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't mind working corporate for a couple of years, make some good money, but I just don't think it's what I will end up liking
16.03.24, 17:07 - Niki: Okay well you can take your time with finding what you wanna do i aslong as you work as something and keep looking its all good. I will try to support you with that ❤️
Love you what ever you do and how much you make 😘
16.03.24, 17:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are your dreams/ambitions for work?
16.03.24, 17:10 - Niki: Own company would be nice but not necessarily and else probably working as a web- or gameprogrammer for some company <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
16.03.24, 17:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Those are nice ambitions to have
16.03.24, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I'll support you in those too 💜
16.03.24, 17:14 - Niki: Yeah just away i could see myself going forward
16.03.24, 17:14 - Niki: Thanks hon ❤️
16.03.24, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (the own company thing is pretty much accomplished though, just saying 😅)
16.03.24, 17:14 - Niki: Yeah but a actually good running one or a bit more strps i geuss
16.03.24, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Well... You can turn it into that if you want to?
16.03.24, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just saying, the goal isn't that far out of reach
16.03.24, 17:15 - Niki: We will try and see where it goes
16.03.24, 17:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair
16.03.24, 17:16 - Niki: Yeah know what you mean
16.03.24, 17:16 - Niki: Cutie ❤️
16.03.24, 17:16 - Niki: My grandparents are excited to meet you again bte and you will see my sisters(Lisa's) new boyfriend
16.03.24, 17:17 - Niki: They also ask how german is coming along and i said like my dutch so not that crazy good jet
16.03.24, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's nice! So we are celebrating Easter again this year then? <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
16.03.24, 17:18 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, I'm trying but it's hard 😅 I always get confused with Swedish or Norwegian when I try to construct a sentence 🥲
16.03.24, 17:19 - Niki: Yes on the Sunday after you got here
16.03.24, 17:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, nice that it isn't immediately after I arrive this time 😅
16.03.24, 17:19 - Niki: We will probably stay at my parents house for the day you get here
16.03.24, 17:19 - Niki: Yeah sorry
16.03.24, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't know what you're saying sorry about
16.03.24, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not like you organised everything
16.03.24, 17:20 - Niki: Would sound really funny probably
16.03.24, 17:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Laughing at me again I see
16.03.24, 17:20 - Niki: But i said yes without asking you first you know
16.03.24, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not like you could have easily said no though
16.03.24, 17:21 - Niki: Yeah 😅
16.03.24, 17:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, should I bring a present for your family then? I still don't know what the deal with Easter is 😅
16.03.24, 17:23 - Niki: You could if you wanna too my mom ask me what you want so you will probably get something. I will definitely get something to my neffew but not my parents probably but i dont know
16.03.24, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Let me put this more clearly
16.03.24, 17:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What should I get them and who should I get things for if I get something for them?
16.03.24, 17:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And what is normal to do in your family?
16.03.24, 17:25 - Niki: Let me think about for a day or too what to get them but probably my parents and my grandparents. Also let me chip in
16.03.24, 17:25 - Niki: Nothing over 20 euro or so
16.03.24, 17:25 - Niki: Chocolate and other sweets and some things to consume mostly
16.03.24, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, why do you need to chip in though? (I'm just curious. I don't know, we don't do presents 😭)
16.03.24, 17:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That I can do
16.03.24, 17:28 - Niki: Well i wanna be part of the present for my parents you knoe couple stuff 😘
16.03.24, 17:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, Okay 😅 cutie ❤️
16.03.24, 17:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I feel stupid for not thinking of that explanation 😅
16.03.24, 17:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, about datenight this weekend, when works best for you? (If it works out)

17.03.24, 10:11 - Niki: Shitty but i dont know why? Just one of those days
17.03.24, 10:11 - Niki: How was your night?
17.03.24, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, yeah, can happen, still sucks though
17.03.24, 10:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was okay, forgot to take my pill yesterday though 😅
17.03.24, 10:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's the placebo so it's not that important
17.03.24, 10:12 - Niki: Oh yeah true how is your period going down or less?
17.03.24, 10:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, it's the last day so barely feeling anything anymore which is always nice
17.03.24, 10:20 - Niki: Btw Any plans for today? Except date night?
17.03.24, 10:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, some school stuff and going to celebrate Lennie's birthday (and a little bit my grandma's too)
17.03.24, 10:22 - Niki: Oh nice how old did both of them get?
Enjoy the party
17.03.24, 10:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Uhhh... Good question, my grandma is turning 71 tomorrow but I kinda don't know about Lennie whoops 😬
17.03.24, 10:38 - Niki: Well happens i dont know how old my uncle is so yeah cant really say stuff to that😅
17.03.24, 10:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeahhh, fair
17.03.24, 10:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also I'm gonna need a refresher on your family's names because I forgot 🥲 I'm sorry

17.03.24, 11:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck with that, hope it goes smoothly
17.03.24, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Update, not going to the party, instead rethinking my decisions in the last year or so :)) (and trying to work for school)
17.03.24, 14:28 - Niki: Okay you wanna talk about it or just thinking for yourself at first
17.03.24, 14:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: We can talk about it tonight, it's maybe not that big of a deal but still, want your opinion on it too because it changes some things. Also need to talk to my parents about it if I decide on anything, but yeah, thinking first
17.03.24, 14:29 - Niki: Okay hon ❤️
17.03.24, 18:32 - Niki: Calling around 20?
17.03.24, 19:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: 20:30 also good?
17.03.24, 19:43 - Niki: Yeah sure no worries
17.03.24, 19:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I need to finish something first sorry
17.03.24, 19:44 - Niki: NO WORRIES
17.03.24, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Bit later 😅 I need to eat food
17.03.24, 20:25 - Niki: Okay
17.03.24, 20:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm ready, sorry for the delay 😅
17.03.24, 20:36 - Niki: No worries
17.03.24, 20:36 - Niki: null
17.03.24, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://flscompany.com/en/flugel/
18.03.24, 08:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning my love 😘
18.03.24, 08:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good luck at school 🍀
18.03.24, 08:12 - Niki: Good morning sunshine 💛
18.03.24, 08:12 - Niki: Thanks you too 😘
18.03.24, 12:04 - Niki: How is your day going so far hon?
18.03.24, 12:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Alright, procrastinating a bit too much but I'll manage
18.03.24, 12:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going so far love?
18.03.24, 12:14 - Niki: In class right now but its programming so a bit boring
18.03.24, 12:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You already know everything?
18.03.24, 12:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or just because it's an introduction class?
18.03.24, 12:15 - Niki: Mostly yeah
18.03.24, 12:15 - Niki: Introduced mostly
18.03.24, 12:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, fair
18.03.24, 12:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I also saw you have maths this semester?
18.03.24, 12:18 - Niki: Yes but i think i can take it over or so i hope
18.03.24, 12:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah right, you never know before the semester... Still so weird
18.03.24, 12:20 - Niki: Well i need to write them a mail to check
18.03.24, 12:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, I know that but here you get to know what courses you can skip for the whole program before you start the first year 😅
18.03.24, 12:48 - Niki: Oh yeah in that way yeah
18.03.24, 12:48 - Niki: Well live laugh life
18.03.24, 12:48 - Niki: Your on you way to class?
18.03.24, 12:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope, gonna follow class online and work on a group project at the same time 😅
18.03.24, 12:56 - Niki: Any ideas what i can make for dinner?
18.03.24, 13:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: https://www.tamingtwins.com/creamy-courgette-pasta/#wprm-recipe-container-20983
18.03.24, 13:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This maybe?
18.03.24, 13:04 - Niki: Not that big off a Courgette fan
18.03.24, 13:04 - Niki: Any other ideas?
18.03.24, 13:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: _writing that down_
18.03.24, 13:05 - Niki: Like i eat it no worries bit would make it my self
18.03.24, 13:05 - Niki: Love you hon 🧡
18.03.24, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still, I would rather make you things you actually like
18.03.24, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you too ❤️
18.03.24, 13:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I'm looking through my books for other ideas 😅
18.03.24, 13:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Potatoes with egg and paprika?
18.03.24, 13:09 - Niki: Yeah sure
18.03.24, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You basically roast the potatoes and paprika in the oven and bake an egg with it
18.03.24, 13:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also can add an onion if you want to spice it up
18.03.24, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and some cherry tomatoes! They also go in the oven but a bit later
18.03.24, 13:10 - Niki: The egg goes in the oven?
18.03.24, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You can roast the potatoes and paprika for 25 minutes at 190°c and add the tomatoes in 10 minutes before the end
18.03.24, 13:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, you just bake that one in a pan
18.03.24, 13:11 - Niki: Okay 👍🏻
18.03.24, 13:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, yelling "cool bike" at a motorcyclist is really fun 😁 did it last week and the guy revved his bike 😁😎
18.03.24, 13:54 - Niki: Yeah can image that i mean "random" nice thinks are allways great. Probably made his day
18.03.24, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, that's true, giving random compliments always feels nice too, people are always so pleasantly surprised
18.03.24, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also random update on something else, but Laeticia is probably breaking up with her boyfriend
18.03.24, 13:56 - Niki: Oh okay how is that coming?
His family was to big of a dick?
18.03.24, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, he is actually
18.03.24, 13:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it's a complicated situation
18.03.24, 13:57 - Niki: Should i cook the potatoes befor putting it in the oven?
18.03.24, 13:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He has autism and ADHD
18.03.24, 13:57 - Niki: Ah okay well mabye we can talk about it at somepoint if we feel like it
18.03.24, 13:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If you cut them small enough you can just put them in the oven, but don't forget to add some olive oil or something alike when you do, and you can add salt and pepper before too
18.03.24, 13:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah sure
18.03.24, 13:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just comes down on everytime something doesn't go the way he wants, he shuts her out, blames it on someone else and uses his diagnoses as excuses. She can't handle it anymore, especially after she was being hit on continuously by a guy, called him about it and he told her that she chose to go there so she can deal with it herself
18.03.24, 14:12 - Niki: Damm thats a "nice" guy great company
18.03.24, 14:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp, never met the guy but he sounds terrible
18.03.24, 14:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He also got mad at her because her mom had to at surgery last week and she was taking care of her. For that reason she couldn't go over on Thursday and bring food with her, so he got mad saying things like "what am I going to eat then? I don't have money to buy food" because he spent it on one of his hobbies... Like Jesus Christ he's a child
18.03.24, 14:17 - Niki: Good thing for her to break it off
18.03.24, 14:19 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup
18.03.24, 14:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Still sucks though, they were practically living together and it was her first ever relationship
18.03.24, 14:20 - Niki: Yeah
18.03.24, 14:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And she still loves him, but realises that it's just not good for her to stay
18.03.24, 14:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That has got to hurt
18.03.24, 14:24 - Niki: Yeah no doubt but still the right thing to do
18.03.24, 14:25 - Niki: By the way didn't have a onion but added garlic
18.03.24, 14:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's good too! It's just for flavour anyway, as long as you like it that's all that matters 😘
18.03.24, 14:27 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True
18.03.24, 14:56 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
18.03.24, 14:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Looks good, I hope it tastes good too 😋😘
18.03.24, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am crying over a fucking series
18.03.24, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That has not happened before
18.03.24, 19:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think
18.03.24, 19:16 - Niki: Really that good / interesting.
18.03.24, 19:22 - Niki: ?
18.03.24, 19:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Last episode of young royals
18.03.24, 19:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Very well written jesus
18.03.24, 19:27 - Niki: Nice mabye we will see
18.03.24, 19:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Business intelligence is confusing as fuck
18.03.24, 19:38 - Niki: yes
18.03.24, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
18.03.24, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: PLease
18.03.24, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: WHat the FUCK does that mean
18.03.24, 20:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have 84GB left this is bullshit
18.03.24, 20:21 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I may or may not be very frustrated with this project
18.03.24, 20:21 - Niki: No not in that sense its about the head of your data set and the lenght of it
18.03.24, 20:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I have no clue how to change that though
18.03.24, 20:22 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Lovely
18.03.24, 20:22 - Niki: Restart can help ?
18.03.24, 20:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The program has restarted itself 5 times and I still get this
18.03.24, 20:23 - Niki: or you look at the weka faq
18.03.24, 20:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Computer restart is possible if I have to I guess
18.03.24, 20:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah I'll take a look
18.03.24, 20:23 - Niki: yes thats what i meant but look at faq first
18.03.24, 20:25 - Niki: You need to change the Headsize of your data set if possible 
else you need to change the weka config or the settings of weka?
Faq should help
18.03.24, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You know what
18.03.24, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I am just stupid
18.03.24, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But also what the fuck is wrong with this program
18.03.24, 20:25 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But thank you hon, your support is keeping me sane 😘
18.03.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (It works now)
18.03.24, 20:26 - Niki: Nice restart helped?
18.03.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nope
18.03.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I chose the wrong class
18.03.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which shut down the whole program
18.03.24, 20:26 - Niki: okay
18.03.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which is stupid
18.03.24, 20:26 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it works so I will stop being annoyed about it now
18.03.24, 20:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Love you ❤
18.03.24, 20:30 - Niki: Love you too ❤️
18.03.24, 20:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: cutie 🥰

18.03.24, 22:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Wonderful way of looking at groupworks
18.03.24, 22:09 - Niki: Yeah or in general as long as  you dont need to do it its great
18.03.24, 22:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I hate it

19.03.24, 20:40 - Niki: Okay now i am confused too. Didn't you ask me what i was looking at?
19.03.24, 20:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yes but I meant on your laptop?
19.03.24, 20:42 - Niki: Oh my schedule and uni stuff
19.03.24, 20:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah
19.03.24, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What's up
19.03.24, 23:32 - Niki: Took a nap
19.03.24, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: This late?
19.03.24, 23:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Isn't that just pre-sleep?
19.03.24, 23:33 - Niki: Should do some uni stuff but will sleep probably instead
19.03.24, 23:33 - Niki: Yes
19.03.24, 23:33 - Niki: And
19.03.24, 23:33 - Niki: Yes
19.03.24, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's probably too late for that if you have class in the morning yeah
19.03.24, 23:33 - Niki: Yes i have
19.03.24, 23:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I know, I saw the schedule
19.03.24, 23:34 - Niki: Sleep is the only good choice i have
19.03.24, 23:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess
19.03.24, 23:34 - Niki: How was the talk with the others?
19.03.24, 23:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, not that interesting, didn't talk for long after you left anyway

19.03.24, 23:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Somehow it feels worse with texting 😅 maybe that's just because of the time though, idk

20.03.24, 10:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I did dream about you last night though, that was pretty nice
20.03.24, 10:23 - Niki: Nice what did you dream about?
20.03.24, 10:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't remember a lot of it, but I think you and your Alex came over to my parents' house on a trip or something. But you guys were only going to be here for a short time so we couldn't spend a lot of time together. In the morning (we didn't sleep together because Alex insisted you sleep with him) you guys got up and I thought you were going to leave already, but instead you were gonna go pick up my dad (from where???) but then we ended up at a shopping mall and I got lost. That's all I remember 😅
20.03.24, 10:50 - Niki: Yeah sleeping with my alex
20.03.24, 10:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I was not happy about that 🥺
20.03.24, 11:08 - Niki: I would never sleep rather with alex than you no worrys
20.03.24, 11:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good
20.03.24, 12:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, and about Aeneas dating, I don't know a lot, but Jingwen said he met her about 2 weeks ago during one of the French/English learning moments and she plays DnD. So he invited her to play it. Apparently she's an exchange student who wants to stay in Lille or something?
20.03.24, 12:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But that's all I know 😅
20.03.24, 12:04 - Niki: Oh damm nice really happy for him. Need to meet up with him again sometime
20.03.24, 12:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, true
20.03.24, 12:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But yeah, I don't know how the first date went/will go or when it is/was 😅
20.03.24, 12:05 - Niki: Yeah we will hear it at somepoint
20.03.24, 12:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hopefully
20.03.24, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going hon?
20.03.24, 16:28 - Niki: Great a bit stressful but else really nice. Going to dresden now. 
Also missing today is again a day where i miss you like crazy. Thinking about when you come over 😘
20.03.24, 16:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope things calm down a bit then. Drive safe and have fun in Dresden 😘
Miss you too, have been thinking about kissing you all day 😅💜
20.03.24, 18:43 - Niki: Really cute hon ❤️

21.03.24, 12:10 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
21.03.24, 12:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I just want to say that the goodnight messages are really important to me. I don't know how you feel about them honestly because you seem to forget them quite regularly, but when you go out and I don't hear from you, and I wake up in the middle of the night not seeing something I get worried about you
21.03.24, 12:34 - Niki: Yeah get that. I will try to send it more. But also my phone dying when i am out doesn't help.
21.03.24, 12:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's fair, I just want to know you're okay, that's all
21.03.24, 13:16 - Niki: Glad you told me

21.03.24, 13:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's nice to know, hope they can help you get through the courses easily then
21.03.24, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (you could do it yourself too btw, no doubt about that, but a bit of help is always nice to have)
21.03.24, 13:56 - Niki: Yeah knoe what you mean no worries
21.03.24, 16:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
21.03.24, 16:50 - Niki: Nice he is a real cutie ❤️
21.03.24, 16:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The way he literally guarding the door though... It's extra
21.03.24, 16:52 - Niki: He is only extra for you ❤️. Would do the same if you were around ngl
21.03.24, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Pffftt, as long as you don't try to sit on my lap that's okay I guess 😂
21.03.24, 16:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or drink the toilet water, like Moustache somehow seems interested in
21.03.24, 16:56 - Niki: no promises on that one
21.03.24, 17:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hmm
21.03.24, 17:04 - Niki: hehe 😘

21.03.24, 22:40 - Niki: Hon it hurts my heart to see you like that and i love you. I miss you too
21.03.24, 22:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're always tired of me 🥲 I just want to spend more time together 🥲 your sleep cycle is a bitch
21.03.24, 22:41 - Niki: Not tried of you 😡
21.03.24, 22:41 - Niki: Yes and i wanna spend more time with you too
21.03.24, 22:42 - Niki: Yes to the cycle
21.03.24, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Easy to say 🥲
21.03.24, 22:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was actually thinking I was wrong, you are your sleep cycle's bitch (no offence)
21.03.24, 22:42 - Niki: Makes me feel like shit
21.03.24, 22:43 - Niki: Sorry
21.03.24, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That also makes me feel like shit :/
21.03.24, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Cause I don't want you to feel like shit
21.03.24, 22:44 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But I said what I said

21.03.24, 22:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What do you mean?
21.03.24, 22:46 - Niki: This it hurts to hurt each other and it sucks
21.03.24, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It does
21.03.24, 22:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I never want to hurt you
21.03.24, 22:47 - Niki: Same why would we
21.03.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know why we would
21.03.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It makes no sense
21.03.24, 22:47 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But it still happens unfortunately
21.03.24, 22:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And sometimes we hurt each other because we're hurting ourselves too
21.03.24, 22:50 - Niki: I don't know what to say. Except i love you and i am sorry for hurting you today. Should i move Date night if i am feeling bot well? Or should i fall asleep with you?
21.03.24, 22:51 - Niki: *Unwell
21.03.24, 22:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Honey, you're tired, we shouldn't be talking about this now
21.03.24, 22:51 - Niki: You sure?
21.03.24, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I don't know, I feel bad talking to you about this when I know you're not fully conscious 😅
21.03.24, 22:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And I don't want you to go to sleep feeling bad too
21.03.24, 22:52 - Niki: Okay but then let's talk about it tomorrow please 🙏🏼

21.03.24, 23:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I never feel this way when we're actually together you know? That's the part that fucks me up the most

22.03.24, 12:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: He says it isn't 'unattainable'
22.03.24, 12:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going so far?
22.03.24, 13:01 - Niki: Abit weird to say it in that way. You can do it would also help
22.03.24, 13:03 - Niki: Feeling tried don't know why. Alex has too much energy for me but all good. Else doing so chores and sending out applications
22.03.24, 13:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'd rather have him be straightforward and tell me it's not gonna be easy, but fair point for motivational sake
22.03.24, 13:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Aw, damn, hope you get some extra energy then. Have you had lunch yet? Also hope they answer your applications soon
22.03.24, 13:05 - Niki: Nope i did not but also eat breakfast late so meh

22.03.24, 13:53 - Niki: Tonight mabye ?
22.03.24, 13:54 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, whenever you want hon 😘
22.03.24, 13:55 - Niki: Do we call or you wanna solve it over texting ?
22.03.24, 13:55 - Niki: You got time the whole day today?
22.03.24, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think call might be better to avoid miscommunication but I will go along with what you want
22.03.24, 13:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah
22.03.24, 16:07 - Niki: Wanna call around 17?
22.03.24, 16:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, sounds good
22.03.24, 16:09 - Niki: Still eating lunch right now how is your day going ? What are you up too?
22.03.24, 16:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: What are you having for lunch? My day is going alright, thinking about taking a nap though
22.03.24, 16:12 - Niki: Gnocchis with some mushrooms and onions
22.03.24, 16:12 - Niki: Take a nap we can also call when you wake up
22.03.24, 16:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds really good
22.03.24, 16:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, wouldn't take that long of a nap though so 17 is definitely good
22.03.24, 16:13 - Niki: Okay good nap hon ❤️
22.03.24, 16:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Thanks love, enjoy your lunch 😘
22.03.24, 16:39 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No sleep for me, Moustache keeps yelling for no reason :))
22.03.24, 16:40 - Niki: Ah bad cat. Hope he calms down atleast some point today?
22.03.24, 16:41 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope so, but probably only when he gets his food at some point
22.03.24, 16:42 - Niki: 😅 well yeah probably
22.03.24, 16:59 - Niki: Ready?
22.03.24, 17:00 - MF Rabbit 🐰: yeah
22.03.24, 17:00 - Niki: null
22.03.24, 17:14 - MF Rabbit 🐰: For the record, I want you to go to sleep after a long day when you are tired or when you feel unwell, I want you to feel good, but it happens so often it is quite frustrating. I don't know if it is because of the times we call or anything else, but I don't want you to be dead tired everytime we call. And it's not just yesterday. It's not just one occasion or two where this happens. It's pretty much every single time we call. When we first talked about this, you said that I always wanted to call so late or so long, and you weren't wrong about that, but now we rarely call for 3 hours. Outside of DnD we call maximum 5 hours a week. When you think about it, is 5 hours a week really that much to spend with your partner? I don't know how you feel about it but I personally don't think so? Yeah, okay, shit happens and we can't always do that I get that, but sometimes it would be nice. And I do realise we call while we sleep sometimes, and man I really love it when we do that, but while it is time we're calling, it's far from actually doing something together. But it does make me feel loved and wanted

Yeah, okay, you're tired, but so am I. But every time we call I try to be there as much as I can, because I know if I'm not there, nothing is going to happen anyway. I can't remember the last time we called and talked about something nice for a while in a conversation that didn't feel like we were both searching for something to say next. You say you're sorry but then nothing actually changes you know? And the worst part of all is that I know it's the distance that is making it so hard because I have never felt this way when we were together. Never. 

I would love to get my excited and happy and adoring boyfriend back because right now sometimes I feel like a chore instead of someone that should be a priority. 

I understand that the way I'm feeling right now is a build up of a lot of things and that I'm not right in accusing you of all these things when (though some I did tell you) I haven't expressed how I felt about all of this before. It may also have to do with how stressed I am or my anticonception pills finally working down my mood, but I won't use those for excuses. I'm sorry I'm dropping this on you right now. I thought I could work through how I was feeling without you because part of me also thinks I am a burden for feeling this way. What also does not help with that is that you never complain about anything. It makes me feel like either you don't really care or I just complain way too much and am being unreasonable. And I mean, I probably am exaggerating, because who else would stay up until 2am to see if their partner is fine and sends a goodnight message? Maybe I care too much, you tell me, but if that is the case I don't know how to care less. Because I love you so freaking much, it hurts to think you don't care the same amount.

23.03.24, 11:03 - Niki: How was your night my love 😘?
23.03.24, 11:05 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Was okay, how was yours?
23.03.24, 11:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also dreamt about kissing a girl, was interesting... Especially because in the dream you were okay with it?? Dreams are weird
23.03.24, 11:07 - Niki: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.03.24, 11:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
23.03.24, 11:46 - MF Rabbit 🐰: (also I really love getting voice notes so thanks for that 😘)
23.03.24, 11:46 - Niki: Yeah would also think it would be a friend and not a random person
23.03.24, 11:49 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No matter, I would still consider it cheating for myself to kiss anyone other than you
23.03.24, 11:50 - Niki: Yeah same no thoughts about that. Would still ask in any way or except to be ask
23.03.24, 11:51 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Makes sense
23.03.24, 11:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also for the record, just because it happened in my dream does not mean I have any intention to do anything like it in real life btw. The only lips I want to kiss are yours
23.03.24, 12:00 - Niki: Yeah no worries hon
23.03.24, 12:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Have fun at the convention btw!!!!

23.03.24, 23:00 - Niki: Nice day what you think of Oppenheimer?
23.03.24, 23:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Already saw it in the cinema before but I still think it's a good movie
23.03.24, 23:02 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Mostly because I love the cinematography, it's really well done how they play with sound and colours and camera angles
23.03.24, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah, and Lars also sent me a message today
23.03.24, 23:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Because he talked to Jinte yesterday and the topic happened to involve me
23.03.24, 23:04 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And Laeticia actually broke up with her bf yesterday. He's an ass and I despise him
23.03.24, 23:10 - Niki: Oh what was it about?
23.03.24, 23:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably about the fact that I was very annoyed and slightly mad at him for never bothering to send me any message after the last time we met up when he apparently has no such issues with Jinte
23.03.24, 23:12 - Niki: Ah okay so the straight topic i thought it was a other topic and he just texted you again 😅
23.03.24, 23:12 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I mean, I've known the guy since I was 3, and he doesn't send me anything after he doesn't read my messages and gets mad at me for not communicating with him? Not my fault, still slightly annoyed because he still didn't apologise but he texted me saying we should meet up
23.03.24, 23:15 - Niki: Mabye he wants to do it in person?
But overall you are right to be mad and should be ngl. He doesn't put any effort in to the friendship
23.03.24, 23:16 - Niki: Going to sleep now probably we can talk/text tomorrow about it more
23.03.24, 23:16 - Niki: Goodnight rabbit 😘🐇
Love you 🧡
23.03.24, 23:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, we'll see I guess
23.03.24, 23:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay
23.03.24, 23:16 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Goodnight my silly lovely goose 💜 Love and miss you loads 😘
23.03.24, 23:17 - Niki: Miss you too and have a surprise for you 😘

23.03.24, 23:17 - Niki: Please do some how

23.03.24, 23:20 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Btw, the German word for clumsy being "tollpatschig" sounds like a punishment for anyone having to explain they're simply clumsy
24.03.24, 07:26 - Niki: Well yeah but for Germans its not that hard or complicated word its like a everyday word
24.03.24, 07:26 - Niki: Good morning my love 😘
24.03.24, 08:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon ☀️

24.03.24, 09:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Enjoy the walk 😘
24.03.24, 10:14 - Niki: Went Alone
24.03.24, 10:15 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Hope it was a peaceful walk
24.03.24, 10:16 - Niki: Yeah was nice bit cold though

24.03.24, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: That's very fair
24.03.24, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I watched a documentary about a man who travelled for  years with my mom the other day, also really interesting
24.03.24, 12:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I think his name is Hans Stücke? I'm not sure but he was German

24.03.24, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Casper, part of his lines were actually things he wrote and told at his grandma's funeral so it's a pretty emotional play
24.03.24, 20:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk if you want to move Datenight to another day or just wait until Saturday?
24.03.24, 20:59 - Niki: Damm 😳. Sounds like a really important show for hope everything works and it will be great

25.03.24, 13:28 - Niki: How is you day going hon?
25.03.24, 13:28 - Niki: Kimich was the hot red thing right?
25.03.24, 14:08 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Okay, math kinda sucks but will live. How's your day hon? Got any answers from professors yet?
25.03.24, 14:09 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's more... Sour than spicy? It's fermented cabbage and it's a bit spicy but it tastes really good
25.03.24, 14:30 - Niki: Okay yeah think i know what you mean its really nice
25.03.24, 14:31 - Niki: Yeah could take over 2/3 courses from before
25.03.24, 14:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Which courses can you take over?
25.03.24, 14:40 - Niki: Math and "groundworks of programming structures"
25.03.24, 14:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh, that's nice, you gonna take up some extra courses or just leave it like this then?
25.03.24, 14:44 - Niki: Taking up extra already
25.03.24, 14:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Ah, I didn't realise 😅
25.03.24, 16:06 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also wearing a skirt shorter than my yellow rain jacket is weird
25.03.24, 16:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: How's your day going though? You didn't answer earlier 😅
25.03.24, 16:08 - Niki: Yeah would think so. Is it like wearing only a long shirt and nothing below that?
25.03.24, 16:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Probably looks like it
25.03.24, 16:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Doesn't feel like it though, because it's a tight skirt
25.03.24, 16:11 - MF Rabbit 🐰: ?

You?
25.03.24, 16:23 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Sounds productive for sure, hope class goes well. Math was meh, as always, and also went for much longer than he's allowed to. Now in Human Resources and I'm starting to doubt continuing to study 🙄
25.03.24, 16:25 - Niki: Yeah thats a really long day ngl. You get through it hon 😘
25.03.24, 16:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: No, seriously I might consider to keep the courses I'm interested in and just go to work, might be better idk
25.03.24, 16:30 - Niki: Well yeah you could but would think about it abit more and if you decide to look for a nice workplaces
25.03.24, 16:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Not gonna just decide on it now but the idea is growing on me to just work until September

29.03.24, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She was talking about how great of a dad he would be this morning, it shocked all of us
29.03.24, 17:53 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It's really weird to see people break up like this
29.03.24, 17:54 - Niki: Yeah and still be in same groups
29.03.24, 17:54 - Niki: Also weird topic of how great of a dad he would be
29.03.24, 17:55 - Niki: But yeah some people break up like that you never know if your not in there shoes
29.03.24, 17:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yeah, they said they will stay friends but I'm not sure how that will turn out
29.03.24, 17:57 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It made sense, we were talking about kids in the future and some of us saying we didn't feel the need for them but would do it for our partner, she said that both of them would like kids and that he'd be a good dad
29.03.24, 17:57 - Niki: yeah especially over the distance
29.03.24, 17:58 - MF Rabbit 🐰: True, but I just really feel for his gf because she was totally blindsided by his decision
29.03.24, 17:58 - Niki: Well yeah context then it makes sense
29.03.24, 17:59 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yup, that, but also because they both still love each other, that can make things very hard. How do you transition from a romantic relationship to a friendly one when you still love each other? I can't imagine it
29.03.24, 18:00 - Niki: Yeah well cant really either but it could be a on off think until the move together mabye ?
29.03.24, 18:00 - Niki: or a shitty romance movie from the 2000ths
29.03.24, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Idk, maybe that's just a me thing but I could not handle an on and off relationship, it would hurt too much trying to pretend everything is fine
29.03.24, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: And from what I know about them, moving together isn't happening anytime soon
29.03.24, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then again they have also never met irl
29.03.24, 18:01 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Oh yeah for sure
29.03.24, 18:02 - Niki: Okay yeah makes it way harder and unlikly in my opinion
29.03.24, 18:03 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I guess, idk, it's just a shitty situation
29.03.24, 18:04 - Niki: Yeah think so too. <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>
29.03.24, 18:05 - Niki: On my way to eat dinner with my dads side 🥲. Nah just kidding will be nice

29.03.24, 21:17 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I'm just doing the last bits to leave tomorrow and then working a bit on the school project
29.03.24, 21:48 - Niki: Nice cant wait
29.03.24, 22:13 - MF Rabbit 🐰: My wifi is literally too shit to work on the assignment... fml
29.03.24, 22:43 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I give up, been trying to do the fucking assignment for hours but the website keeps dropping so yeah... I will have to do it practically all when I'm with you 😭
29.03.24, 22:44 - Niki: Okay will get that

30.03.24, 04:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Good morning hon ❤️
30.03.24, 05:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On the first train
30.03.24, 05:42 - MF Rabbit 🐰: <Medien ausgeschlossen>
30.03.24, 06:24 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On the train to Köln
30.03.24, 06:40 - Niki: Good morning sunshine 💛
30.03.24, 06:45 - MF Rabbit 🐰: You're up way too early again? 😘
30.03.24, 08:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Holy shit I am lucky
30.03.24, 08:27 - Niki: ? What you mean
30.03.24, 08:28 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The connection I am taking goes from Köln to Hannover
30.03.24, 08:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: The train I was on to Köln only goes until Köln because of a technical error
30.03.24, 08:29 - MF Rabbit 🐰: If I were to take the direct connection I would be fucked
30.03.24, 08:29 - Niki: Thank God it works
30.03.24, 08:30 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yupppp, now to hope that my train to Hannover won't be late
30.03.24, 08:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Some people are such fucking weirdoes
30.03.24, 08:33 - Niki: Huh?
30.03.24, 08:33 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Or well, I'm pretty sure that guy was an alcoholic, he smelt like beer from 2 meters away
30.03.24, 08:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Then spit in his hands, put his spit in his hair, then started drumming on a garbage can
30.03.24, 08:34 - Niki: Well yeah probably then
30.03.24, 08:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Yuppp
30.03.24, 08:34 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I walked away
30.03.24, 08:36 - MF Rabbit 🐰: It really does pay off knowing more German to understand the fucking station announcements
30.03.24, 08:37 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Just being able to understand all the languages they speak on the train is great, I can hear everything 4 times and still doubt if I heard it right 😅
30.03.24, 08:38 - Niki: That's skill 😅. But nice to hear you understand more and more
30.03.24, 08:38 - MF Rabbit 🐰: I do practice every day you know? I would be absolutely bummed out if I didn't improve at all
30.03.24, 08:48 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Also the Komfort Check-In is fucking amazing
30.03.24, 08:50 - Niki: Personally dont use it that often ngl but yeah
30.03.24, 08:52 - MF Rabbit 🐰: First time I can actually use it, normally there's some technical issues
30.03.24, 08:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On the train to Hannover
30.03.24, 08:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: A lady is plotting to get me kicked off the train I think
30.03.24, 08:55 - MF Rabbit 🐰: But oh well
30.03.24, 08:56 - MF Rabbit 🐰: She said she reserved the seat I'm in but I triple checked it so yeah
30.03.24, 09:07 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Nevermind, I think she misread her own ticket, she's pretty blind
30.03.24, 09:08 - Niki: Yeah happens but sounds interesting
30.03.24, 11:31 - MF Rabbit 🐰: On the train to Leipzig now
30.03.24, 11:32 - Niki: Nice last train you nearly got it
30.03.24, 11:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Made a friend on the last train because of the lady that was trying to kick me off the train
30.03.24, 11:32 - MF Rabbit 🐰: Don't jinx it
