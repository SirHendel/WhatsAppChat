//int.bahn.de/en/buchung/start?vbid=70324fd8-aa8a-4b36-b65e-e0eb23f45806: 1

 But I want you to be part of every second of my life 🥺😅. Yeah I get it no worries 😘: 1
 Still have to do your own presentation?: 1
 True, however my dad doesn't dance and our boxes are gone downstairs so I doubt anyone will dance in there soon 😅: 1
 You read me too well too: 1
 Goodnight my silly goose ❤️: 1
 Bulletpoints because I don't want to write it all out: 1
 Damm its a dance floor now: 1
 I have to give you more credit for taking off my bra: 1
 Anytime 😊: 1
 😅 Well she can practice: 1
 I was gonna stay awake until you get home, but I'm afraid I will fall asleep before then even if I want to stay awake.: 1
 I will just never go to her house again: 1
 Honey rice Waffel: 1
 Made biscuits for almost 5 minutes: 1
 Still need to train more so you need to help me 😏😘: 1
 No really still trying around: 1
 Goodnight muffin 😘❤️: 1
 I am not at all tired right now: 1
 I missed my texts too, but mainly because I missed your replies 😅: 1
 No worries hon, I will keep that streak if it kills me: 1
 Alex said you're welcome 😂: 1
 I could listen to some music for that but I don't really want to sleep yet: 1
 Text you later: 1
 Welp better keep your streak: 1
 But what are you doing now?: 1
 I also definitely did not almost tear down a shelf by trying to kill a mosquito 😅😅😅: 1
 Well drink some hot milk and take a hot shower: 1
 Mabye he was swapped?: 1
 We could also go to the southern part of Belgium though, there's more nature there if you'd prefer that: 1
 Yeah also went shopping with Alex for groceries: 1
 The bed is so cold and empty it feels wrong: 1
 Goodnight then i geuss honey: 1
 Not gonna watch 2 weeks straight: 1
 🫣🫣🫣: 1
 I love you too rabbit 🐇❤️: 1
 I love you my silly goose ❤️: 1
 I will work until 12 I think now 😅 or if I'm lucky another half hour: 1
 It's okay if you don't know you know? I love getting messages from you but I also understand that we'll both be incredibly busy from next week on (well, maybe you won't but idk) so it's not that easy. I just don't want to lose you through us both being so busy during school: 1
 I would tell you if i feel forced to do anything no worries hon and i get what you mean. But i still wanna evolve/better myself: 1
 Happens : 1
 I mean... I'd fucking hope so ^^' Really wanna try to make them myself some day: 1
 Okido, because I am having SO much fun causing chaos with Drahomyr 😂😁: 1
 Going to play magic now: 1
 Happy birthday my lovely rabbit and most beautiful person in the world. Wish i could hug you and adore the whole day: 1
 I would call, but I think you should eat: 1
 Did I say something wrong?: 1
 You're still at your parents' place? How's your afternoon been?: 1
 Okay, good luck then 🍀: 1
 Sounds like a great idea 😊: 1
 Will try to think about it a bit more during the day: 1
 You wanna call i am ready anytime 😳: 1
 Don't worry too much about it, my sleep schedule is just fucked after the Gentse Feesten 😅: 1
 46.... Damm: 1
 Sometimes I just feel like sharing a random thing of my day or I just wonder how yours is. It's easy for me but I get that that might not be the case for you: 1
 Idk either honestly, it's just something I grew into 😅: 1
 My day is going alright: 1
 Back at home now: 1
 Probably gonna do 8: 1
 When do you eat dinner?: 1
 Not really, but then again, 1 of the interviews was cut short because they had to go to the store, I'm sending the questions over and I'm also going to ask if they know anyone else that would be up for an interview.: 1
 So I really need it 🥲: 1
 Yeah our tire popped: 1
 Yeah no, it's apparently caused by her experience with red flags: 1
 I would be there every day: 1
 Imagine if it was only a 30 minute drive or something... sounds like heaven: 1
 I fucking wish: 1
 You wanna call after dinner then?: 1
 Shouldn't be much traffic so I guess: 1
 Nope nothing planned so far: 1
 Don't really have a choice but yeah, will try to: 1
 Mabye some group work stuff: 1
 Yes 😘: 1
 I am back at home: 1
 Nothing much laying in bed and parked my moms car to the other side: 1
 Do you perhaps have a little bit of time to call me at some point?: 1
 Probably won't be done until 10-11: 1
 I think so but i told him that i would need to talk to you about it: 1
 It was potatoes with vegetables and vegetarian meat stuff: 1
 Yeah no i better get it now. They know more think about the stuff that i would need to know or figure out. Thanks hon for explaining it 🥰: 1
 Uh... okay, an example I've seen before is for example jewellery, let's say you're thinking of buying a necklace or bracelet or whatever the fuck for me but you ask them for help. A question they could ask is if I wear silver or gold. It's a stupid example, I just can't think of anything else right now.: 1
 Yuppp, and not only with guys 😂: 1
 I will try not sure what you mean though: 1
 You're biting my nipples: 1
 no, please let's take a break together, that's why I'm taking one now 😘: 1
 No worrys hon ❤️ you cant over share with me: 1
 I just know I will hate this semester already: 1
 I think part of this is also just that I don't like saying goodbye to you in any case, nevermind when I'm not entirely sure when we will call next and for the last time of today or something.: 1
 Told you i will tell you: 1
 Yeah same i have the same thing no worries: 1
 Also you know what, you're actually right, female friends sometimes do work that way, but to be able to get use of them when you're asking questions for presents... you have to pay attention to make sure they're not disappointed either when they ask you questions to figure out how to help you. No clue if that makes sense but it does 😅: 1
 Focus: 1
 I kinda do miss calling you at night until we both have to go to sleep. I know you didn't really like that too much though, but just the thought of falling asleep together is nice, even if over the phone. Idk if that makes sense or not.: 1
 I would ve ready: 1
 Never doubted that ❤: 1
 *Finland: 1
 Yeah well you look nothing like him to be honest: 1
 yeah for sure <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Also the discord group is helping with that or the contraire. For me it doesnt tbh: 1

 Thanks rabbit ❤️: 1

 I mean... Quite honestly I think there are few nationalities he'd have reacted better to than German... Although this also means that I will have to suffer to my whole family's relentless German jokes for the rest of the week. It was foolish of me to hope that telling just my parents wouldn't mean my whole family finding out by the morning of course... 😅: 1
 *we just play the thinks that come to your mind: 1

 Sucks but he didn't realize the size difference. Hope you find a alternative 🙏🏼: 1
 Ah okay well yeah makes sense: 1
 2) that "I hate you all" comment was on the amount of sleep you'd get tonight because Jinte also has a thing with just sleeping a bunch one night and then just not sleeping more than an hour for a few nights and thinking that makes up for it: 1

 How am I going to survive a lifetime of you making my heart skip a beat when you say things like that?: 1
 It's kind of a weird thing that is technically not legal, but not illegal either: 1
 Just better: 1
 by the way somebody tryed to to hook you up with there sons tonight ? 🤭: 1
 I'm going to the funeral on Saturday. This whole thing is kind of weird, I met her only a bunch of times and I barely remember anything about her honestly. But now she's gone she really made me realise that there are some people that I wouldn't know what to do without and well... Most of them have been around for a really long time. Or at least 5 years or something. And then I think about you and my heart just fucking breaks trying to think about it. Crazy how in less than a year someone can mean so much that the thought of no longer having them would make your life seem just... Bad.: 1
 I think he's saying it to comfort me: 1
 Nice but its kinda sad that some of them are fake and just for fame  there: 1
 Well mabye you can figure it out over time: 1
 Well just so you know i am frustrated now to so we can be frustrated togehter ❤️: 1

 In what way? Because you're not attracted to Jinte or what? 😂: 1
 I want to be part of anything you do even if we live right now 700 km away: 1
 Like the whole think is so shitty: 1
 Will try my best next time: 1
 You're trying to have a nice time with your friends and I think I kind of ruined that 😅: 1

 Hmm, drinking yes, going out meh: 1
 Yeah no we can also drive home.: 1
 When is class supposed to start?: 1
 Yup but we will see: 1
 That's pretty shitty: 1
 And the colour coordination is crazy: 1
 I forgot that these particular family members are also clients of my parents... It's all about accounting: 1
 Damn, okay then: 1
 Goodluck with overlooking the class, maybe take a nap if you're too tired?: 1
 And no email about anything: 1
 Would rather be with you: 1
 Boy... You better eat something good then, at least tell me you had a good breakfast: 1
 We are 🥰: 1
 Drink lots and mabye take a walk in the evening: 1
 Plans sound good up for everything as long as it is with you 😘: 1
 She is gone put alot of work in to it?: 1
 Someone who doesn't work well with a calendar?: 1
 Yeah fucks up alot sometimes: 1
 She made her own horns and everything: 1
 Oh yeah, they also took us to the store to buy decorative rocks?? Random as fuck: 1
 Okay thanks for the ideas: 1
 And then said they should leave: 1
 It was quite alright, what is on your planning for today?: 1
 I was joking about getting her to join: 1
 Jinte has joined the communists: 1
 This is a mess to solve some other time 😅 I think I can kind of figure out the old and the new classes though: 1
 Always worrying for you 😘: 1
 He didn't take it well 😅: 1
 Honey, anytime to tell me other than Thursday is a good time. Yeah, we can move it no problem. Just can't do Friday: 1
 I also would let it go if I thought it would be something important but this was such a stupid secret to keep I felt like I was justified being annoying about it 😂: 1
 Oh, meeting up again? That's cool: 1
 Well its sucks: 1
 Oh man, gotta love that 😂: 1
 Hope soo too ❤️: 1
 Wow, your schedule must have changed a lot since it was put in the calendar then, crazy: 1
 Children: 1
 I would actually say that went pretty well: 1
 Now: 1
 Wanna hug you badly: 1
 Kinda mad that you stay awake until 3 but also really cute of you 😘: 1
 Generic: 1
 Same, what she has planned looks really cool too!: 1
 Good luck renovating the room!: 1
 What am I supposed to say? I just really fucking miss you: 1
 I just figured out there's something we're missing in our relationship: 1
 I just said that if I stayed this bored I'd go out for walk, no clue what you got from that 😅: 1
 Basically I had to do a bunch of research on tabasco during my internship so I know way too much about their history and regional products. Now Cato has to do an assignment on the USP of tabasco so here I am giving them basically all the info they need 😅: 1
 Love you too?: 1
 I mean that text: 1
 Get that, it feels the same for me 🥲❤️: 1
 You're ridiculous: 1

 The ability to teleport: 1
 I would burn a candle for your success but I am at work now, will burn one if I get home and you're still working on it!: 1
 The grandparents are running through the house😅. And we are not the cleanest people 🥲: 1
 Yeah got that will do: 1
 I melting right now: 1
 Please send me a picture: 1
 I'm gonna say something that might not make any sense whatsoever, or maybe it makes a lot of sense, but telling you about the disconnect I feel has made me feel a lot more connected already? It's weird but it definitely feels like a relief even though I was definitely crying while we were texting about it earlier today. I don't like talking about this kind of stuff when you're out doing things with your friends and yet it always seems to be in those moments when I feel the worst, that timing is a working point of mine, but being able to talk to you when I need to is something I really really appreciate and love about you. Only one of many things of course 😘: 1
 I am so damn wet right now: 1
 Yeah i also dont know how long they stay: 1
 Please, I would beg you if there was any way for you to get here: 1
 Watching my comfort show, should also hang up my laundry: 1

 Well idk, I thought maybe you were asking about Jingwen's plans for the weekend or something: 1
 Did you talk with your mom since then: 1
 Okay man she is living in a show its crazy: 1
 Why do I always have competition in this relationship?? My relations with other people would be so much easier 😂: 1
 Also i definitely want some pictures of you: 1
 I get that it's been a long day: 1
 Good morning Hon 🥰: 1
 I'm really curious to see everything and meet everyone : 1
 The others?: 1
 Oh yeah that could be a problem: 1
 Just the outfits for Saturday but nothing else really: 1
 Okay, still wish I could hug you and/or just talk to you right now about this though, I know it would be a relief for both of us: 1
 You could tell me about the stupidest thing from your classes that I don't have the faintest clue of what it is and I'd still love to talk to you about it, or listen/read what you have to say about it: 1
 Good morning hon, it hasn't happened yet, hopefully it will at some point 😅 I hope your night was a lot better 😘: 1

 Yeah I know, definitely always automate it, just gotta find a way how to. Which is a funny assignment when you think about it, more than half the company exists out of people that program all day... What do you mean I have to find a way to automate it? Then again, it's a learning opportunity for me too, I'm not complaining: 1
 Miss you too and love you: 1
 Naughty boy: 1

 I would fucking love to kiss you right now: 1
 When I say I want something like this, I don't mean for me, I mean for both of us: 1

 But normal i would eat at the cafeteria in our university: 1
 You will never believe this: 1
 Quite alright I think, it's somehow easier to understand the more difficult stuff 😅: 1
 Pretty sure it was 2 months but yeah, definitely too long: 1
 There are more issues than I expected... 2 more minutes 🥲: 1

 Nice how is your feeling over all right now?: 1
 Okay so Instagram told me that it wasn't Alex's hotel that was on fire, but the building next to it... But they still had to leave the hotel for other reasons at 5am 😭 what the fuck even happened: 1
 It's not complicated in its essence, so the exercise classes are the thing I should focus on more in this topic: 1
 Well my day is pretty good too but it's all really relaxed 🤭. Hope it's not too busy and if it is atleast you can be hypt for ESC and dnd tonight: 1

 Ahh... I get it, I have to show my grandparents how to do so many things on their computer too 😅: 1
 He also had a pretty good idea though. I talked to him about us wanting some private time and he said that because both of us need to work in the week anyway, he could stay a few days like Sunday, Monday Tuesday and then maybe come back in the weekend after that? That way we have some time to ourselves and he isn't bored all day doing nothing: 1
 It's boring: 1

You just spooned me more and more. At some point you started taking of you pants and i started to fucked you from behind slowly and we turned up the tv so nobody would hear us until we heard my parents coming up the stars and i pulled out as fast as i could. Then i woke up 🥲 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1

 Rubber = gummi: 1
 I know: 1
 It's alright productive, nothing too much: 1
 Alright, math was a bit more complicated today but with the right effort I should be able to keep on track: 1
 But I would suggest using a wet towel to take the hair off instead of the piece of plastic they give you with it, it's much easier: 1
 I already almost pushed too far: 1
 Alex had a small car crash: 1
 You got this rabbit do your best 😘❤️: 1

 No clue: 1

 Oh damm he is on the level of thinking: 1
 It does but it was kinda funny: 1
 Well then you need to tell him that too and mabye shedule another dax or tell Anthony / Jingwen: 1
 I am practically getting an anxiety/panic attack just talking to him over the phone: 1

 Karl-Heinz Tuschel – Die Insel der Roboter: 1

 Would rather make you stupid. If you know what i mean 😘: 1
 Well sounds okay: 1
 What happened happened: 1
 Ah, okay 👍: 1
 Yuppp... What we think too, but she doesn't see it I guess: 1
 This part: 1
 I don't think so but I got some motivation out of this text so yeah 😘: 1
 Sincerely, I don't completely agree on that from a personal perspective because often when I sleep over things I start to think that what I thought before shouldn't be reacted to at all, when in reality it still annoys me but I start overthinking what other people would do in the situation.: 1
 calling him right now: 1
 Gonna stand at the door for 10 minutes now so I'm the first one out: 1
 Yours as job experience but some are more training like if there only for a few weeks: 1
 He was yelling until he found me (after 3 minutes of yelling back and forth): 1
 Nah its fine still waiting for them to come back to be honest: 1
 Sorry, I'm encroaching on the time you want to spend with fabian and Alex, please don't bother with me, spend time with them 😘: 1
 But everything is fine. Just spent 2 hours with him wating and doing the stuff you need to do after wards: 1

 You are so damn cute 🥺: 1
 I 100% do not believe that will ever happen: 1
 Yes we can also call now if you have time?: 1
 Yeah dont know really but we also dont know what the problem is: 1
 Yeah but being annoyed at somerhing and texting about wouldn't help that much. A conversation would be way better or sleeping over it could also help: 1
 I wish i could be there so much right now i would glady help you with all your "problems": 1
 Aw, sorry hon, you should have just told me that, I would have gotten into bed a while ago: 1
 What are you looking at handsome?: 1
 Please fuck me master: 1
 bitch: 1
 Was supposed to see my cousin today, but in the end her mom just came to pick up some books for her instead, did a few things to prepare for school and then I was suddenly invited to go to the movies with Jinte & co. Went there and now I'm back home. That was the best part of my day, other than that it's been a bit shit honestly 😅: 1
 Thank you 🥰: 1
 Thanks hon, but I'll probably be studying most of the time 😅: 1
 Damn, I also woke up at 5... Hope you didn't wake up for the same reason though, sounds like an animal was trying to dig a hole to my room from the neighbours house: 1
 His hair look good? Chat to him, I can wait : 1
 What are you and your fiancée cooking?: 1
 Okay then relax some and rest so the cold goes away fast: 1
 Good morning rabbit 🐇❤️. Hope you have a great time at the first aid course or did you felt like shit and didn't go?: 1
 Nah, just grabbing ice cream probably: 1

 Again, I have nothing in common with them: 1
 Yeah, I'm not texting because I don't want to see it go unread or unanswered for hours on end idk if that makes sense: 1
 I just want to get you something you'll like, not just because it came from me but because of the thing itself as well: 1
 I love it 😻: 1
 You only got them now??: 1
 You there's something called weed lube??: 1
 Yeah, explains why I only just woke up again 🥲: 1
 Nah, should be fineeee: 1
 Then spit in his hands, put his spit in his hair, then started drumming on a garbage can: 1
 Hmm, I'm sure I'll hear about it so I'll let you know what happens 😅: 1
 Her mom however is not gonna be happy if she finds out (which I really hope she doesn't): 1
 Beauville, basically a small festival for rich people in Alex's neighbourhood: 1
 Nah, apparently she feels fine so far: 1
 Well she is gone hate today's morning but else she will get back up 😅: 1
 Man i dont get half the jokes its crazy i think i need to recalibrate for real this time: 1
 Good morning my love❤️: 1
 Yeah think so too: 1
 Yeah should stick to one drink the howl evening: 1
 Don't know if you have time, but how's your day/the party going?: 1
 This mainly because her previous record of drinking was 3 pints and now she had multiple cocktails with vodka and rum... and probably beer before that... 😅: 1
 Really cute game is also going in that direction can tell you more tonight: 1
 Yeah i can imagine that: 1
 And didn't sleep whatsoever: 1
 Apparently jinte got fucked up drunk last night: 1
 Also only in Swedish, which is ridiculous 😂: 1
 I know how difficult it is: 1
 And considering the amount of alcohol and the lack of sleep all of them have, I think there's a 70% chance they make out after all: 1
 Goodnight my favourite silly goose ❤️: 1
 So Alex wants to have a treesome. Sounds kinda weird over all: 1
 I was wrong, my exam is on Friday apparently...: 1
 The other 2 apparently ran naked through a corn field this morning at 5am: 1
 I will try to focus on it: 1
 And Alex doesn't know yet, still has to decide: 1
 I  ready: 1
 However it gets better: 1
 You gone do them in the park. What's your opinion?: 1
 Sucks hope db isn't that shit: 1
 Man her life is like a fucking romance movie. Where the perfect just doesn't show up: 1
 Done with the work. Driving back from my aunts house: 1
 I fucking can do this thing on my own in less time than we're doing it in group: 1
 Alex and jinte: 1
 Okay Thanks hon ❤️ love how thoughtful you are: 1
 So apparently they're hanging out with the 3 of them a lot (the fwb's): 1
 Tell hon i am always open for gossip especially if its about jinte: 1
 Probably just relaxing and going on a walk with him and my mom: 1
 You're my best everything: 1
 You can read me pretty well 🥲😅: 1
 I know exactly what I want, but unfortunately it's 733km and 30 days away: 1
 By the way date night any idea how we're going to do that tonight? Or you still wanna decide later: 1
 Now I can wait an hour in Welkenraedt : 1
 Yeah probably everybody thinks a bit different 😅: 1
 I do keep forgetting that has a second meaning 😂: 1
 Yeah, I asked Aeneas if he was okay because he was so quiet, he said he was fine. I didn't mind not talking too much today, was nice to listen, I feel like I talk too much on other sessions anyway, was a nice change: 1
 Okay sounds like a plan. Just saying anything you will get me i will like because its from you.: 1
 It's a good group for the project?: 1
 We can also call if you have the time and we can talk about it: 1
 Hmm, the making out yes, she would do that: 1
 Ah okay well then i think she wouldn't be influenced enough to start anything to be honest.: 1
 People invent the craziest shit: 1
 3) she hasn't even had sex with Alex yet so that would be a massive leap in actions: 1
 *Wants: 1
 Goodnight fox girl sweet dreams😘🦊 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 The shorty comment made me think of it suddenly: 1
 Well, yeah, he does 😂: 1
 Yeah get that but its fine i stress myself mostly: 1
 Well if you wanna touch yourself i will give you my okay 😘: 1
 I fucked up: 1
 Would love to give you wanna: 1
 Already there 🥲: 1
 Nope, but Alex does. It is in the auditorium I'm most often in though, so that's pretty funny. : 1
 I think imma go to sleep soon: 1
 Ah nice do you have the prof in any courses ? Yeah well beginning of November the kitchen should come right ?: 1
 Perfect for a food conference no?: 1
 Going to sleep already?: 1
 Alex said yes: 1
 Gonna go to a political debate with Alex tonight, other than that nothing planned. I'm home now to eat lunch: 1
 Yeah fair: 1
 Waking up eating breakfast and stuff like that: 1
 Here it's 1cm right now and it's probably leaving soon 🥲: 1
 Well hope everything goes well with the kitchen then: 1
 You don't know what I would give to be able to turn around and cuddle up to you when I can't sleep: 1
 It looks great 😍. You look beautiful and love your "smile" is brilliant.: 1
 Goodnight my love, love you too ❤️😘: 1
 Goodnight rabbit love you ❤️🐇: 1
 Ups 😅 well its easier to count down: 1
 Good morning my love hope you have a great day 😘: 1
 Already at home, just have to make food: 1
 Too look around with my mom and her friends: 1
 Yeah nothing planed: 1
 I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse about it honestly: 1
 Gone take a shower now and the some food: 1
 Makes my heart melted but same i totally get it at the same time and feel so too❤️🥺: 1
 Going back now or party?: 1
 Enjoy the shower (without me): 1
 It was i dont i am kinda through with my mind today 😅: 1
 I read Leipzig before you edited it 😅: 1
 Yeah was really nice to talk with my friends again ☺️: 1
 Okay, yeah Chemnitz makes more sense: 1
 Nope, don't know enough about the world to make one: 1
 Sure hon, is in 15 mins okay? Eating dinner now: 1
 Yeah, that's fair. Did they give a reasonable explanation for why they didn't show up? Because that's kinda shitty honestly xx: 1
 "Only" 21 days: 1
 I know ❤️: 1
 Only just woke up, whoops 😅: 1
 6 hours of mathematics and then 3 hours of human resource management: 1
 What are you up to perhaps if you don't mind me asking?: 1
 That goes 2 ways though: 1
 Thanks hon i am now in Chemnitz <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 ??? It's a tv? Not rocket science?: 1
 Drive safe (whenever you go back to Chemnitz) 😘: 1
 Or well, I'm pretty sure that guy was an alcoholic, he smelt like beer from 2 meters away: 1
 Eh, we'll see, if it goes right I'll be with you when the kitchen is placed so I won't be around the mess then: 1
 Man I keep seeing videos of Bergen and I want to go back so badly 🥲 I miss it way too much: 1
 That is absolutely adorable: 1
 Alright, trying to distract Alex from her pain. Also finished the first certification project and started the second part of the course : 1
 Yes and watching the dnd movie: 1
 Just found out there's a 5 year age gap and Yuna (the gf) is 15... I can't: 1
 Yeah sounds like a good plan: 1
 I mean, DB, what did you expect?: 1
 What are you up to except being in a hiking mood?: 1
 Yeah i wish we could go hiking like so hard right now. Would hike all the way with you 😘.: 1
 I would take such a good hike right now. I have wayyy too much energy I can't do anything with, wish we could go on a hike together 😘: 1
 Are the French taco's any good?: 1
 Hahah, yeah true, will let you know if I hate it: 1
 Financial markets and products: 1
 Yeah the pimp look is completed 😅. But looks nice hon 🥰: 1
 What are your doing tonight?: 1
 Or both 😅: 1
 Oh Nice then i can see it more times and in person 🥰: 1
 If you don't want to you don't have to 😅: 1
 Okay i am excited to see. I Feel like a child waiting for Christmas ❤️🥰: 1
 Yeah I do but still I don't know: 1
 I'll do so once I get home, we're gonna check out now 😘: 1
 What the fuck?: 1
 How is your day going hon. Still understood something in math class?: 1
 What are you up hon ❤️?: 1
 3 fucking weeks: 1
 Yeah i don't 😅. Today i was thinking about coming over on your birthday but then i remember the birthday party of my grampa. I was sad all over again 😅🥲: 1
 As if you need an invite for that 😘: 1
 There's a switch year first, mostly general courses so I can learn the 'academic way of doing things' and then the master itself is the basics of programming (I think mostly Python), databases and all that, as well as ICT management of projects, those kinds of things.: 1
 Is that a invite to come over?: 1
 Ah got them and if i ask nicely ?: 1
 Pretty good more about the exams and talk with my group: 1
 No motivation= no motivation, thanks for trying to push me hon 😘: 1
 Oh right! I do know that one! I watched it with my parents last year 😅: 1
 Oh btw, I forgot to tell you but remember when I said Alex met someone on Tinder? Apparently it's no longer going that well because Alex is getting bored with the other person 😅: 1
 But still how was your day hon?: 1
 Good morning hon, I hope the same for you 😘: 1
 What's it about? I don't think I know this one. : 1
 Would have thought so too, but going outside and moving made it worse: 1
 okay yeah its that this is more importen than gameing with them: 1
 Ooh, nice! It's a fun movie 😊: 1
 Oh cool, how was it?: 1
 thanks hon love that 🥰: 1
 Wish for you to be here too hon 🥰🥲: 1
 Yeahhh, according to Alex apparently the hair bleach could make it more difficult for the colour to stick: 1
 Okay 🙏🏼 hope it's okayish: 1
 I hope the class(es) you go to and the meeting go well today 😘: 1
 Also, if you need me, let me know, I will get on the first train I can find if you need me to: 1
 I don't know why sorry 😅🥰: 1
 Goodnight see you in my dreams ❤️: 1
 Love you too and can't wait to get on the train tomorrow ❤️. 2 times sleeping ❤️: 1
 Thanks hon, hope you relax a lot then 😘: 1
 The jinte i got to know is not the person I would expect to have a lot of love interest. Yeah could be. The writing on the letter mabye indicates who wrote it: 1
 Hmm, I'm gonna go upstairs but not gonna go to sleep yet I think, my parents are watching a dating show and I literally can't even look at it 😅: 1
 You done with work now?: 1
 yeah had dinner befor: 1
 You can only try right?: 1
 Finally got home ... My dad is very chatty with his friends: 1
 and how does it go ?: 1
 Nice, have fun! Going alright, gonna try limoncello for the first time now 😅: 1
 Sorry I totally get that. Will do 😘: 1
 Yeah even though I would have liked to go to Ikea 😅: 1
 Such a good student, I'm really impressed: 1
 My prof just struggled with a small calculation... How am I meant to understand his exams when he doesn't even know how to do basic math?: 1
 I had it happen that I was 1 of 2 people that showed up to a class way too often, it always sucks because the teacher is pissed off the whole time 😅: 1
 Shopping is shopping I guess? 😅: 1
 Any time you need me I'll be there: 1
 he's trying to convince me he'll be fine: 1
 I still need to do the some of the work but will do it later: 1
 And kind of makes me feel good about myself 😅: 1
 Your gone start sales today? Hope the bruises are not that painfully when you sit down. Any thing else planed today?: 1
 How's it going? You're with your parents now?: 1
 They're also shooting fireworks again in my neighbourhood... Until when???: 1
 Its kinda funny but no snow for you: 1
 I'll let you know tomorrow 😊: 1
 I hope this time plans do go through, unlike the ikea thing yesterday! Have fun! And good luck in your classes <3: 1
 Oh, and I also woke up to my legs full of bruises 😅 but it's not that bad: 1
 In that case goodnight hon ❤ sweet dreams 😘🌈: 1
 Nice i won't be though: 1
 I'm calling with Aeneas and Jingwen now: 1
 I'm probably just having withdrawal symptoms: 1
 Sounds like a good Christian couple: 1
 I... The fucking... I am so concerned right now: 1
 I tried, put my alarm at 6 but I woke up and put it on snooze until 7: 1
 Sorry I am confused: 1
 Idk, I read the manual last time in Germany when it broke, but it suddenly popped into my mind when I was trying to sleep last night: 1
 Your sister may be psychic or something idk 😂: 1
 True and we cant do that: 1
 For goos studying: 1
 yeah but its not for me: 1
 And he's good friends with my grandpa: 1
 Guess only time will tell!: 1
 What are you up too hon 🥰?: 1
 Fair, fair, never said I didn't like it though 😘: 1
 Nah mate... Can't fucking believe him 😂: 1
 Okay, ready when you are 😘: 1
 Let me know if you need some rest tonight okay? You're cute when you're sleepy, that's not the issue, but ya know, I'd rather you get some rest ❤️: 1
 I have a question, but I don't want you to think it means anything else than it just being a question, I'm genuinely just curious. I've noticed that you often say you're tired when you end a call, and that you're going to sleep then, but then an hour later you're still awake. You know you could just tell me you don't feel like talking anymore right? I won't take offence to it or anything: 1
 We can share moustache 😘: 1
 Yeahhh... I'll try to leave: 1
 It's an online escape room 😊: 1
 Yeah kinda but most of the profs don't have that so yeah only the students: 1
 Apparently so: 1
 I also got this sounds interesting what exactly is that though?: 1
 So I got a new assignment, but first I have the absolute pleasure of telling everyone the illegal shit we're doing : 1
 Pretty nice ate the marmalade one: 1
 Exactly... Same thing with online reviews... Some people really think it's okay to bully someone because they can't see their face: 1
 I forgot how much I actually like using public transport: 1
 It shouldn't: 1
 But perhaps: 1
 Yeah, but you're a vegetarian, you have a proper excuse: 1
 Good luck in class, learn a lot ;): 1
 That's so sweet, cool and much more. I can't image hear something like this from a friend. I think it's one of the highest compilmants some one can get 😳: 1
 Well we still have somethings to try out so yeah its gonna be nice 😘: 1
 What's on the island?: 1
 I mean if you're parent aren't home i will take care of you sick rabbit 😘🐇: 1
 Only if it's reasonable time and stress wise please: 1
 You're still hanging out at the tournament?: 1
 I was very much not prepared to see that picture 😂: 1
 Could be worse for sure, I just thought their kid was gonna be here too so we could play some games or something like that, now I'm just following along. I'll probably learn some things though so I shouldn't complain too much: 1
 I'll put it on the list: 1
 I'm not sure it does anything to that feeling honestly: 1
 weird how?: 1
 Ah okay mabye you can explain it to me more or tell me about it tomorrow during date night?: 1
 on the phone looks worst: 1
 I constantly slipped off the pole because my hands were too sweaty 😅: 1
 Good luck with class and studying then! Make sure you do something fun in the meantime too 😘: 1
 Hope the assignments go well hon ❤: 1
 Pretty nice just doing some university stuff. How is work what are you up too?: 1
 Hope you have fun on the pole dancing class 😊: 1
 Okay, that works, maybe buy something for you to eat with that then, I think we can eat fish sticks with that. Anthony doesn't like them either though (I think?), so something for him as well I guess: 1
 How come? Limit of time?: 1
 What are you up to now? Just going to bed?: 1
 Finally home 😅: 1
 People are boring: 1
 Well I don't want to not to anything with you if you hadn't noticed that yet: 1
 Yeah, was pretty productive, also turns out we're doing sales from now on. Goodbye marketing!: 1
 more then 10 years: 1
 Will probably still change a bunch of things but it's a start: 1
 Yeah did the same a few days back it's not completely done but I think it's okay: 1
 Yeah I don't know felt right to say sorry for that mess of a text 😅. What are you cooking today?: 1
 We talk about the component list for the prototype and we need to go to an event on the 30.11. Nothing much else. Your Neigbors are moving ?: 1
 Just working on BAP I think, not sure if I'll go to dancing tonight, someone is coming over so I guess I'll see what happens. I'm working from home for the rest of today though so that's nice! : 1
 I am also getting red right now: 1
 Oh and could i get a picture with your new hair later 🥰🙏🏼: 1
 Nice but i am really tired: 1
 Same hon ❤️ same: 1
 Nice hope the way to  Oslo goes by a bit faster with the Playlist ☺️: 1
 Going to the party now went to another meet up befor: 1
 How come today doesn't work for you?: 1
 No don't need to worry no gifts: 1
 Oh damn, outside? Sounds really nice!: 1
 Yeah but great thaz you do it: 1
 Thanks Hon and hope the work goes easy: 1
 Ohhhkay, thanks for letting me know 😊😅: 1
 Apparently the insurance covers everything (or well, it should but we'll see): 1
 I meant about our conversation from earlier tonight: 1
 Sounds good, alone or with someone else?: 1
 Was in the library for studying and now into the cafeteria for some food. The only interesting think is Elias wrote me about a girl and how he should approach her. He ask how I did it and what he could do. Gone talk with him about it tonight over discord. How is your day going so far?: 1
 It's nice, just chatting, kinda tired though, gotta cycle back home later. We're watching a championship that takes place in Belgium. The 2023 Belgian Darts Open in Wieze 😅: 1
 Yeah okay, but have I seen the dog in person? No. If I do I might change my mind 😊: 1
 He actually said he's gonna try and make a character this time sooo, I have high hopes: 1
 But I think we need two more: 1
 I was also asked for relationship advice because I'm "Belgian" and they don't understand Belgian guys 😂: 1
 Good luck hon 😘: 1
 Yes its great: 1
 We bought a "whiteboard" with chalk and bin for the bathroom: 1
 but not for long i really tired: 1
 It seems I was a bit too quick in celebrating almost being home: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you had/have a good night rest. I'm at school now, kind of a fancy place today 😊: 1
 Hey love, how's your day going?: 1
 I've heard of it as well, mostly to do with raves if I'm not mistaken? Or at least a music festival, I don't remember exactly: 1
 I feel like there should be a line before that but okay: 1
 I met the new intern and she's so nice 🥺: 1
 Nah, don't worry about it, if we were in the kitchen together I would still cut them because I hate them myself, wouldn't want to subject you to the horror 😘: 1
 Alex told me around 11 while we were at the party 😅: 1
 Yeah we don't have classes today or tomorrow. Only released it yesterday thought.: 1
 I didn't know I got together with a master thief: 1
 And the worst part?: 1
 Oh well, as long as you have fun: 1
 How is it going so far ?: 1
 Good morning 😘. Party was okay we were there until 2 and then home for 40min kinda sucked but it was okay.: 1
 Yup 😂: 1
 Hope you have fun at facts 🥰. Whats your plan for today? Like time wise: 1
 So what else are you doing?: 1
 Yeah dnd plannen and doing something with alex probably playing some games or going out will see: 1
 We're definitely gonna lose this one though 😅: 1
 Hon then now you get your ass up and do some school work 😘. : 1
 Yeah sure, I'll get home as soon as possible in that case ❤️: 1
 Any ideas what we can make for dinner: 1
 Sounds nice, just wondering, is this lunch, a snack or dinner? 5 is such a random time 😅: 1
 Can we use that?: 1
 If you're sure: 1
 Sounds pretty chill : 1
 Whats going on with you and your cousin? How is the show?: 1
 10 min later: 1
 xD well the world gone ende with out electricity: 1
 Yeah, it's not that important though so I'll be fine. How's your day going so far?: 1
 Someone is 22!!! Eureka!!: 1
 Okay talk to the prof about the exam and its pretty chill. He is a good person i would say: 1
 (it's too early to think of something like that sorry 😅): 1
 Goodnight baby 😘: 1
 So much to do?: 1
 (also skip the fact that I only saw him for a total of 4 hours and know practically nothing about him at all 👍): 1
 Just school work that I procrastinat on: 1
 I thought of a tattoo but yeah kid too: 1
 Nice, let me know when you have them 😘: 1
 Also (I know I don't have to say this but anyway) be safe ❤️: 1
 Yeah, true, but whenever I ask what you're playing with Alex, Overwatch seems to be the case 90% of the time, idk why: 1
 Except taking care of it? Studying 😅: 1
 I will secretly learn to ski by next year 😁: 1
 Yeah we decide on a first  semester party from another uni: 1
 Pretty nice. We are planning the night now because everybody got something they wanna do.: 1
 Yeah you got really good at understanding my bullshit that i say or feel. Its crazy normally only Alex or Marco and Ole. And they know me for years /some even for a decade: 1
 Sucks that the party was shit, but at least you still had a good time doing something else. : 1
 Or that you feel annoyed with me or this stupid thing: 1
 Let's put it a different way: 1
 Yeah same, we can still adapt it 😊: 1
 Cato is heating their pizza on the fire though, but I had to try a hot honey waffle: 1
 Train came early: 1
 Okay yeah I don't know if you care much if your parents find out. Exepte for the talk: 1
 I don't know what she's planning to do right now, I think she's probably gonna try to creep the shit out of him so he leaves her alone but maybe not... I'm not sure. Also don't really think confronting him is a great idea because he knows where she lives? Could retaliate easily: 1
 Playing games 😅: 1
 Yeah I am dead tired too 🥲.: 1
 Wait what do mean?: 1
 Translation is commercial trade/business administration, depends on who you ask: 1
 Okay get that. But she needs to confront him right? Should do it with somebody but still you need to talk to them?: 1
 Just straight up laying there giving zero fucks 😅: 1
 A+ stalker for sure: 1
 What up my love?: 1
 If I had any clothes that were big enough I'd offer you the same btw: 1
 Of course I sleep with her daughter?: 1
 Will do have a good night of sleep see you tomorrow at dnd 😘: 1
 What exactly do you have to do?: 1
 Ah... The good stuff... Procrastinating...: 1
 hun ?: 1
 Hope it's going well 😘: 1
 Quite frankly I was really excited about climbing the wall so yeah, would have done it for any good reason 😂: 1
 Yeah, but more than that it sounds like an actual Christmas song I hear every year... But I can't think of what it's called 🧐: 1
 I don't work that way: 1
 Idk, in Belgium you often don't really know your neighbours either, god knows I barely know their names 😅 it's not like we see each other more than just the occasional time where we coincidentally are outside our houses at the same time. : 1
 You're fucking cute, you know that? I love you: 1
 I think if you can out smart him he will accept it and give you the power of a God: 1
 Apparently my grandparents and aunt + Pieter are in Bergen now... I'm jealous: 1
 I wish. I've been reading that book I told you about and it's given me some rather unholy ideas. May or may not have gotten inspiration for future adventures: 1
 How the paper going though?: 1
 I also broke into my neighbours house today (with their consent): 1
 Have fun at the party! We're having a small get-together at my house with some family members, nothing too big, the question is whether or not we'll be home on time for the food 😅: 1
 Honestly not that much, just a reflection, introduction of the company, those kinds of things: 1
 Turns out Robin is much younger than all of thought 😅 apparently the guy is 26 or 27?? Now it makes sense how he gets along so well with the BAP group: 1
 Important for the brain.: 1
 Looks lovely: 1
 Ah nice tomorrow dnd as 4 wow. Your still gone play the character by the way. How is alex doing over all? If she gets together with her i will need to give them numbers or Alex's Alex will be a thing then 😅: 1
 Yeah, but if you want to do sports or anything like that I guess it is easier, but I don't really think I'll do it anyway: 1
 Well it was scheduled last week but he collects them in propably 2 weeks with a bunch of other stuff: 1
 (and CSS, but they never actually explained what the difference between the 2 is): 1
 They drilled one time with out sedatives and iit was hell would never do iit again: 1
 But good news! I'm seeing one of my friends in an hour!! 🥳: 1
 By the way maya and Fabian broke up.: 1
 Sorry hon 😅: 1
 Favourite thing you've read (book, newspaper article, anything)?: 1
 Except the part where it's apparently snowing now 😅: 1
 Have you started yet? And if so, how's it going?: 1
 Yeah, I'll live no worries: 1
 Yeah dont know the reason thought: 1
 It does kind of suit you to say it: 1
 Well I would like too be there too but oh well 700 km between us are ij the way: 1
 Talking about age gaps… man, people are... in interesting relationships: 1
 But he'll probably tell you all about it when you guys talk : 1
 Why is everyone younger than me 😭: 1
 Your bestie Alex?: 1
 I turned on the nightlight function and it was immediately a lot better... Thank you 😘❤️: 1
 I love how concentration she is 😅. Hope the shoot goes well 😘: 1
 Why not??: 1
 Yeah no worries. I am totally fine with it. Please tell your mom not to worry about it ☺️: 1
 What's it about? I'm just watching tv, kinda bored: 1
 Well yeah probably something like this. It's gone be interesting. Please tell me how it was and how they were?: 1
 I got into a fight with my mom: 1
 Glad you're keeping busy, hope you get the emails you want today 😘: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you had a good night 😘 good luck at the training session!: 1
 Good morning I slept good. How did you sleep and what are your plans for today?: 1
 Hope so too, he talked about next week which sounds good: 1
 True, and I don't feel like doing a lot of research to make sure it makes sense 😅: 1
 Good morning, how did you sleep? 😘: 1
 Yeah probably remind me just of you 🫣: 1
 Would you be more motivated to work if you were calling someone that was also working? Just out of curiosity: 1
 Then you're still assuming what I want, aren't you?: 1
 Okay, sounds good : 1
 I'm done with everything : 1
 Nice get some deserve rest hon 😘: 1
 I'm asking to know if I should wait with watching it until next week: 1
 You know, Alex sent me a reel on Instagram yesterday to ask about it, it was a techno club I think, and ever since I have only been getting ads on Instagram for clubs: 1
 Nah, we can call: 1
 I decided to take a train to the station before the one that was recommended to me, in hopes of getting before the masses, and I actually succeeded: 1
 Yeah, I'm still playing the character since that was something we worked out before we thought of Jinte joining and it kinda makes sense now within the campaign. Alex isn't doing great, but she'll get through it somehow I'm sure. Plus I'll try my best to help her out of course. : 1
 No problem, I'll figure something out, I'll get thinking 🤔: 1
 Ahhh 🥲 that sucks... Hope you can still enjoy it even with a burnt tongue 🥲: 1
 Yes, pretty much fully to the ceiling: 1
 If she was drunk, and even if she wasn't, I think the situation isn't that serious? They made out but I honestly doubt anything is going to come of this, other than maybe Killian getting his heart broken... It's hard to tell of course because I don't know either of them: 1
 When do you want to do date night?: 1
 Yeah I did turn the car around. I am home now it was not that bad driving at "rush hour": 1
 Thanks hon, hope so too 🙏: 1
 You can also always ask me anything, I promise I won't get annoyed or mad at anything you want to know ❤️: 1
 You don't have to be sorry about that, I was just wondering, I figured it might be something like you having a hard time to fall asleep, but I just thought I'd ask to be sure 😊: 1
 Pfftt, thanks for letting her know 😂: 1

 Nah, he doesn't have a doctorate, imagine that... he started working at my uni at 24 😅 yeah, turns out big time rush made a difference after all 😂: 1
 Your uni seems to change schedules so often? Why? Hope you get something useful done in the time you have now though.: 1
 I mean, I don't know how you guys are when you work together but I can imagine it's at least a little bit more entertaining than doing it solo: 1
 Man just love too see you undress: 1
 How much have you done on the cookie think? Hope she can help/ give you some useful advice. I am at university right now and working on some university stuff between my courses. They change the schedule so I have 4 hours between them 🥲: 1
 You're gonna have to make it up to me on the date part though 😊: 1
 Ok well you get people way better than I do and thanks for 'convince' him: 1
 How is your work day going? On what are you working right now?: 1

 Apparently it's mandatory for her school, but yeah, she's been travelling a LOT: 1
 Oh, there also is a photographer coming by work today to take photos of the new people... 😅: 1

 A little bit: 1
 I don't know why i just get tired. Not of you but with you if that makes sense?: 1

 Yeah okay, I believe you: 1
 Yeah kinda like the way they solve it. But also on some points it's useless well we shall see. You ate lunch already ?: 1
 Kinda makes sense, it learns from data input, but there's no real control as to what data is put in, especially the age concerns make a lot of sense too. Yeah, VPN solves all issues 😂: 1
 Poor jinte: 1
 Not gonna lie hon, that one sounds kinda weird: 1
 Making a portfolio sucks though, had to do it twice now and it is fucking hell, but yeah, probably should make one: 1

 Out with my family now shopping then lunch and preparing for the party tonight: 1
 Would you please for the love of god drive home safely before you answer me? But thanks, we can keep it that way then : 1

 You'll figure it out, I'm so sorry this happened: 1

 I'll find a way: 1
 i have no idea what is the error but good luck fixing it: 1
 I don't know exactly why. But i thinks because most people that I know are not so close with there neighbours. I mean I don't even know there names here and where my parents life it's the same (for me): 1
 But clubbing is allways nice bit dancing why not: 1
 Did not expect that but I'm glad you don't mind 😊: 1

 Slaap kindje slaap: 1
 It's not even my fault: 1
 I thought I figured it out... 😭: 1
 Okay yeah no we did talk also not for that long.: 1
 Because it was in the oven for 30 minutes already when the power went out and then we left it in for another 20 so it turns out it's quite okay: 1
 How was driving today and are you going to the  christmas tree burning?: 1
 If I accidentally learn how to do basic programming through this internship I will laugh my ass off: 1

 "Shit, Oh, I shouldn't curse. I would say it's not allowed by the church but I think I can't say that anymore either": 1
 10 or 9 I think: 1
 How's your evening been?: 1
 No appointment made yet: 1
 Doing great Fabian is now in a good mood but gets tired so probably one more game: 1
 Do you have anything planned tomorrow evening?: 1
 Sucks what your gonna read?: 1
 I love reading books with you 😘: 1
 That looks so cool??: 1
 Hope you can relax with the people that are coming over and you also have tomorrow for the BAP so I guess that works.: 1
 Don't push yourself if you're too busy, but maybe we could make it a study date in that case? No clue if that would be fun or not but we could try it out maybe: 1
 Why not? I once helped them fix their garage door, it's just being a nice neighbour? Idk, it just makes sense to me?: 1
 Nevermind, her mom fixed it for her 😊: 1
 Is there a maximum of years you can study one topic in Belgium?: 1
 Failing at my doulingo and looking at more coding stuff 😶: 1
 hypt for iit: 1
 She was, sadly passed away a couple of years ago but I really liked spending time with her 😊: 1
 Well nice for the BAP sucks that your group wasted a week because of her but nice in the end. I have no idea how Alex gone pass sif she is not going but well.: 1
 The BAP question... Basically she agreed on our plan last week but somehow didn't tell us about that, we had a whole meeting about it, I said some passive aggressive things (but in a polite way so she probably didn't notice) and in the end nothing really changed but dear lord, thank god we can finally start our actual research: 1
 You ever thought about nudes in our relationship by the way?: 1
 Good morning my love hope you sleep well and get your 8 hours of sleep 😘: 1
 Easy got her identity now haha easy money🤑: 1
 The BAP will get done, I'm sure of that. Deadline is Tuesday at 9am so we still have some time, which is making me procrastinate on a couple of things, but I'm getting shit done.: 1
 Also hoping for the day i dont need to say it anymore: 1
 Yeah I think so too.: 1
 Damm yeah she attracts weird people. Except you and mabye Lars: 1
 Your going to the BAP meeting now?: 1
 That's not too bad yeah. I'm not really doing anything right now. You?: 1
 Mabye some medicine this time 🙏🏼: 1
 Yeah Monday sucks this semester 🥲: 1

 You play tennis???: 1
 That's fair, same for us probably: 1
 Okay sounds interesting the only think I now about pole dancing is that it's really hard. Hope you have fun with Alex on that.: 1

 Sure Sounds nice: 1
 Alex made a sticker out of it.: 1
 Would love to take you in my arms and tell you: 1
 I am too. I will see what you think off my area and friends/family: 1
 Schatz?: 1
 Nah, gotta talk about my investments: 1
 You are a beautiful person character and looking wise i can only adore your clumsy self: 1
 Yeah.. well at least we managed to decide we're going to the DnD movie on Friday? And yeah, at least I got some part of it done: 1
 Kinda wondering what you mean by escalated but okay 😂: 1
 Hope you that feeling isnt the howl time or stays like that strong.: 1
 Did you hear about the fires in Portugal?: 1
 Yeah I see it everyday 🥰: 1
 Society: 1
 Morning love, my day is... Going? How's yours?: 1
 Okay will do that but just to be sure can you mabye remind me of it on the 12 🙏🏼😅: 1
 Is that a good or a bad thing? I'm confused 😅: 1
 Yeah, same, guess we'll see: 1
 Looks like a sports drink: 1
 Its getting fix I would say: 1
 We can also call later if you don't want to choose? Then you can hang out with her a bit longer and if you decide you would rather hang out with her for the rest of the night you just let me know? I totally understand you know 😘: 1
 Sorry but the text kinda help still heavy head though🥲: 1

 How is work going? Is somebody still there?: 1
 According to one of my friends it should: 1
 If that's what they're going for, they're doing a great job 😂: 1
 But you could put it like he could try to find more Erasmus communities, pretty sure there's some student clubs where he could talk to Norwegian Erasmus students? Idk?: 1
 And Alex is a bit of a pushover apologising to her, but I guess I get it, they've been friends since they were 3 I guess: 1
 damm okay good luck 🍀: 1
 Okay but please eat more than mais crackers 😘: 1
 Well they seemed not that reliable: 1
 Hahaha, oh no, that must have been a surprise 😂: 1
 Okay don't mind you nagging me to be honest: 1
 Just methodology of a research paper... Shit I've seen thousands of times by now, but yeah, can't do anything about it so... I'll suffer through it 😭: 1
 Didn't talk about, didn't want to stretch the presentation too long: 1
 The call with the tutor was awkward as hell 🥲: 1
 Yeah get that but just practice find some points too relie? on.: 1
 If I run into anything I really can't understand I'll definitely let you know, so far it's dumb things though, only 2 things on the list that made sense after I looked them up. Boolean values and rage clicks (should have known what the second was honestly): 1
 /is: 1
 Yeah, I can: 1
 Thank you 😊: 1
 You still with us?: 1
 I don't know if you can see my results: 1
 Same... I mean, I guess you get used to it but I'd hate to be hounded by fans anytime I'd go out, never mind when I'm on vacation in a different country: 1
 Lunch with my grandparents again. Then take the train to Leipzig and new years party with my friends. And you after the 8 hour drive?: 1
 If it was just flavour... I would just say to bring some spices with you, texture is a bitch to deal with and both... Well... Yeah... Nothing much to do about it I'm afraid: 1
 My hands are shaking: 1
 Sometimes on or the other and sometimes both: 1
 Nice in the air fryer?: 1
 I concurred a seating spot! Eureka!: 1
 Nice, hope it's delicious 😘: 1
 That must have been a very boring 5 hours, also so long???: 1
 Valid, and if it's only sometimes shitty, worth it: 1
 Going to bed now: 1
 Do you go home in between classes or what do you do?: 1
 Yeeey, something nice tonight after all 😁: 1

 Always before an exam 😅: 1
 Going shopping with Alex now for dinner tonight. My day is kinda packed😅: 1
 Oh, it's still the thing from yesterday or something else?: 1
 But it tastes amazing: 1
 Hahah, yeah no, I signed an NDA so I'm afraid that's not an option, thanks though! 😘: 1
 Hope you got home safely ❤️: 1
 Had a really hard time getting up this morning, also woke up around 6 for some reason, other than that slept well: 1
 Ahh okay sounds interesting.: 1
 The pacing is abit fuck but looks nice: 1
 I have to say, you have made me realise the stereotype of Germans always being early/on time are not true at all: 1
 I'm gonna do the same, I hope to meet you in dreamland 😘: 1
 Sweet dreams my ever so loving and dearest boyfriend whom I adore 😘: 1
 *3 years: 1
 ChatGPT might have given me the solution already: 1
 But in my defence that's hard to tell sometimes: 1
 I'll just hope to meet you in my dreams, that'd be a perfect night for me (at least when I can't have you in my arms) 😘: 1
 So we use this one?: 1
 Yup same: 1
 Just threw up 3 times: 1
 It's fine you will get a other day. What did you do wrong: 1
 *Again: 1
 How is your night going hon? 🥰: 1
 Just university i didn't do yesterday and probably a some lol game with Killian becaus they need a 5 persons for 5 vs 5 games: 1
 Sexual rapes? I think? Or sexual assaults?: 1
 i did do much but thanks and No worries i feel the same way most of the time i ready stuff like that too.: 1
 Hope you have a great time: 1
 Good morning my love. How did you sleep?: 1

 Nevermind, my day was ruined 😅: 1

 *Ges = games: 1
 Miss you lots right now 🥺❤️: 1
 Ich vermiss dich auch: 1

 Will do tomorrow 😘: 1
 But I get it if you don't think these kinds of jokes are funny: 1
 Well... Ikea is big enough to do both I guess? But they better get going quickly, doesn't that thing close at 8 or something?: 1
 Wtf okay its like 2 euros a beer but yeah: 1
 Same hon ❤️ was amazing and really fucking funny: 1
 Mabye i would have stop me or got me some luck: 1
 No clue, nothing planned. You?: 1
 Cutie both of you: 1
 Yeah, I usually use another one, wait, I have it here: 1
 Yeah okay, maybe I shouldn't hang out with Alex anymore... I just realised I basically psychoanalysed him and now I feel uncomfortable about that 😅: 1
 Yeahhh, we'll see: 1
 Yeah, I've been at that since 8 this morning 😅: 1
 Anthony is like his fucking laptop. You hit it too hard, it breaks, you don't hit it, nothing happens. It's a delicate balance in letting him know we haven't forgotten him and that we still want to interact with him, while also accepting that he's probably never going to take the first step in organising a get together, even when you know he wants to be at a get together. He just wants to feel wanted sometimes, hence why I need to 'convince' him, even when both of us already know he wants to be there: 1
 I love you too hon 😘. How is/was the night with Alex?: 1
 That's pretty nice. Sounds promising I don't know why he needs to be convinced but good job 😘: 1
 Well you should do it with everyone but for some people it helps you understand better. So I guess don't be sorry: 1
 We can call every day: 1
 Write me when your get home savely 😘: 1
 Get that and lovely that you think and feel that way but i am kinda sorry too 🥲: 1
 Thx will do. Love the weird dream 😅. Yeah right the brunch and then shopping with your aunt and mom. Have fun with your family: 1
 Drunk driving is a big danger: 1
 But still very sweet: 1
 Good morning hon, slept shitty again so I hope your night was a lot better 😘: 1
 Just found out ChatGPT is being blocked in Italy... And they're threatening to also block it in Germany: 1
 No more answer: 1
 Phone dead?: 1
 Dnd went pretty nice. We did a very short one shot so they can get a feeling for it and get to know the rules. At the Ende they killed each other 😅: 1
 What kinda of sick are you feeling or where are you feeling unwell: 1
 If he keeps up the good work, I'm sure it will go up at some point: 1
 He started streaming on Twitch? How's that going? Nice that he's passionate about it!: 1
 Now we're doing stupid things with fire: 1
 Well atleast you got them all now: 1
 Idk, haven't asked: 1
 4 days of not seeing your gorgeous face will hurt me : 1
 Both... 😂: 1
 Hope you had a good night. Sorry but I  fell asleep really fast. Sleept really nice though.: 1
 It's kinda difficult to explain in a text so that's gonna be a voice message, sorry: 1
 Dude is friends with everyone: 1
 Good morning 🥰: 1
 Well, at least you didn't wake up at 7? Didn't you have classes today though?: 1
 I think I slept... 16 hours since yesterday sooo... I honestly can't say anything 😂: 1
 xD but yeah google sucks: 1
 Ah yeah right today is Monday I am completely of with the day I don't know why 😅. Wait what happened I thought you were good in time. The other teams where way worse.: 1
 Nice that it is fun even though you shopping ☺️. I did some university stuff and played some games with Marco and Elias. Now making lunch and later play with ole around 3.: 1

 Nice he can se the construction side on the roof. What are you plans for the day by the way?: 1
 Nothing much just working on the website and relaxing abit.: 1
 Will do tomorrow: 1
 Good morning schatz hope you had a good night 🥰. Any plans for today?: 1
 Nice got the same feeling for. Your text: 1
 Oh nice how old did she get?: 1
 Yeah, that's definitely there too ❤️: 1
 Yeah I mean we can stil call but I am not sure how long we gone call then? Or we gone move it to Sunday Or Saturday? To be honest I got kinda tired though the call: 1
 Nice, looks good! 😊: 1
 The one on the ground 😭: 1
 Hope so too for you 🥰: 1
 Yeah stop a while ago. Gone to the supermarket with Alex and now home again: 1
 Could you do me a favour and fill in some bogus answers please? I'm trying to figure something out 😅: 1
 We change the cloth because of the weather it's kinda cole: 1
 Korea stuff: 1
 Yeah, I saw it, looks pretty funny: 1
 Only just started: 1
 Okay, sounds nice! You know where you're gonna go already or just the dates for now?: 1
 Just slightly, I wasn't too worried because he just really looked like he wanted to talk to someone. Apparently someone he knew just died and I think that's why he got so drunk and started 'spreading love' like he said in his own words: 1
 Excited for the birthday party? Anything else you're doing today?: 1
 Always coming with you 😘: 1
 My day has been okay so far, nothing special. How is yours?: 1
 I had to go immediately from lunch on the train and now I am regretting not taking my headphones with me 🥲: 1
 Yeah we just play some mortal combat and are getting ready to go now ☺️ have a nice rest from your 20km walk 🥰: 1
 *btw: 1
 We got to try all kinds of exotic fruits, was really nice 😊: 1
 Just for the record, you take the morning and I take the afternoon right?: 1
 I finally get food 🥳: 1
 Nice, drive safe 😘: 1
 I need to write a "lastenheft". It's like a Softwareprojekt blueprint but more professional: 1
 Good morning☀️: 1
 But when I look at the dc, I think maybe it's not so bad: 1
 How is the work going still boring?: 1
 No, that's tomorrow and Sunday: 1
 Nothing till now will probably wait until 15: 1
 I don't mean it in a bad way sorry: 1
 Which app do you use ? and No you didnt tell me: 1
 Getting out of bed sucks massively 🥲: 1
 Goodnight love, can't wait to see you tomorrow ❤️: 1
 Fml: 1
 Purple suit wasn't really in trend for women in that time I'm afraid <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Yeah the food wasn't that great but expensive so we only ate a few piece here and there. best think was some Indian bread but not Nane bread: 1
 Well i could lend some of the wearable thinks from my uncle and moms friends. But its probably still around there some where: 1
 I meant it in really just the most basic meaning of forgetting, letting go, not remembering, not looking back for me: 1
 Okay, just call me when you want, I have nothing planned: 1
 Yeah sorry was it confusing to see me react 3 times with other emojis: 1
 yeah kinda feels like it: 1
 How is work going? Which podcast are you listing too: 1
 I'm answering more questions for journalists, I'll also be taking over some tasks from Elisa so I know what I'm doing when she's gone. Do you still have class today?: 1
 Chill day until later?: 1
 Well that sucks any other plans now?: 1
 The second season is just really good 😁: 1
 Yeah I kinda feel bad about the beginning because I didn't pay much attention 😓: 1
 Just put my alarm: 1
 Sure for the police statement i do also do that: 1
 Good morning love, I hope you slept well 😘: 1
 Yeah I guess that's true: 1
 But that's not the point: 1
 Yeah, on the train now. Thankfully I have no neighbour now! : 1
 Making foos at somw point still need to write a email and nothing else: 1
 Which season are you on?: 1
 Yeahhhh, yeah: 1
 Did Aeneas send you any pictures?: 1
 Yeah, feel that, slowly killing me inside too 😅 but I like seeing a reminder of us more so yeah: 1
 Was nice, would do it again but maybe next time with Alex too because it kinda felt like 2 different friendgroups at times: 1
 Dead the green hair girl at the start and a live Loki: 1
 The others wanna go to Ikea and shopping but there is no real time schedule so I am relaxing and waiting for them 🥲: 1
 Anthony eats fish stick do we have enough? We meet them at Outland now and then we will go back to fantoft: 1
 Thanks you driving back now? Yeah now that you say it I can kinda remember ask Aeneas 😳: 1
 I'm just joking around no worries: 1
 I just love you soooo much that I wanna make sure you try your best. In every thing you do.: 1
 No Ikea we went shopping only for groceries: 1
 You enjoyed it?: 1
 Not that engaged in the group anymore?: 1
 yes because I have other shit on my to-do list as well D: 1
 Its awfull they just arrived and with Daniela so i am pretty sure they gonna stay until at least 20: 1
 Pretty sure I'm just being rejected by anything electronic now: 1
 I already miss the landscape of Norway 😢: 1
 Should watch a video recording of the class that was cancelled on Monday, but that's about it: 1
 That's pretty nice!: 1
 Aeneas also said it looks good on you: 1
 Thats a yes ❤️: 1
 Glad you at least had a nice time 😊: 1
 Pretty good. What are you up too and any plan for the plant: 1
 You're going to the food thing soon?: 1
 Nice, I hope you get a reply soon! What kind of ideas did the other teams have or you didn't talk about it?: 1
 Huh what you mean? In what way?: 1
 Ah, okay, predicting my overanalysing? 😘: 1
 But snow... 😄☃️: 1
 Hope. It stays that way: 1
 I wish I could be of any help to take some stuff of your list 🥲: 1
 I woke up and I was immediately worried about it 😅: 1
 Yeah i will try soo now 😅🥲: 1
 Good morning hon ☀️ I did sleep better last night 😊 hope you had a good night too 😘: 1
 Yupppp, now to hope that my train to Hannover won't be late: 1
 Just some fried snacks in the air fryer, don't have anything else at home: 1
 🫠🥰 You make my heart melt with message like this 😘: 1
 Damn, either you stayed awake super late or the hour change fixed your sleep schedule 😂: 1
 You'll get here too I guess: 1
 Yeah would be great bit the weather reports say no 🥲: 1
 The data science group is... Something else: 1
 Good morning slept good just woke up. How about you?: 1
 But i also wanna text you back 🥲: 1
 Nice proud of you 😘: 1
 Finally back home and watching dart now with my family 😅.: 1
 Good morning, how'd you sleep? ❤️: 1
 I hate Alex's parents...: 1
 Purely out of curiosity, why did you stop calling me Lämmchen? (Or however you write it): 1
 Yeah, but it's not just that, they have had a shit ton of chances and only scored 1 goal while the other team came over once and scored 😅: 1
 You just disappear when you think the topic is done and I still want to talk about other shit 🥲 (other topic) or just anything: 1
 Nice hope you grow against 🤭: 1
 How many packs do you have left?: 1
 Sorry for the Instagram call again was quit confused while I did it 😅. Why do they have a call function 🤔: 1
 Definitely worse than Frankfurt main: 1
 (I also absolutely suck at taking selfies): 1
 Okay hope you find the perfect spot. Just image interns running around placing plants and the step back to taking a look if it's fine 😅: 1
 Well i feel got damm hot for it but i also need to write so no touching myself 😅: 1
 Will do hon: 1
 Found what you (we) forgot this time: 1

 Yeah sounds like a good idea: 1
 Good morning baby 😘. Yeah okayish how was you night?: 1
 I'm gonna fucking kill someone: 1
 yeah also it was multiple: 1
 Huh how did that happen 😳: 1
 *Way: 1
 Okay well if it's family it's a different story. Then I would do it too. Kinda weird that they need to draw armpits but well who am I too understand the minds of artists 😅: 1
 2 vs 4?? It's still 1 vs 1 here 😭: 1
 And I'm sorry in advance for this: 1
 Looks pretty good: 1
 We got an introduction to some software they use and then were told to check it out, so that's what I'm doing now. So far so good?: 1
 Hahah, yeah nah, it's nothing professional, my cousin just has an art project that she needs people to be armpit models for, I have absolutely zero further information 😂: 1
 Have fun at the party ❤️: 1
 My mom bought a book on 'hygge' and for some reason that was in there: 1
 Okay thats kinda interesting. How did you get the opportunity? And what do you need to do to be a good armpit model? : 1
 Okay 🥰 Same, music does a LOT: 1
 Nah, don't have class this morning and only 3 hours this afternoon so today is pretty chill. I hope you have a wonderful day 😘: 1
 Yeah I woke up around 9 and made breakfast and went back to sleep until now 😄: 1
 I'm on the train to get there now and picked the worst fucking seat possible 😅... With an alcoholic 😅... He started talking to me about utopia 😅...: 1
 We almost were planning to go to the erotica convention... I swear to god this is the second time I had this conversation with someone. First time was with Alex I think...: 1
 Yeah I was a awake until 2 I don't know why to be honest 🙃. I have nothing much planned some learning but that's all. Hope you have a great time with aeneas in the cat Cafe 😘: 1
 I think that's when dnd starts love: 1

 Good morning rabbit ❤️: 1

 But seriously, I just sometimes do want you to send me a random message because quite frankly getting a message from you makes my day a lot better and I like seeing that you think of me if that makes sense: 1
 For the record, it's nothing necessary bad, it's just something I feel like we should talk about it: 1
 So your day is not going well. What happened / what shity task you need to work on now? I woke up at 7 to go to university at 8 and the lecture was canceled and I didn't see it 🥲. So I got some free time till 14 for my next lecture.: 1

 Yeah it's crazy and kinda scary how much they see from one visit to the website. But it's still interesting to see: 1
 Also Alex ask me why you had the emote behind your name 😅: 1
 Good morning honey 😘 How was your night?: 1
 The kid's idea: 1
 Before anything happens, so apparently a family member of mine died last night. I'll have to talk to my parents about the funeral which is probably going to be next week. My dad is probably not going to attend either, and they will also be leaving Belgium on Tuesday so it shouldn't matter too much, but I still wanted you to know in case. (For the record I was not close to her at all, which is why I'm so nonchalant about it): 1
 Crazy but really cool 😎: 1
 man I dont know we meet up like every 2 monnts: 1
 Yeah get that too. Its always shitty to say goodbye.: 1
 Thank you!! ❤️: 1
 How was drinking with your coworkers?: 1
 Yeah, makes sense... I'm just really not looking forward to this exam: 1
 I want to ask but I will wait until you get the okay to tell me from Alex: 1
 Awww but a kiss?: 1

 Parking was €15 😭: 1
 Noting much just relaxing and doing some chores for the apparment: 1
 Never done that before though so I will suck at it: 1

 I hope for your sake it's only an hour or so: 1

 Yeah... My dad takes his birthday very seriously: 1
 Watching everyone eat is pure torture: 1
 Idk, just feels like I haven't done anything until I got to class: 1
 I know, I saw it on your face 😁: 1
 Who is it ? Did they say/ write something ?: 1
 I'm gonna fucking destroy it: 1
 You see we're still in the call on discord maybe?: 1
 Everytime i think about i get happy too 🥰.: 1
 You're just laughing at me now: 1
 *1 are to much: 1
 Do you have time to call sometime today or tomorrow?: 1
 What are you and Alex are talking about?: 1
 Thanks that feels nice to hear 🥰: 1
 Yeah also a good idea but don't know how many drive to ghent: 1
 Hah🤭: 1
 Yeah, me too... I'm planning on staying up until 12 to send him a birthday message, even if he says he doesn't care about it, I think it's a good day to see who cares about you: 1
 That's fair, good luck working on the website then 😘: 1
 Cute, sexy and smart: 1
 We shall see I guess or not: 1
 ups sorry 😅: 1
 Ahh your so cute 🫠: 1
 Tell me more i am interested: 1
 Datenight might be a bit later Thursday, gotta go driving and bake pancakes first, but I'll try to be quick 😅: 1
 It's not that much honestly, just have to get rid of the remaining things in my room and then wash my walls: 1
 Nice how is the rest of your day going so far?: 1
 Yeah a lot of things are happening right now around you. Hope you can relax abit while your here. Will try my best do you can 🥰: 1
 Ahh, good, eat some lunch and take a nap. If you want to take a break or something this afternoon we can call if you want to? Idk if you'd feel up to that being so tired ❤️: 1
 Let's put it this way, that very fine line would very quickly be shredded to pieces and left far behind: 1
 Yeah, will see what happens, gonna probably look at the theory during law because it's supposed to be just a q&a: 1
 Okay sure: 1
 Okay, hit me with your best guesses then 😘: 1
 Pretty chill didnt do shit: 1
 Same as yesterday and dnd. You gonna help you parents now?: 1
 I can send it to you if you want but it's not at all interesting in my opinion, has a bunch of useless things on it too 😅: 1
 Presentation in 10 minutes... Gonna die 😊: 1
 We're nor: 1
 Apart from that though, I really still dislike texting with you hon 😭: 1
 We'll see I guess: 1
 Yeah, guess so 😘: 1
 Well done my love 😘🥳: 1
 Do you think an internship counts as training or as job experience?: 1
 It sure does: 1
 Fuck i am a idiot forgot the presentation. How did it go?: 1
 Poor Moustache 😅: 1
 I will try to do better tomorrow I swear: 1
 You know, it's a little bit pathetic how just reading and writing these texts my whole body is essentially shaking from arousal: 1
 Insurance issues, gotta love that: 1
 I'm afraid I'm gonna need more info to track the package down, either someone didn't think to inform us, stole it or it was delivered in the wrong place, but it's probably not in our street 😅: 1
 No no, not shrink, grow!: 1
 I... 😭 Boy: 1
 My mom's and dad's are really funny: 1
 Close but manageable? You're already on the next train then?: 1
 This child is trying to inflate my ego until it fucking floats to the moon or something idk, I can't handle it and I don't want it: 1
 Man sounds like a villain: 1
 Yeah but I also just read it with out thinking: 1
 Else I need to use a VPN for it or a proxy: 1
 In about half an hour I'm going for lunch with Cato, then to the Barbie movie and then watch a Livestream of probably the new young royals trailer, that's about all that's planned out for this afternoon. What about you, studying?: 1
 I am procrasting right now will get back too it: 1
 How our the guest?: 1
 Well... I'd let you 😘: 1
 Apparently my parents told him (the banker guy) about you and that we're going to Berlin and he apparently loves Berlin so now he's gonna send me a bunch of recommendations: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you had a lovely night 😘: 1
 Yeah, who knew glasses would do the trick? But yeah, it's great : 1
 You look really cute: 1
 Man sells Christmas trees, if anyone has enslaved elves it would be him: 1
 what time works best for you?: 1
 My grandma made filled zucchini with linguini: 1
 My grandparents are excited to meet you again bte and you will see my sisters(Lisa's) new boyfriend: 1
 And I can not be asocial because we were divided in small groups of 6: 1
 Yeah, we still have to do that though, that's for when we 'don't have any more work': 1
 Sounds like you had a good time, and third?? Congratulations! 🥳: 1
 Although I usually easily get bored watching movies though, but I guess that depends on the movie: 1
 Yeah well i geuss that goes both ways: 1
 I told Aeneas if he wants to do anything with you on Friday he has to talk to you, but I am kindly asking you to keep the evening free, we're going on a date: 1
 Nice, doing great hon ❤️: 1
 Found this out through a big time rush reference 😅😂: 1
 Nice What did they ask you? And now your heading back to work?: 1
 Just hope you have fun 😓😅😘: 1
 So I asked her about it: 1
 Basically I was meeting up with a friend (not anyone I actually know) and it was quite far, had to take a train, so I get there, we're hanging out and it's all fine but then at some point we're in his car and he just randomly starts jerking off. I'm completely shocked, obviously, and don't know what to do so at first I try to ignore it. But he's just... Going for it while I'm right next to him so I kinda make a noise to remind him of it. He... Uhm.. finishes and I'm just like... What the fuck dude I'm out of here I'm going home what the hell. So I get out of the car and he follows me "common give me a goodbye kiss" obviously I'm not going for that and I run away to the train station. Send you a message to ask if you can call but you say your grandma is in the hospital so it doesn't fit and then I think "well, I don't wanna bother him about this shit" and that's kinda where it ends. : 1
 Anything interesting happen today?: 1
 Goddamn, that's pretty fucking productive! Had a nightmare, so my night was kinda shit, but it's alright: 1
 Night was good woke up at 6 and been doing some work that I didn't finish yesterday. How was your night?: 1
 They really did make it more bearable, didn't have to go looking for food, was great 😊: 1
 My apologies: 1
 yeah i know: 1
 I'll add it to the list 😊: 1
 They don't make cars like they used to 😜: 1
 Yeah but I don't feel to bad about because now we can definitely call: 1
 Okay yeah I would think about it twice.: 1
 Finally back at the hotel now a shower and the sleep: 1
 Cato wants to take pictures in the park 😅: 1
 With the paint/drawing: 1
 Okay, good to know, thank you 😘: 1
 Well you managed to make me speechless... Congrats? I... Still don't know what to say? I'm not sure I would like that but it's really sweet so I appreciate it? Haaaaa idk, I'm flustered: 1
 Everyone is so fucking done with this project goddamn...: 1
 Yeah, guess so 😅: 1
 I'm not really a club person either though 😅 : 1
 By the way I am trying to be better at the calling you but i do really small steps 😅: 1
 Got a free bag chips 😁: 1
 You like fondue or raclette better?: 1
 Seeing your reactions to ESC is really cute 🥰: 1
 It's amazing how much different stuff they give you as an intern.: 1
 Taking a break now, hope you're having a great time 😊: 1
 But it's quite interesting, I just wished my Dutch writing skills weren't so rusty: 1
 But practically everything else is fine as long as it's not strawberry ice cream: 1
 Neither actually, a journalist, apparently I'm doing PR now as well: 1
 Good to know: 1
 Well your the little bitch i think i will need to endure it then 😘: 1
 Thanks Hon hope you have a great night too: 1
 ... you're insane but okay: 1
 Yeah got to my class and I slept okayish. How was your night?: 1
 Yup, that, but also because they both still love each other, that can make things very hard. How do you transition from a romantic relationship to a friendly one when you still love each other? I can't imagine it: 1
 Love you too and I hope I'll meet you in your dreams then 😘❤️: 1
 Well I haven't pet the dog yet so I mean, not yet fully worth it: 1
 Yeah nah, just booking in some documents, bit more boring: 1
 Good morning my love yeah my day is going okay so far having some stuff to do and waiting for mails and more 🥲. How is your day with your grandma going sofar? Do you have anything else planed for today?: 1
 And fuck this shit why am I so emotional lately, this is bullshit: 1
 Turns out I never needed it, the thing it's about hasn't been in use for 5 years 😅: 1
 Nice still all in Dutch?: 1
 Good morning my love 😘. I slept well how about you? Omw to university right now gone be late 😅.: 1
 Whats the secret: 1
 Mabye call the ADAC?: 1
 Good morning love, hope you had a great night 😘: 1
 Okay why?: 1
 Good morning, hope you had a good night sleep ❤: 1
 I usually overthink everything so I see the blessing in that one for sure 😂: 1
 If you wanna to?: 1
 Yeah your allways popular: 1
 I'll wait: 1
 Nothing much just looking for something to watch: 1
 I am really bad at social thinks: 1
 Man, it is 9 😭: 1
 What did you end up making?: 1
 Will be very interesting: 1
 That's a bit sad: 1
 Hard to say: 1
 Nice meeting up with your BAP group now?: 1
 Eat something good then 😘: 1
 I'm fucking something up for sure: 1
 I'm also kinda tired myself so this works out perfectly 😊: 1
 Did some work on the paper then I went out with my dad because he need my help with some measurements. Now it's back to the paper until my sister comes home. What are u plans for the rest of the day?: 1
 No but the other people where stupid not gonna lie: 1
 Good morning love, hope you slept well, what are you up to today? 😘: 1
 But the castle apparently fits 50 people or something, it's crazy: 1
 That's nice to know, hope they can help you get through the courses easily then: 1
 Nice, enjoy yourself 😊: 1
 Good morning my love😘. How is your day going so far?: 1
 Didnt start on that so far: 1
 FUCK: 1
 Have fun with the dog and good luck with the group project 😘: 1
 Else just some more learning and more stuff: 1
 Which happens often or not? Also hope they're not annoyed you're texting me the whole time then 😅: 1
 Kinda dead but still have a lot to do 🥲: 1
 Yeah you know the game?: 1
 yeah my day is going okayish. Nice hope you have a nice rest day hon 😘: 1
 You'll definitely get a picture at some point: 1
 Show me the feet (the shoes you got): 1
 I want to say something else but I'm gonna wait until we call because I don't want it to be misunderstood through text (mainly because I don't know how to properly explain it): 1
 What are you up too hon ?: 1
 Well, yeah, that can also happen 😂: 1
 The _vibe_ has changed: 1
 no not really to be honest: 1
 Maybe a little bit but then again I think we just communicate better when we're actually talking than when we're texting. Not gonna lie, our texting styles are kinda not really that compatible. It just makes it a little harder to understand: 1
 Hon i get the hate but sometimes you go to far to kill the mosquitoes: 1
 Still feeling "anti social": 1
 I take back what I said before, I am very much not a fan of muscles, they are gross. The soup is nice though: 1
 I don't want to go to sleep but I can't find another reason to text you without disturbing whatever you may or may not be doing: 1
 Turns out I am not done... Because it would mean another website to use, which is too much, so I have to look for a tool that works within either Google forms or sheets: 1
 Big pain this time ?: 1
 No worrys I wanna try it.: 1
 Yeah, if that's okay? But you don't have to reschedule something if you've already planned it 😅: 1
 Just hard to think when you turn me on like this 😘: 1
 How was the BAP Question by the way did she except you proposel now? Did you go with Alex to the law lecture? Sorry that I ask this only now today I was really busy 😓: 1
 Nope but that give me some peace of mind will see: 1
 Yeah send email mit way but no response yet will see. I am kinda fine with it because of the Disney land think but will see: 1
 Oh, okay, that's good!: 1
 Btw I save and cut out the text so I can send the your "cute text" because your so cute 🥰: 1
 He kinda does though: 1
 I feel like part of me isn't in the right place: 1
 I don't think you can do anything to be honest. It's just on me but I guess it just a feeling for me and no it's nothing you do. We can try to call more mabye it's just a think I will get over with more calls: 1
 Okay will try but i am pretty sure: 1
 My dad forgot my graduation thingy and was planning on running half a marathon 😂 (turns out he's incredibly lucky and he can do both): 1
 What are you up to? Playing games?: 1
 ... you bastard: 1
 Yeah no worrys please don't hold any conversation back if you want to talk about it: 1
 It a mix I like it because I can see and talk too you. But I also feel sad afterwards and I don't know what to do or to say I don't know. I want to call more but I feel weird while doing it.: 1
 Turns out the train doesn't ride to the right station... Fml already done with this shit 🥲: 1
 No can do, calling Aeneas at 9 apparently 😅: 1
 I also may have found a teacher for Ukrainian/Russian: 1
 I definitely don't blame you for having to do something or go somewhere, it makes total sense especially when it wasn't really scheduled or known beforehand that we'd call, it just feels shitty to say goodbye in every situation 😅: 1
 Damn, that's like half the temperature it is here... It's gonna be 24C° today ^^': 1
 yeah grocery list is a good idea thanks 😘: 1
 It was nice! A little bit boring, especially because it was only my cousin and I as the young ones. Everyone also left really early, but yeah, it was nice seeing some family again : 1
 Hope you have a great night with alex and her family: 1
 Study and making food soon: 1
 Call me when your ready: 1
 I'm gonna go Christmas gift shopping with my mom and aunt tomorrow: 1
 Hey you never know, Alex knows a world famous DJ: 1
 Mostly Rock and some punk Music. The food was shit just drank some beers with some friends there. How was your evening: 1
 Let me know when you leave? And I know you're not gonna listen to me but still, drive safe, take a couple of breaks (this is the part where I know you won't listen but it's fine, I accept your flaws): 1
 Whatcha gonna do for the rest of the evening?: 1
 I have absolutely no clue what that means, but I'm glad you like it : 1
 Totally gonna skip your message for a second sorry, I just got this notification and I don't like it, is this a sign?: 1
 Okayish just laying in bed now: 1
 Ah, that explains a lot: 1
 Yuppp... They're part of the reason why I always try to smile when I have an interaction, however small, with someone I don't know in public, it's also just nice to get a smile back: 1
 your cutie 😘: 1
 Oh... Yeah, I guess they were a lot more positive than usual 😅: 1
 Studie a class and do some assignment for Friday because last hour with the teacher: 1
 Sure, if you're up for it, don't force yourself just cause I said I'd like to call more often though: 1
 We can definitely watch Howl's Moving Castle together: 1
 Yuppp, 100% same: 1
 Thx  yeah hope they come what exactly do the talk about or what are you working on there?: 1
 It's true though. I have a terrible work ethic if I don't want to 😅: 1
 Yeah sure I'd love to make one: 1
 How was driving today and what else did you do?: 1
 Yeah, after I asked you to take pictures it occurred to me that that's not really your thing to do, don't know why I asked 😅 but thank you for the pictures! Looks like a really nice event! Glad you had a good time 😊: 1
 At this point it's less than 48 hours, but yeah, it always feels like I miss even more than usual right before we meet up again, it's crazy: 1
 Yeah good attitude. I think so too: 1
 Goodnight rabbit love you 💙: 1
 Okay sure i am ready too: 1
 Hope you don't have to wait too long: 1
 Was alright Alex came back to the apparment and we talk abit about stuff he did at home. How is/was your evening?: 1
 When is the meeting for the project?: 1
 Have fun at your parents', I hope your mom enjoys the celebrations! : 1
 So how was the fair? You enjoyed yourself?: 1
 No thank you, it's too fucking early for that 🥲: 1
 It was really damn good: 1
 Morning hon, you sleep alright?: 1
 Because your so sexy and lovely: 1
 I told my dad you told me about the football scores and now he's convinced you want to go to a game with him 😂😅: 1
 That sounds like you're the parent 😂: 1
 I called him a snitch as a joke 😅: 1
 I would love to see her try to "rizz" you up while you are in a duo costume: 1
 Probably not to be honest 😓: 1
 Yeah I though so too: 1
 But I sound really fucking bad: 1
 Tails: 1
 Oh okay, I was worried I misunderstood something 😅: 1
 True, I'm curious how other countries will react to it, my best guess is that they'll follow Germany with the final decision. Yeah, I ate lunch about an hour ago. You?: 1
 They're good, teaching my dad how to make bechamel: 1
 Is everyone's there from your group and how did there first week go. Is there intership as interesting as yours?: 1

 It was was close to the the check point Carly: 1
 No we stopped like 5 min ago. But i think i will go to sleep now we have the meeting tomorrow.: 1
 I am so proud of it, I didn't think it would actually turn into anything 😁😁😁: 1
 That is... The most infamous cafe in Ghent. I think we even have a movie about it? Never been there before but it's like a dancing/club kind of? Know several people that were kicked out though 😂: 1
 How's your day going so far love?: 1
 Nope staying home: 1
 I know what you mean feel the same way: 1
 I kinda wanna wait to tell you until it's published 😁😁😁: 1
 Yeahhh, nah. I've done a bunch of that in the past and it really isn't my thing: 1
 If everything goes well I will have an incredible (silly) achievement next week 😁: 1
 Oh what are we doing?: 1
 Honey... please take good care of yourself: 1
 Will do sorry again I taught it would take 20 mins: 1

 Man, you're the one who decides to leave you know? I'd say that's more rude: 1

 How's the festival?: 1
 *Wasn't sure: 1
 I miss covid... Good times when people wouldn't get in your personal space at the supermarket: 1
 okay think it should all work out: 1
 Its not excuse. I just really forgot. I don't wanna try to excuse myself from being a asshole: 1
 Nope, at home until my next class: 1
 It's going I guess, it's about measuring predictability and trustworthiness of an analysis: 1
 Nice to hear. My afternoon is going alright mostly relaxing to be honest. There is a free festival of our university tonight probably gone go there with Alex, Killian and Patrick.: 1
 Ahh... sad: 1
 I only have 5% left and no charger so it could be that I stop typing: 1
 Wait the song or the general idea of utopia? 😅 Hope the train ride isn't to long and if it's really bad just change seats.: 1
 How is your day going? BTW is it okay to write you while you are in class or should I wait till your done. It kinda kept me from writing you sooner today 😅.: 1
 Wait what... It was only an hour? That's pretty nice: 1
 Nevermind, class got cancelled... I live to die another day!: 1

 Well, we're all worried because we only have a month left and only have 5 interviews done so far, but we talked to Robin and he calmed us down so I think it will be alright. Thanks love 😘: 1
 The only reason I'm not having trouble sleeping is because I am so busy I am too tired to be able to think about much when I get in my bed so I totally understand it but I am blissfully able to sleep anyway 😅: 1

 Basically there's a whole database of questions that were asked by developers of some kind (part of the Internet Engineering Task Force) and an RFC is a request for comments. After it then gets ratified, it becomes a standard. Basically when it said that it is described in RFC 6960 they literally meant that X.509 is described in the RFC 6960... The database is fucking huge: 1

 Everything will be alright then 😊: 1
 Day is going alright gone be in university for a while: 1
 Finally got home. I'm dead. How're you doing?: 1

 That's crazy!: 1
 It just is?: 1
 Yeah, seems like it, they were loading up a car with a hell of a lot of stuff so we're assuming they're moving out. The only thing we don't know is whether or not the house is sold already and if so, who to, but of course we're hoping it isn't so my parents can still buy it 😅: 1
 Just take the compliment love!: 1
 Everyone was very impressed by my 546 day streak 😂: 1
 Little love letter: 1
 In that case my mom was the inspiration 😂: 1
 We are calling tonight?: 1

 I am waiting for Friday: 1
 Glad you had a good night 😊: 1
 Tried to see if my dad is right and alcohol helps with a sore throat. Either I didn't drink enough (just 3 sips) or it's bullshit: 1
 It was actually at my work, they came to visit to check on us today. They basically just asked us to showcase our progress... Which was fucking vague but I feel like I did quite a good job since she said we're doing good afterwards: 1
 So how far are you still?: 1

 Good morning love, hope you had a good night ❤️: 1
 If you think my rant is over the top please let me know: 1
 Yeah, I think I will protest against it, though it does seems really interesting to do, but probably a bit too risky when I have absolutely no experience with writing legal documents. Not entirely sure that's what he's gonna ask though, but we'll see.: 1
 Was pretty nice went to university and play a game with Marco after that. How was your day? And what's up with the blindfold think from?: 1

 Sounds good, Aeneas told me he wants to call you tomorrow. Also Jingwen is in Italy now apparently??: 1
 It sucks sometimes to be honest. I kinda wanna change that but its for some reason hard.: 1
 Crying is kinda relieving yeah, definitely. And emotions... Goddamn, that was indeed such an emotional evening, but I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world: 1
 Okay, not gonna lie, you're 100% gonna end up in a traffic jam around that time but I really hope  you don't 😅: 1
 Making me cry and all that, fucking love the bitch but why did Alex make me cry on a random as fuck Monday??: 1

 Don't you have class right now?: 1
 But honestly I don't really like home office when I'm alone, did it twice now and I lose focus really fast. It would be better if the tasks I have to do were more interesting or if there was another person home, but yeah, I think I'll keep going into the office as much as I can for this internship.: 1
 Nothing much just sime business related stuff and play games with alex: 1
 Yup, that one! It's called Future Food Tech, so it's about technology in the agrofood industry: 1

 Never be sorry for horny you 😂: 1
 I pray for your free Thursday and Friday 🙏🏼. Well if you don't have a kitch for 3 months Damm that's sucks. I mean living room okayish I guess but kitchen just straight up sucks: 1
 Yeah... I'm basically just sitting in between them listening to what exactly is going to happen and the more I hear the more I wonder what the fuck we're going to do for those 3 months because we won't be able to do anything at all downstairs? No kitchen, no living room, nothing 😅 I fucking hope it's this summer so I can work for a month and then be gone or something for the rest of it 😅: 1
 It was really nice, the coverband was really good 😊, my mom, grandpa, one of his friends and I were the only people in the VIP area actually dancing but we had a good time: 1
 Feel that 😅: 1
 Waiting again? That sucks... you're finally changing out your replacement tire and all the rest or why are you changing them for?: 1
 I would say that's kinda personal experience: 1
 I can't imagine what you and Alex look like dancing together honestly: 1
 Okay seems reasonable I guys can't really talk about no personal experience 😅: 1
 I dreamt about you last night, it was a really nice dream so I'm kinda sad I woke up 🙃: 1
 That's kinda messed up: 1
 So have fun 😘: 1
 Oi sorry mate: 1
 Question, is saying good morning to your bus driver a thing in Germany? Or do you think that's just weird?: 1
 Never get into lol it's really toxic and only fun with friends: 1
 Without me? Rude: 1
 Hmm... That could work, we have some almond chocolate milk I think: 1
 Okay so we meet up on dc?: 1
 Sounds like a perfect save places to relax: 1
 well some have special kinks: 1
 I think I will have to disappoint Alex and go with Ole... But only because he has 2 cats and nothing can beat that: 1
 You're going shopping now? Damn, didn't know stores were open that late: 1
 Carré day? What's that? : 1
 Thanks hon, I think I look like a drowned cat 😂: 1
 Meh to be honest just don't have any motivation 🥲: 1
 I one time dreamt my blanket was a slice of cheese: 1
 Went pretty well so far. Went to the Carre day of my university. And now heading back home to eat lunch. Also Alex ask how was the nicest out of my friends/the coolest?: 1
 I hope it doesn't happen today, but I think it should be fine if you feel good about it: 1
 I read that and this song started playing in my mind : 1
 nice yeah helps me and marco wihle do the merch think: 1
 6 any other weeks, I will die: 1
 I'll take a look, we're still in the same store 😂: 1
 The work went well today?: 1
 Hi! I'll propose it, do you want to be part of the movie night groupchat?: 1
 Doesn't work for my phone will try it on my laptop: 1
 Okay, thanks love 😘: 1
 Goodnight love, miss you ❤️: 1
 Went to my parents are breakfast with them chated a bit. Now cleaning my car until 11 then we drive to the book fair.: 1
 Yeah but most of the time they still drive i can also come pick you up 😘: 1
 Okay then... Will make sure there are a bunch of vegetarian starters so you can have something good to eat in case you don't like it though: 1
 Had a good night I guess. Went to work without my laptop though because I'm forgetful as hell, working from home now 😅: 1
 Thx woke up now. How is your day going and did you get new task for today?: 1
 Thanks for laughing at my misery 😭: 1
 No like the appstore tells me its not compatible with my phone: 1
 Yeah but give me 5 min: 1
 Was pretty good, for once actually didn't wake up in the middle of the night 😅: 1
 I do know that, but sometimes it's just easy to look at other things that seem to indicate the opposite, easier than ever when I'm stressed out of my mind and just in general not in a great state of mind. I just miss you a shitload and idk, I'm just looking at the wrong things making it worse: 1
 we dont need to hon: 1
 Still reading fanfictions: 1
 So essentially it's a drawing of the seconds before disaster: 1
 Sleeping soon like a hour more studying for me: 1
 The fuck is wrong with people? I would honestly do the meeting without them: 1
 How's your evening? End up going to IKEA or no?: 1
 Can't, my parents aren't home yet and I don't know the password, but will probably do so later: 1
 No it's not too big or yes it is definitely not a good fit?: 1
 With you BAP group: 1
 Gonna start looking now, might call you around 17 if that works: 1
 Continued in German until I answered in English: 1
 Its gone break? You wanna keep it?: 1
 Cant wait to see: 1
 Yeah, I'd definitely recommend if you have nothing to watch: 1
 Shitty as hell, it's raining a lot, not cold though: 1
 Nice relaxing. Mostly lol and some indie games befor with Elias: 1
 Yeah, to get into the company: 1
 I love seeing you laugh and smile, it always pretty much makes my day 😘: 1
 Sure,  but I thought you were gonna hang out with Alex later? So what is later?: 1
 From like 3 to like 11: 1
 One way to put it yeah: 1
 well next time: 1
 Now for the third time, how is your evening going? ❤️: 1
 No, I'm asking about Mannheim 😅: 1
 Are you doing anything right now?: 1
 Cheeky boy: 1
 Yuppp... Now it all makes sense...: 1
 Let me put it this way. The first one make you look hot, the second makes you look like I could take you to church: 1
 Can also text or mabye call later. But not sure when or if because i also don't know how long that goes. I know that we alos go bowling (learned that 1 hour ago): 1
 yea: 1
 3 points now 😅: 1
 Huh... Okay, thanks!: 1
 Basically my first time drinking hard liquor, or at least trying it because I took a sip and holy shit it is very fucking strong but I didn't like the taste that much 😅: 1
 Going shopping. Hope you have fun 😘: 1
 How is your day going so far did you get your stuff done and how does your hair look now? Did you get your work done?: 1
 Fair point: 1
 Also I can't believe they showed Master Chief's face in the movie... Did I watch it? no, but still it's bullshit: 1
 Yeah started 9: 1
 Sorry 😅. How are the other people on the train /kids? Whats the Fandom of the fanfictions. Yeah most of the time you can't go out exepte for real old trains or if you are in the front train part: 1
 How is your day going? Are at your university for the meeting? How else is in your group?: 1
 How so? You can always call me again if you feel like it, don't worry about it and have fun playing games 😘: 1
 You're too sweet and cute and caring and ah... I love you so much ❤️: 1
 I also got kinda lucky, it wasn't raining anymore when I cycled home 😊: 1
 Good morning hon 😘 what are you up to today ?: 1
 Oh... This reminds me of another memory... One time I stayed over at my great grandma's place and we both woke up at 5am or something so we watched the gymnastics world championships together at 5am, I really liked that: 1
 Restart can help ?: 1
 I was really tired yesterday but layed a awake for like 1 hour. Trying to sleep and only thinking about you that was hard. Miss you too 🫠: 1
 We got stuff todo and we dont know if the others will come: 1
 Yeah it really nice to see ole again. He has some problems with his cats but nothing major. Talk a lot and went playing some billiard and eat ramen for dinner after that. How was your day? How did the your first day of "real work"(not in a negative sense) go?: 1
 Back home now at my parents house: 1
 We are moving 🥳: 1
 Good morning Hon 😘. Hope you had a good night of sleep. We call Aeneas at 13 today right?: 1
 I hope you're having a good time gaming with Alex 😊: 1
 Well i geuss there goes my plan for even more kisses 😅: 1
 I did great, booked a seat in the toddler area 😅: 1
 Ah, when you try to prepare for DnD but your DM doesn't fucking answer any messages: 1
 Hope you're having a great day 😘: 1
 Sounds nice mabye if you got some pages. You could send it too me. Would love to read it. I don't know why but it kinda interests me. But normally I don't read that much and especially ot over that kinda off topic. Hope you can make sense out of this message 😅: 1
 Yeah i am now for that: 1
 Would love to have you here as emotional support though ;): 1
 Okay, thanks for letting me know : 1
 It is usually blue purple or green, right now it's purple. Least favourite is brown or orange.: 1

 Okay then nice just stay awake hon 😘: 1
 But like: 1
 Ohh 😏 well that's interesting: 1

 Yeah will let you know got want I get done. If you want we can also call later: 1
 Good morning I took a shower and didn't see the text. Some university stuff and at 13: 1

 See my point?: 1
 Okay, good luck at work 😘: 1
 Cute puppy?: 1
 Thanks hon ❤️. Hope you stay awake abit longer and have fun shopping with your mom: 1
 How was the food market? I didn't see any messages about food? ;): 1
 That reminds of the orange hoodie from your university.: 1
 You're stressed and worried? Makes sense, but like I said, the more you're hung up on it, the more you're gonna stress over it and in the end, being too stressed is what ruins a presentation most of the time (if the preparations were thorough enough I mean): 1
 I need more time I will be 10 mins late I wrote Aeneas already sorry 😅: 1
 Make yourself some good food ❤️: 1
 What did i do?: 1
 Eh, for now the child seems really nice: 1
 Yeah but still i kinda wanna get the jokes if you right them to me. Don't wanna ask everytime or get it explained in the worse case 😱: 1
 Yeah could also do that: 1
 Okay, nice, I'll let them know! 😊: 1
 You have my condolences 😢: 1
 How are you feeling though? <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Playing games with Killian and Marco. Soon a shower when it's getting abit colder and cleaning the bathroom soon: 1
 He said he can't because his last exam is the 12th: 1
 Asking can't hurt I guess: 1
 I am dead tired 😭, lunch fucked me up all I want to do is go home and take a nap 😅: 1
 Love that 😅. Like everywhere else there worried that student use it too much.: 1
 What do you want to change about your character? Does Luna play a lot of dnd. Hope you did leave jinte out of the conversation. She mabye had her hands full with navigating ☺️: 1
 Sounds nice, hope the food tastes alright 😊: 1

 That is you indeed 😘: 1
 Oh, nice, she has a lovely cat : 1
 Yeah, I've heard that's some of the main criticism people have about it too: 1
 It's more about the picture: 1
 Any plans for your free time?: 1
 Good morning, party was shit but we went to another club and played some fussball. Yeah I slept well what are you up too today?: 1
 Nothing much, just relaxing. Should probably pack my bags at some point: 1
 No it is! I would have thought it would be the opposite but you guys are doing a lot better than the West part: 1
 Hope you still dream of us soon 😘: 1
 And if I then after that didn't say I want to talk about something, we also wouldn't be talking: 1
 Yeah, have heard that the actress portrays her really well, at times she even takes over some of her characteristics in real life: 1
 No worrys please I don't mind at all. So please don't be sorry for that 🙏🏼🥰: 1
 That makes sense, hope you find out some nice things then 😘: 1

 I hope so too! 😘: 1
 Hopefully! Don't spend too much time on school, have some fun too 😘: 1

 I mean, you're part of the family so obviously you're invited, but you have exams really short after that so I get it if you don't: 1
 Pretty much everyone is gone now anyway: 1
 You want some pictures/videos?: 1
 Yeah had a weird dream but else my night was great 🥰. Any plans for today?: 1
 Last train 🥳: 1
 I'm home doing laundry, which is marginally better: 1
 Same people from last semester?: 1
 Now if only time would go a little bit faster for tomorrow, that would be great too 😊: 1
 Well i will eat you just a different way 😶: 1
 Nice if you like old trains mabye it's like the Harry Potter train?: 1
 I hope so, I know it was delayed but it could turn out cancelled who knows?: 1
 Going to sleep soon, being out 2 nights in a row until 3 is killing me 😅: 1
 Okay, but this time you're actually gonna plan something? Last time you couldn't with the guy coming to fix the sink and all so maybe this time?: 1
 But over all the party is nice some Janosch and wizzard?: 1
 Any plans for today still?: 1
 by the way: 1
 Okay but yeah you right. Still on the time schedule? You get your next train?: 1
 Idk, just randomly thought of it: 1
 Ah.... yeah that sucks, maybe you can do something else during the time or are you really having to pay attention to it?: 1
 It was called "If only it was just a play" and it was a kind of story about all the phases of life of a guy called Rinus: 1
 Yeah you right. How you got to that topic?: 1
 Okay we will see i geuss 😘: 1
 How does your day look like today?: 1
 Yeah I think so too: 1
 Love the way he forced  conversation but atleast they are good: 1
 I hope you slept alright eventually? (I'd start with good morning but I'm not really feeling it 😅) what are you up to today?: 1
 Kinda love these "spontaneously" trips 😅: 1
 Basque cheesecake?: 1
 I feel the same way, I just can't fall asleep feeling like this... I wish I could hug you or I could turn around and start kissing your shoulders, but when I turn around now it's just empty... It sucks and I already can't wait to be with you again ❤️: 1
 Aww, that sucks... I slept better yeah, hope you have a chill day so you don't have to spend too much energy: 1
 I think I believe a break: 1
 There are 3 for us: 1

 You my love 😘🥰: 1
 Good luck my love, you'll do great ❤: 1
 I think it's your turn for a question?: 1
 nah iits not trust me: 1
 Glad you had a good evening, too bad about the work though 😅 I hope it doesn't take you that much time tomorrow morning: 1
 It really is... hence why I was crying, also because it's pretty overwhelming to hear this from one of your best friends, someone you consider to be fully your equal, and then to find out they look up to you? It's... An interesting feeling. I don't know if I deserve it but I definitely appreciate it: 1
 Okay nice sounds interesting. Yeah the jealousy part wasnt really thought trough 😅.: 1
 But basically Alex made me cry because for some reason child thought it was a great moment to tell me she looks up to me and I'm one of the reasons she tries to better herself and all that and I got slightly emotional over it: 1
 This is like a weekly support meeting rather than a group work meeting, fucking love it: 1
 my Phone is dead but mabye you wanna call later or should i hype you up in someother way ?: 1
 I'll text you later 😘: 1
 What does her mom do that she needs you for business? Did she run a dinner?: 1
 Wanna call me 🥰❤️: 1
 8 is not that late: 1
 Fix your car with your dad, we can call again after that if you want 😅: 1
 I don't really, but jesus fucking christ now both of them want to hire me for marketing related business...: 1
 Sounds nice and relaxing. For me its similar prepare for school too and do something with my family. Just that at 16: 1
 I'm not gonna go, don't have the clothes for it anyway: 1
 I'm not gonna not look around for jobs or anything just because I don't have specific dreams and ambitions of course. If I find a job I like then that's great, but it's just not something I put a lot of importance in at this point: 1
 Okay I think I fuck somethink up: 1
 We just got all of our kitchen stuff from the garage to put it back. Oh, and we fought against flour moth larvae when we had to throw away some tea and herbs, I fucking hate the creatures: 1
 Yeah, some procrastination can't be avoided. : 1
 Now we are on the Belgium side: 1
 It is like crazy more dramatic how can she not realize that: 1
 For you anytime: 1
 Yeah could also be: 1
 I don't kown it would be funny for the champagne and the characters I guess: 1
 No worrys. Kinda same got so much stuff to do and I am procrasting to much ahh 😤: 1
 Crazy maybe some kids that found some or got some leftovers: 1
 Then don't procrastinate ;p: 1
 Before I forget (I suddenly think of it idk why) did you tell Alex I think he's your coolest friend now I saw his dog? And if so, what was his response? Don't have to answer right now if you wanna go to sleep, you have a busy day at uni tomorrow (if your schedule didn't change again and my memory serves me well): 1
 We're trying to tell him that what he's remembering from his dad spanking him is trauma: 1
 Sounds better will be interesting: 1
 How was the lunch in Brüssel?: 1
 May I?: 1
 Made a word pun with his name because cheese is kaas, so he said to have a cheese (Klaas) and wine evening: 1
 Still learning went shopping with Alex befor and now back at it: 1
 Love that, I'll let you know how she does then 😊: 1
 Honestly it was slightly funny: 1
 I miss you too 🥲❤️: 1
 Okay, I'll let him know: 1
 No clue what the song is honestly, if we get the video I'll send it to you: 1
 Yeah I know... I'm just done with this internship, wish it was over already but it's still another month 😅: 1
 I change my statement from before, yes you'll figure it out, but I'll be right there with you. I love you and if you need me, I'll be there ❤️: 1
 Yeah my night was fine. How was your night? And how was dance classes yesterday?: 1
 You know, I normally do have a thing with words, let's just blame it one that: 1
 Wish you were here (as always): 1
 xD it's your personal assistance: 1
 I still have to do my Duolingo... Will go to sleep after that 😅: 1
 Would you rather see Everything, Everywhere All At Once or an obscure documentary you've never heard of? Or neither?: 1
 Xtc: 1
 You want pictures and videos or rather not?: 1
 1) after her ex she is kinda traumatized when it comes to sex: 1
 Yeah I don't know what too do while you eat and I am weird 🥲: 1
 You know I really don't mind calling while I eat right? Unless you mind seeing me eat though, idk: 1
 No worrys eat in peace an then call me: 1
 Peak efficiency honey, peak efficiency: 1
 Yeah jo worries: 1
 Will see what time I'm back but yeah, could work: 1
 Nah, I know the exact reason, wasn't really good, but she didn't realise how it looked like to me, so I explained and now we're gonna meet up this afternoon on call. *communication*: 1
 Just call me when you want: 1
 Cute, sounds like a nice dream 🥰: 1
 Watching a tournament of a indie game. Gone take a shower too by myself 🥲. Later making food hopefully: 1
 Yeah I know but I just don't think I'll be able to fall asleep soon anyway, I'm too wired up: 1
 Yeah, definitely not the same without you for me too 🥲: 1
 Yeah sounds good when exactly?: 1
 Calling my cousins was weird as fuck: 1
 I knew I forgot something my dad has his b day on the 22 but it's fine: 1
 *Ready: 1
 What should I say?: 1
 I guess that person grew up in a conservative household: 1
 Be nice and maybe you will be cuddly again: 1
 Sike, that is very much impossible because I'm transferring physical data into online data : 1
 Got home: 1
 And I call a lot more people child: 1
 I would have to go to a different campus for that and I refuse to you outside: 1
 Well, if you're really lucky and I'm really stupid, Aeneas just might film it for you 😅😂: 1
 Well i dont think i could take bars or flee for them.: 1
 It's not, it's the train to Hamburg Altona: 1
 Also i would do as lomg because i need to get up tomorrow early like really early around 3 😅: 1
 She's insane: 1
 It's very fucking interesting for sure: 1
 My mom is funny. She asked what you guys have planned for the rest of tonight, I said you're meeting up with someone. My mom asked who, I said I didn't know and she then asked me if I was fine with that? As if I shouldn't be?: 1
 *Day = Date: 1
 Morning hon, hope you had a good night, hope your class is interesting 😘: 1
 Text you back soon 🫣: 1
 I'm confused sorry, you weren't thinking about the news I told you which was the guy that died or? I'm sorry I don't know what you mean 🥲: 1
 I'm not so sure about that anymore, my parking sucked and I almost got into a car crash on the way here because of my nerves: 1
 🫠🫠🫠🫠. I am melting away my love ❤️. How can one person be sooo cute ❤️: 1
 Really 😅: 1
 Good morning 😘. My night was nice dreamed about you 🥰. How way your night?: 1

 Guess who's having their armpits photographed again on Wednesday?: 1
 Turns out it tickles when someone paints your armpits 😂: 1
 Love the reaction from ur dad. I would have thought he would do something like this from how u discribe him. What nationality was he sacred of France?: 1
 They thought we were German when we checked into the hotel 😂: 1

 Oh okay so 3 /4more hours? If it gets going again: 1
 Good morning hon, I wish I could sleep more 😅: 1

 Not amazing but I'll live, Moustache is also being really annoying today 😅: 1
 I get what you mean but I never realised, sorry. You know you can tell me that too right? I don't want you to feel that way. It's interesting we both feel the same way though: 1
 Pretty sure we have the same one in dutch: 1
 They also have to make a hole in the street to fix the problem... It's fucking stupid: 1
 Sucks that it's still not gone...: 1
 No just a small one with like 10 min: 1
 Goodnight my dearest (and only) lover ❤️ <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Thanks hon, I love that <3: 1
 Apparently it was co-creation 😅: 1
 I need to find a way to make you understand when I'm being sarcastic over text, I see that now, sorry: 1
 Eh, I'm up for it, just not that big of a fan. Quite frankly I'd do worse things as a favour for family or friends: 1
 Finally 🥳: 1
 Sleep alright. Going to my parents house to spend some time with them. In the afternoon I am also paining to do the character sheets with some of the dnd campaign members. Say hey to Cato from me. Hope you two have fun while doing the schoolwork ☺️: 1
 Same 😓 but I kinda like: 1
 It just happens: 1
 Ah, Cato is non-binary so that's why: 1

 Is the question about the mom or the use of 'their'?: 1

 Good luck with the project! Working on the BAP until 17, then dance tonight. When are you planning on watching the All Star game?: 1
 Yeah well... You see, we've collectively decided that staying for 8  hours is bullshit so we're probably never going to do that + I had official business so I had a good excuse anyway! Gonna drive home now, so if you send anything I'll respond in like 10 mins 😊: 1
 Is it crunchy?: 1
 Yeah my day is going fine a little bit to much procrastination but i get back to it: 1
 Turns out I'm not done with the cookie policy yet 😅: 1
 Ridiculous: 1
 Yup, also if they're on a holiday I'd hate to disturb their relaxation time anyway: 1
 Oh the song also got some major controversies because the girl went missing and uses the TV missing report in the song crazy but nice song.: 1
 with Alex and Patrick if your mom wants to know: 1
 Well i will get there today i am pretty sure: 1

 Hope it's not an exhausting meeting: 1
 I miss you and somehow I haven't been able to stop thinking about you for the past hour, which is quite annoying because it also means I can't read my book with full attention.

 Ah, so that's why you want to go to Antwerp 😂: 1
 Btw, did you check out the thing I sent you earlier?: 1

 Yeah need to swap trains now: 1
 It is very sad... I want you with me really badly too ❤️: 1
 It was a boating service for people going to the USA leaving from Antwerp: 1

 Ups yeah sorry we got abit of stress because of the ticket think ans i forgot: 1
 The standard deviation has to be insane: 1

 You know, it would be really interesting statistical research to see what the average time between reading and answering a text is: 1
 Love you too hon 💜: 1
 But yeah, it's nice that she wants to help: 1
 Just going with early train. We weren't sure if she told everybody and alex was really worried about it and made me worried then too: 1

 Ah okas well we can do that then. Or mabye we do stuff you have allready done if there were that great?: 1
 For the record I have been to both a bunch of times and the first person who tells me they got lost in Brugge is gonna get a side eye from me, so we won't get lost, but it just means there's a lot I haven't done yet (mostly in Antwerp): 1
 What are you up too now by the way ?: 1
 I duck up my doulingo streak 🥲: 1
 I don't think I will. Don't feel like it: 1
 We can do both if you want as well, should have enough time for that 😘 (and then we don't have to choose): 1
 Okay sounds lovely 😘: 1
 Hope you're still having a good evening?: 1
 Just walked to my grandma's house to cook : 1
 I miss you hon ❤️: 1
 Ah, sounds better: 1
 Well there is no one there to distract you: 1
 About Germany colonies in Africa and Asia. Alot of stuff and really spezific. Was cool: 1
 Anyway how is preparing for the math test going ?: 1
 I hope he feels better soon, always sucks when you're feeing bad on a trip : 1
 That's the one you talk about: 1
 Still think it's stupid your tickets only count on a specific train: 1
 I'm not gonna be able to do Datenight on Thursday, sorry 😅 : 1
 Joke? Why would that be a joke?: 1
 You're cute hon, even when I don't want to do cute things with you right now 😘: 1
 You should tell my mom that, she'll have a good laugh at it 😂: 1
 It's first game night and the they watch a movue: 1
 Yeah, living room is fine, we just move that up to my room, but no kitchen... My dad and I will be bitching about it before 3 days have passed 😅 guess we'll see: 1
 Don't: 1
 Almost all full days, we're both gonna be really busy this semester: 1
 Everytime i will love too do that again and again 😘: 1
 Ja sure: 1
 Just some weird interpretation: 1
 Btw, would you mind a quick call before you go to sleep? Just wanna see your face quickly for some motivation: 1
 I wish I would be there but I got a similar dream 🥰: 1
 Idk, the only thing that usually helps is listening to music but I don't want to go down to get my headphones: 1
 Oh right nice did you do the think for your application ? just asking: 1
 But also a bit tired so probably sleep in a hour or soo: 1
 Playing games with marco, Hirsch and some other dude.: 1
 You know what we did last year?: 1
 What is your evening looking like?: 1
 Just not sleeping don't know: 1
 Unless you just want to call while we both do our thing, idk: 1
 I would fucking love a hug: 1
 Maybe I should just quit school and start working: 1
 Gone home now?: 1
 I am terrible at exams like this: 1
 Glad to hear that.: 1
 Don't want headphones: 1
 Now I'm done and I'm going home and I'm gonna eat a cookie or something: 1
 Yes alot: 1
 He does like making stickers huh?: 1
 Nice picture! From this weekend?: 1
 To be honest drugs is really the only thing I know about Antwerp: 1
 Well it's nice that she lit up. Mabye she only lit up because she looks up to you: 1
 The later it gets, the darker it gets sometimes: 1
 I'll start with the easy part... Ish? Alex and their mom are in Italy right now with a friend of the mom. The friend owns a couple of houses (man is rich) and wants to let her rent them out because right now he's only renting them out to other Italians but if she decides to go in business she can rent them out to other Europeans and take part of the profit margin. She'd need a website for that and some proper marketing = which she needs me for because for some reason Alex has been boasting my skills to her, god only knows why: 1
 Jesus that got dark fast but yeah i agree: 1
 He is only extra for you ❤️. Would do the same if you were around ngl: 1
 I seriously doubt that in this case: 1
 I am also so convinced potato and her bf meet up to fuck and barely do anything else, but it's kinda funny: 1
 Sounds like a plan😊🥰: 1
 Mabye when i am over there next month we can look together ❤️: 1
 (not saying I wouldn't appreciate a solution though, but that's not the aim, idk): 1
 That was very smooth: 1
 Yeah also afraid of them ripping. But it will happen. Geuss we will find something: 1
 Damm your still awake??: 1
 Yup definitely all sorts. But yeah they do be expensive.: 1
 Eh, idk, they're pretty expensive too and while I would wear it around my neck on a chain, I feel like people would be quick to ask questions: 1
 Yeah ii will tell you no worrys: 1
 Don't tell me it's back to 0: 1
 Goodnight precious ❤️: 1
 Cutie and will see i geuss 🥰: 1
 Well db but you got this: 1
 My most precious boy 😘🥰: 1
 Your allways have a great answer to my stuff i be doing ☺️: 1
 I knew there was a reason I love you 😜❤️: 1
 By all means I must have done a lot of good in my past life if I am so absolutely lucky to get to be with you now: 1
 But i am going to sleep now: 1
 I think about doing more love letter stuff to be honest its a nice way to express my self to you 🥰: 1
 Shit happens though: 1
 Kinda interesting will tell you more later. Right now on my way back to chemnitz: 1
 Never knew watching Alex create a Tinder profile would be this interesting 😂... So much unnecessary information and then "oh my god there's so many pretty people": 1
 Yeah, not there yet, but so far it's really nice : 1
 Thought so because well its really nice but it also gets complicated once you actually need to get it pretty and reliable on everything: 1
 yeah but like.. where is the blood coming from though?: 1
 Yeah no, I should remind myself of that when talking to you 😅 talking to you is much easier than anyone else, which someone makes me realise how much I overanalyse most people talking to me: 1
 Sometimes I wonder why I ask because that is the answer 90% of the time 😂: 1
 Gentse feesten you mean? Yeah, but also because you now have 2 exams in 3 days, that's a lot: 1
 Overwatch: 1
 And my bachelor thesis was on female entrepreneurs: 1
 Any reason why you're asking it this way?: 1
 Ah okay yeah not that complex: 1
 Not feeling great in what way headache ?: 1
 Of course great timing for my touchpad to stop working too 🙃: 1
 I know I didn't but it's just... Urg, I miss you and I'm very glad the bedsheets still smell like you: 1
 Cutie, it's very comfy: 1
 That's what I'm going for: 1
 Without you? I don't think that's a threat 😘: 1
 Hope you don't get to wet in the shower 😘: 1
 That's what the shower is for kinda, a restart: 1
 Dont know both kinda like don't feel that terrible and start a spiral down words. Is kinda what i wanna say: 1
 Are you saying I shouldn't feel terrible or you don't feel terrible? Because I don't know what to respond to either of those statements honestly: 1
 Hope it works, gonna take a shower now though, I feel terrible 😅: 1
 Ah, our days were comparable then so far: 1
 Just wanna write it again: 1
 Much better for that not to be that case though 😅: 1
 Okay I totally thought you were: 1
 Once again thank you very much for the fox: 1
 Ah, so you didn't get sent back to 0?: 1
 Yeah, sounds like it: 1
 Yeah i duck up 1 day: 1
 My mom's client just randomly coming into the living room while I look like a hobo and am studying, always great 🙃: 1
 Their trip to Italy and some friends we have, a party Alex is going to, all that: 1
 Really good dream 🥰: 1
 Goddamn we really do have one brain cell sometimes: 1
 Cant wait to see you hon ❤️: 1
 Ah man... Just 3 more hours and you're here, can't wait: 1
 Don't think that's a great idea, because that decreases the self confidence she has right now I think: 1
 Reading that also made me smile 😊: 1
 She works there. She is a part-time bartender: 1
 Yeah, it's fine, I have good headphones: 1
 Man thats the most hypt up party i have go to then: 1
 Also because it took so long I couldn't go back home for my backpack so I bored some paper from Jinte and a pen from Celine, It's quite sad 🥲: 1
 Food: 1
 I lost your hair tie and I'm definitely not freaking out about it. I'm also too tired to go looking for it so I'm just gonna try to go to sleep.: 1
 Can't wait either 😊: 1
 Ooohhh, nice, that's earlier than I expected 😁🥳: 1
 Didn't happen, he's the only chiropractor in the building, which is why I had to wait outside for so long until my mom could pick me up 😅: 1
 I hope it's not reserved then 😅: 1
 Ggf.: 1
 Okay yeah its says mabye reserved: 1
 Sorry i wanna the play like a kinda brat: 1
 It should be on the seat no?: 1
 Till now yeah but don't know if its reserved 😶: 1
 Because I was a bit worried that today would be a very busy travel day: 1
 What's up?: 1
 Yeah, that's fair: 1
 But not open jet: 1
 Great! It's already there??: 1
 Cutie knows what i want to hear 😘: 1
 Studying still?: 1
 Gone sleep so I can dream about you see you in my dreams 😘: 1
 The i geuss you need to wait till i get there. Or till you pick me up 😘: 1
 I miss read so much its crazy: 1
 Any other ideas for over the phone... Hmm, I don't knox: 1
 I think this can definitely be arranged: 1
 Yeah, it's all Wout, Stijn, Seppe, Brecht, etc.: 1
 Well i allways wanted to see you not where any except my sweeter and pants: 1
 About your texts totally get your feelings especially when i am on a holiday and dont text as much. The skiing trip is also way more time consuming then i thought to be honest. Its like spending time with the group every waking minute. Its not something bad just alot sometimes. <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Not so difficult when it's also what I want to say 😘❤️: 1
 Lars cancelled so Jinte cancelled too, and then I went and saved Alex because they forgot their wallet and couldn't get out of the parking garage 😅: 1
 Sounds nice hope you have a great time 🥰: 1
 You're making me blush: 1
 Yeah thanks hon 🥰: 1
 That is very true 😘: 1
 Like i will you over the couch: 1
 Folding some laundry: 1
 I don't know them, this is just from hearsay but still: 1
 Uh... We were planning a family trip, then my dad got a motorbike and I was borrowing it. While I was driving back from a carnival I had to stop at a red light, a guy on a motorcycle then stopped next to me, wanted to race, I said I didn't feel comfortable with that, he taunted me but in the end somehow was talking to me the whole ride, then we decided to stop at a small grocery store, he was kind of giving me the creeps though, he "joked" about stealing some thing, I waited outside, trying to figure a way to lose him. He then robbed the grocery store and killed the security guards, while I was trying to escape: 1
 Sounds nice how is work going still reading invitations?: 1
 Wanna chat abit 🥰: 1
 Not gonna lie, I like the train but those last couple of hours always feel like eternity: 1
 I have no clue how he wants to do it or why he wants a tesla: 1
 What are you up too in the while i trust the db eay to much?: 1
 Good morning, I see you woke up around 6 again, I hope the rest of your night was good though 😘: 1
 Yeah, I can imagine that's kind of weird: 1

 Okay good 😘: 1
 This is gonna be so slow now 😭: 1
 Thanks muffin 😘: 1
 Or that you can get to bed early: 1
 And independent: 1

 A bit tiring.: 1

 If you wanna too we can also call later? Making food right now: 1
 Good, going to the city to go to the Christmas market : 1
 Well mabye we are not going 😅: 1
 If you don't think I realise that was a joke then idk how many jokes I've missed that made you think I'm this oblivious 🥲: 1
 As long as no one is annoying that's all that matters honestly: 1
 I heard something happening so I went to check it out, helped her unlock it : 1
 (oh yeah, and Aeneas is dating): 1
 Didn't talk to anybody except the instructor 😅. Headphones on and also busy mostly.: 1
 How's the traveling going?: 1
 I can't wait either 🥰❤️: 1
 I guess so indeed: 1
 Was playing lol and now driving back: 1
 It feels kinda nice to hang up on you for fun 😝🤭: 1
 Hope you get to go to sleep soon then: 1
 There's 3 stops in Brussels, so make sure you get off the right one: 1
 But yeah better than an B&B, I walk in the park where we were before because we already were there and something I can't remember: 1
 Honey, okay I do not know what you're up to, and I don't expect an answer when you're busy, but I do expect an answer ya know? 😅: 1
 Okay, can definitely do that ❤️: 1
 In the end its my sweeter but i would also love to see you in the christmas style at some point 🙏🏼🥺❤️: 1
 Let me know when you've decided then 😘: 1
 Well, kinda took a nap (basically closed my eyes for an hour but didn't actually sleep), Aeneas is just watching tv or something, my dad is taking an actual nap: 1
 We are now at the Friedrichpalast and the show starts in 38 min: 1
 You're at home now?: 1
 There was a watershow??? And trampolines? That almost sounds like a Cirque du Soleil performance: 1
 Yeah back to studying 😅. Hope you have some nice podcast to listen to while you work: 1
 Damn, that is a giant room: 1
 You also really don't sound that German: 1
 Yeah thought I would forget something: 1

 It was a field full of fireflies 😊 they only moved because of the wind, was really cool: 1
 Oh my god, that sounds fucking exhausting: 1
 Let me guess, last train? 😂😜: 1
 Now in the train to Leipzig we got a bit lucky: 1
 Its a odd coincidence: 1
 Is it like a "thing" in your friend group to have exactly 5 posts or is that just Fabian and Alex? It's an odd coincidence: 1
 You got this hon 🥰: 1
 Tried to have a conversation in German with Jinte, showed me that somehow my German theory might be better but goddamn my accent is a problem: 1
 So Fabian found my Instagram account I am guessing: 1
 Ohh i don't think that's good way 😢: 1
 Yeah we can call tonight after i made dinner ? in 30 mins: 1
 Oh right you told me how is the whole think mabye some pictures (of you also mabye 🥺) <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 You're back in Chemnitz now or still on the way?: 1
 I trying to. Child 😝: 1
 Thanks for the clarification 😂: 1
 Okay that makes sense, that's a youth movement group: 1
 Goddamn: 1
 The ending was really nice, but a bit too happy if that makes sense?: 1
 Yeah it's the german rail road system. Ever german hates it. But mabye your train in Frankfurt is delayed too. Actually likely to be honest: 1
 Elias: 1
 About the openness and the future of us. Its abit weird but yeah i don't how to describe over text: 1
 Just Claire and my mom, but that's it 🥲 and my mom stopped because there's not enough people dancing: 1
 Also have the largest diamond industry in Europe there (if I'm not mistaken) and a large Jewish community that is very involved with that diamond industry: 1
 Good boy, would have been fine just annoying: 1
 When on Saturday do you leave?: 1
 Yeah but only abit. Yeah like all day: 1
 Soon in Brüssel like 13 min and then last train: 1
 That would be crazy but i don't think so: 1
 Haven't heard from you in a while: 1

 Just for the record hon, if you get here and you don't feel like this or you're tired or something, we don't have to do shit tonight okay?: 1

 Thanks hon texting with you also gives me energy. Was missing that through the day to be honest: 1
 They're alright, but Belgian and Swiss (I have to admit they're pretty alright) are better as far as my preferences go: 1
 Brugge is pretty small so no need for that, it's just kinda a cute small city: 1
 Taking a shower will probably feel great though, might give you a bit more energy, but I totally get the lack of energy: 1
 I haven't cried since before you left but god knows I might at any moment I'm by myself, nevermind if I'm out under any amount of stress 😅: 1

 Not like there's much to influence though, we'll just have to see who she takes home next: 1
 Good morning my love. Yeah seems like it. Nothing much just university and going shopping now. What are you up too at work?: 1
 I guess maybe France, Germany or Luxemburg right over the border would be fine, but she was already worrying that Brussels was too far soooo, perhaps not: 1
 But I definitely won't be on time for my train in Frankfurt: 1
 Our of principal: 1
 Gonna actually go to sleep now though, I have a date with my cousin Cato tomorrow 😊: 1
 I know hon, and I love you, but I do not wish a long distance relationship on my best friend, because it's not easy. And I think she deserves easy after the bullshit love life she's had so far: 1
 Hope you're right, except the not from Belgium part: 1
 Cutie but else anything interesting happend: 1
 Still have to talk to the people: 1
 Ah yeah: 1

 Btw, I was looking up the lego miata set and I think it's made up 😅 couldn't find it at all: 1

 Some way?: 1
 Good luck in class 🍀: 1
 Sadly aware of that: 1
 Yeah, she broke up with him for that: 1
 Yeah but honestly not as much as you probably think. I am really lazy if I don't wanna do something but we can try sorry 😅.: 1

 Damm okay sucks will send you virtual hugs and kiss. Also my energy: 1
 Told her that next time she should go for someone who is from a country with a red flag so maybe this time she's not attracted to the personality red flags😂: 1
 Haha... Good joke: 1
 My dad is a trickster btw, told me we were gonna run 3km but ended up going 5...: 1
 And the statistics homework comes first, apparently it takes a while: 1
 Yeah... I'm also worried about them, Anthony is sick, Jingwen is apparently also getting sick again and Aeneas... Is just really not looking forward to going back home again. I felt bad when he spent the day with my family because he said he felt jealous and I didn't really know how to handle that. I'll definitely ask him to hang out tomorrow though, I'm going back to fantoft to clean up but we could probably play some pool as well and just hang out: 1
 Damm sucks hope to nights sleep will be nice. How is your week after tomorrow at least a bit relaxing till your birthday?: 1
 Surly 😘: 1
 Yeah would also think it would be a friend and not a random person: 1
 I really can't look at math right now though: 1

 Even during lunch we worked on the group project: 1
 Anything planed for the rest of the day?: 1

 Now I have to waste another half hour here... What shall I do?: 1
 Our shampoo is almost gone (god knows I use way too much of it but it smells like us so yeah, I feel justified) and I hate it: 1
 And you can bend me over and spank me whenever you feel I'm being bad (or good): 1
 Damn hon, you're really horny huh?: 1
 Okay i will be prepared: 1
 Yeah, now I'm on the pill for more than 3 months the side effects shouldn't really show up anymore so I'm quite happy that I don't really have any real side effects: 1
 Being abit slutty suits you 😘: 1
 But i would also love for you to be bad so i would start spanking you or mabye you would start not wearing any underwear well there is a lot of possibility for ypu to secretly start abit: 1
 That's great i would also be a bit confused if that would happen and not engage in somw of the aktivatis: 1
 You know, I keep hearing people say that once you're on birth control your sex drive totally disappears or something but I definitely don't have that issue 😅: 1
 Man talking about sex with you makes me kinda Horry: 1
 Yeah, I think we've improved quite a lot since then: 1
 Yeah first time was nice but wouldn't like to go back <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Quite frankly hon, while I look back quite fondly on your first time, I think losing my virginity one time was quite enough: 1
 That's good! We just ate brunch... 😂 Yeah, I'm still working on the German book. Wanna call later and compare books if you have time? Enjoy the coffee and tea, I actually just read about that in the book! 😁: 1
 Well I would take your virginity as often as you want 🥵: 1
 Something about renewing your pledge to god and abstaining from sex again as if you're a reborn virgin, it's fucking weird 😅: 1

 But they are nice people: 1
 You know I need a good spanking: 1
 Mhh: 1
 Really i was: 1

 Yeah with a good reason: 1
 I will mabye actually enjoy it then just to tease you and play with you: 1

 Even the picture he sent her was "Oh shit, sorry, meant to send that to Jana, both your names kinda look the same" <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Wasn't great but I guess she's not entirely wrong: 1
 Damm what a fucked up relationship: 1
 About this? No don't think so because he's never outright done something: 1
 München looks so green! 🍀: 1
 Did she talked with her cousin?: 1
 Also I asked around for multicultural advice and the general consensus (not counting Gerardo) is that I should definitely bring a present when meeting your parents so if you have any suggestions they're more than welcome 😅: 1
 And now today he sent er a message essentially saying she is very nice 😏😏: 1
 Yeah, but always during exams. Gonna meet up after them for sure and talk about everything: 1
 Don't laugh at me too 😭: 1

 3rd places 🥳: 1
 But it is still sad: 1
 I mean, not gonna lie, the whole story about their landlord is really interesting, but I really don't care about their inventory 😅: 1
 Yeah but no, the party would be until tomorrow so it's a bad idea if I still want to study tomorrow 😅: 1
 Okay ish, I don't feel great which is reflecting in how well I'm doing in schoolwork: 1
 It hurts or it feels weird?: 1
 She is way too sweet she definitely doesn't have to do all that, I love your mom 🥺: 1
 Thanks hon and if something happens i will forget it when your here anyways 😘: 1
 not because she failed at engineering, just because it was boring: 1
 My cousin probably does... Wait, I'm gonna check who is participating and if I actually know anyone: 1
 Alex just invited me to the party she is going to tonight because someone else can't go and I am sorely tempted to say yes but I should study 🥲: 1

 There's a whole thing behind it, young adult is usually well written but doesn't cover or go in depth on difficult topics, and of course their main demographic is teenagers and young 20s, then you have new adult which has a bit more spice, and then you get to fiction and non-fiction.

 Just that after delaying it so much now you all really have to get shit done: 1
 I would hope not of me, then what would be the point?: 1
 Yeah, I did feel that way, but I also didn't want you to not be up to date on what was happening with your project so I just decided to do something else because you were busy and not really talking to me. Idk what else we could have done though: 1

 But i like you being a noob and your ass 😘: 1
 I Don't think do: 1
 I want to find time with you too, but because we have so little time together I want it to be just us, if that makes sense? No checking emails or talking to other people unless it's urgent (obviously) because right now it's a bit too big of a whiplash every time we are together and then when we're not. When we're together I feel like we're focussing pretty much only on each other and when we're apart it feels like the opposite is happening and I don't like that: 1
 I get that i feel the same way also want to ask you for a picture 😅: 1
 For you because we still have different lives but i wanna find time with you: 1
 Yeah feel that mabye we need to try to find something that relaxes us both and we like and we could do together?: 1

 For my dad perhaps, but no clue where we would put the thing, especially because it needs some extra love and care to bring it back to life: 1
 How's your evening been so far?: 1
 Will do, but I doubt there will be any actual updates on this one: 1
 Me neither 🥰: 1
 Yeah we were planning befor but weren't sure but yeah: 1

 I'll definitely do that, but red flags are kinda hard to find when you don't meet the people, that I do know unfortunately: 1
 Yeah please 🥰😘: 1
 The ice-cream looks good: 1
 Sometimes I feel happy it's not that far, but in general I still despise it: 1
 Good morning I guess? 😘: 1
 (for real, don't take anything I said seriously, I'm not in my right mind right now): 1
 Also happy about the distance a bit more: 1
 (I also have 2 fucking huge assignments I still have to do though, but shhhh): 1

 She's going to the police tomorrow, I'm not sure what kind of insurance she has honestly: 1
 Went to a mtg tournament: 1
 Probably yeah, might see if we can grab a drink or something after our last exam: 1
 Really but her bike ? just insurance ?: 1
 This in combination with Anthony and Aeneas (especially the first one) and alcohol made it so I had to de-escalate a situation that might have led to a fight at the end of the night: 1
 German😅: 1
 There is allways something going on in Alexs life its crazy. Also the child support kinda sucks.: 1
 nice but damm did she lock it =: 1
 But also their motorbike got stolen: 1
 Yeah just hoping i am not procrastinating too much 😅: 1
 Alex gave me a major life update today: 1
 Eating and playing some games.: 1
 I will love when and where ever we meet: 1
 But I can't stand the presentators 😅: 1
 If I miss my next train I'll be stuck in Duisburg... Again... I do not want to be stuck there again: 1
 I figured that would be the case, there's too much going on anyway: 1
 Okay nevermind was just one thing ony mind: 1
 Yeah that's what I wanted to say too but in a more extreme way i se now: 1
 Why would I complain about you when I can just tell you how I feel and we can resolve it in a healthy communication way as we've done so far?: 1
 Yeah, I doubt 1 person more or less will matter much with the other 35 😂: 1
 And any plans for the others: 1
 There's some people that want to complain about their partners but I'm definitely not one of them: 1
 Ah i see you are that kind of person i suspect it but wasnt sure: 1
 So I'm honestly proud of her for that: 1
 Definitely not the case: 1
 If you want me not to read them oe quit the dd because its a save space or you want some room tell me any time: 1
 Yeah, I really hope so too, we'll just have to make up for the missed hugs and kisses when we see each other in less than a week 😘: 1
 Still, if there's ever anything bothering you that you want a second opinion on before talking to me, please don't hesitate to use the group: 1
 I don't really want to talk about that though: 1
 There's really not a lot to say other than just being exhausted and not feeling good about anything I've done so far during this whole exam period, nevermind the exam that I have to take on Friday: 1
 So in between: 1
 Not fainting anymore: 1
 I'm just missing your stupidly handsome face: 1
 Negative side is that you won't be there anymore though: 1
 If anyone from there actually follows me I will be hella surprised: 1
 They were quite nice: 1
 Idk about what: 1
 Let me know how it is when you read more then: 1
 Mabye some inaudible moans or crunts: 1
 Bitch you better not: 1
 What movies did you watch today? And how did the cookies turn out?: 1
 I want you so bad: 1
 Awww okay 🥲: 1
 That's the song, but I hope they put the performance video online soon as well, it looked really nice! : 1
 The fuck: 1
 Your going straight to bed now?: 1
 Thats all: 1
 For me it's winter in the Nordics, but autumn in Belgium, specific, I know 😅: 1
 You don't even know what I have to do so how would you know?: 1
 (but yes please): 1
 I would have been dead anyway: 1
 Evening is going okay, yeah, mostly some foolery in the dc: 1
 So who took the initiative?: 1
 Yeah but i could have just wrote good... 😂: 1
 Honey... If I didn't text you asking how your day is going we wouldn't even be talking: 1
 Guess so!: 1
 Scrolling up?: 1
 Nah not really: 1
 You got this no worries. You just need to be calm and collected.: 1
 And maybe I'm being clingy today, but meh: 1
 How is you feel tonight before the exam?: 1
 Also how are you keeping the stockings up? With garters?: 1
 I'll figure it out, no worries: 1
 Good to hear: 1
 It's quite popular apparently: 1
 Your still feeling like that?: 1
 Trust me, it tastes nothing like it 😅: 1
 Insta ramen but a bit of vegetable in there and some hard boiled egg: 1
 Idk what brought it on: 1
 Would say I have yeah: 1
 I would if there was anything but I don't think so? But thanks for the offer hon ❤: 1
 Yeah, get that: 1
 Mabye chocolate milk as a alternative?: 1
 if i can help tell me 🥰: 1
 I am kinda really worried now: 1
 Okay, on my way: 1
 Hmm, maybe but that also sounds like a waste of time when I have to study: 1
 Perhaps this is PMS, who the fuck knows?: 1
 Mabye a walk can help or social interaction ?: 1
 For me it's the same, just what works better for you honestly: 1
 Procrastinating abit to much right now but else fine: 1
 Hope your lunch in nice: 1
 yes 100%: 1
 What are you reading?: 1
 Else how is your day going hon ?: 1
 Nah, my mom goes to the doctor when she's worried about something: 1
 Reading abit qnd now watching some you tube videos. But i will probably go to sleep soon.: 1
 For no reason whatsoever: 1
 Cute boy: 1
 Nice looks good: 1
 Just to go if it would grow or something like that: 1
 You don't go to the doctor for that bump on your neck either: 1
 Yeah i see: 1
 Don't forget to stop every once in a while, be safe: 1
 Well i dont type that oftem so i domt think i will ask to join the channel. But please tell me when there are interesting storys: 1
 Hope your day is going well hon, Celine and I are designing cars during marking class 😅: 1
 Ah okay nevermind them: 1
 But now Anthony has more time to create a character if he wants to join us. And jingwen said  we are going in a dungeon that's gone be a lot of fighting and some level ups on the way: 1
 I'm serious: 1
 What does that mean 🥲: 1
 Yeah basically: 1
 Question... You ever gone to a really fancy restaurant?: 1
 Never found out what causes it: 1
 Eventually it will pass: 1
 But I've had this before: 1
 Done with university for today or atleast i am back home. How is your day going my love ❤️?: 1
 Yeah yeah I know: 1
 And then you tell me my sleep schedule is fucked?: 1
 Oh dear lord... That is an awful idea but so good at the same time... 😁: 1
 Can't wait either 🥰: 1
 Can't wait to see you again: 1
 Well, at least spend some time there, try to have fun and I hope you get to sleep well tonight hon 😘: 1
 No i get what you mean. It's like a part is missing and i also want it to be there.: 1
 Just like, in general I wish I could be there for you more, because I can give you kind words and reassurance but I can't physically be with you and just, idk, support you in general. It's maybe weird to think this about something like falling asleep, but still: 1
 I wish I could do more for you. Not just now, in general: 1
 If you say so: 1
 Okay its fine trust me 😘: 1
 Paresa? Parmesan?: 1
 With out a lullaby 🥲: 1
 Okay i will try to sleep again: 1
 No no, I hope we fall asleep at the same time and then end up in each other's dreams 😘: 1
 I can't do it, I'm sorry, I don't like how I sound at all 😅: 1
 yeah should have done that fuck: 1
 Also alex got me to turn on my pc so i will probaply play some mine craft but only a hour today: 1
 And... I think they changed the lyrics because damn, the lyrics are literally "you're mother and father are monkeys": 1
 Okay I just looked up the lyrics of one of the lullabies I thought my parents would sing to me: 1
 No idea but explain that to me another time please: 1
 Let's not lie about this, my sleeping schedule is way too fucked up for me to be able to sleep now anyway: 1
 Idk, we can talk a bit, we could call, you always get tired after that 😭😅: 1
 If we do really bad it we will not watch for long at all 😂: 1
 How you would help?: 1
 Haha... Haha, funny: 1
 I 100% get what you mean with that. It always feels great to talk to someone after a long time and it seems like nothing changed at all in the way you get along: 1
 Just for the record, is it okay if I flirt just to cause chaos and embarrassment with someone that 1) knows I'm in a relationship I'm very happy with and 2) is in a relationship they're very happy with?: 1
 Yes, good boy ;): 1
 Ah woman loving woman: 1
 I am trying: 1
 For you? Yes: 1
 Did you ask because you wanted to call? Just curious: 1
 Sounds fun, but if it's in German I can not promise to be of any value whatsoever 😂: 1
 Its okay happens but just try: 1
 Eh, doubt it, this is gonna suck, but I am happy about it: 1
 Sorry hon was driving to Leipzig hanging out with Alex and Patrick: 1
 Also I have been in this discord only 2 days, why are like 3 couples already on the brink of breaking up 😭: 1
 I am not, my mom came in and is doing some work now...: 1
 Love you too hon 😘. Hope you got some good sleep 🥰: 1
 And I would hope it's not just yours, but our relationship 😘: 1
 Talk about his relationship alot and mine. Also about work and all. A few problems and all but else really nice: 1
 Not good but you know that: 1
 Just like she wants to give the kids the last name of the king. She just says "I am a woman" thats the reason xD <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Was really nice. Finally someone to talk about relationship with: 1
 Elias yeah was great been back since a hour ago: 1
 My day is okay, procrastinating a bit too much but at least one assignment will be done today, so that's a good start: 1
 No nightmare, but slept shitty and I feel sick/nauseous today 😅: 1
 How was your night? Nightmare again?: 1
 Remember that cousin of mine that is in a band? Apparently he doesn't play banjo (unfortunately) but bass instead... Dudes are actually good, I'm impressed 😅: 1
 Also happy to hear that and sad at the same time: 1
 I agreed with her that Drahomyr sometimes sounds like a bot and the girl is annoyed with me that Draho responded to me: 1
 Why what happend ?: 1
 They all wanted a longer holiday 😅: 1
 I should be studying 😭: 1
 Really tell me more ?: 1
 Yeahhhh, some people are kind of savage on this one: 1
 People just freaking out over what time it is and that their partner hasn't sent a message yet 😭: 1
 You just like the drama, I see 😂😘: 1
 Sorry if I'm spamming you btw: 1
 Just said that he's not a groomer.: 1
 Have a nice shower 😘: 1
 or after all this you mean ?: 1
 Man... She's not having it: 1
 What the fuck is this shit 😭: 1
 It's not that interesting. To be quit honest it sucks. I have zero motivation to do it: 1
 She doesn't know his name 😭😭😭: 1
 Crazy cant read shit on the site but looks really nice kinda interested to see the auction online: 1
 Told her to research grooming, very good: 1
 Nope a company: 1
 Thank the Lord for Drahomyr: 1
 Man, Yunah... This child... Doesn't have any friends or family she can rely on, only her bf... And you're telling me he got together with her when she was 14... This is textbook grooming 😭: 1
 But I get if you feel uncomfortable with that though: 1
 Ready to call 😅: 1
 Dont you know it 😘: 1
 Good luck hon 😘🍀: 1
 I would be ready to call: 1
 Yes hon i am sure ❤️: 1

 Else spending time with you doing anything really: 1
 Thanks, I probably need it: 1
 Yeah dont wanna be the reason to be honest 🥲.: 1
 Okay, interesting: 1

 Dont think its gonna work. I will distract you for sure 😅: 1
 Okay good decision 😘: 1
 Eh, just studying so okay: 1

 Going alright, in class with Alex and Celine now, it's quite entertaining 😅: 1
 Of course, we showed each other pictures and all that, her cosplay is much better than mine is: 1
 Did you tell her about your mad hader cosplay?: 1
 We both like Alice in Wonderland for cosplay and then for books just anything we like I guess?: 1
 Yeah Sounds good I have no idea what my dad would like thought: 1
 I am 100% going to treasure this picture forever: 1
 Okay sounds good: 1

 Nope why?: 1
 Hahah, would be funny if you did: 1
 + decorative lights: 1
 Let me know how it is if you go 😊: 1
 Is it your Alex's birthday today too?: 1
 I also think Alex would like the shop a lot too, with his newfound passion for tea. Apparently there's a shop in Leipzig and they do tea tastings, idk if he'd like that or not but I thought it's interesting: 1
 Sucks hope you get sleepy soon. Maybe think about sleepy kittens 🥰: 1
 Oh, and go on a really nice trip. Probably buy really good presents for my family that year too: 1

 Trust me I know that already: 1
 But the solving think is allways the first thought in my brain just saying: 1
 I know that hon its the same form me. But i glady your telling me: 1
 The brain does what the brain does 😅: 1
 I don't want or need you to solve it. I want you to understand me and how sometimes your actions affect me. That's all: 1
 I specifically told you not to: 1
 Well I don't really have another option do I?: 1
 Some days I think it's unfair and unreasonable how much I love you and how I am looking forward to a future with you. It feels unfair because somehow this feeling overwhelms me and I don't know what to do with it other than hope that it will be just as nice as I can imagine. It feels unreasonable because how can I love one person so much? How can I crave your love, attention and presence in my life like no one else's before you? : 1
 I will reconsider: 1
 I am sorry just saying that: 1
 Next time you're here I'll take you to get some 😘: 1
 I love it instead: 1

 Mostly books and cosplay: 1
 What are you doing on this ungodly hour?: 1
 Yeah kinda Student party and well there are not many uni around us <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 But other than that it doesn't do much for the way I feel because that is based in my feelings for you, which are not at all changing because I'm suddenly talking about relationships with random people: 1
 How are things going with his fiancee?: 1
 So basically: 1
 Sorry in lecture right now will write you later 😅: 1
 Oh really tell me about her and what you talk about?: 1

 I don't care what you do but I will stay up for 20 more minutes: 1

 How can anyone leave this??: 1
 Okay i am ready: 1
 Nice, have a good time with your parents! I'll send you what I'm working on but I'll go through the theory first I think. The only issue I have now is that I have to get up to get some things I need but Moustache just came in and is now laying beside me and I feel bad for leaving him now 😅🥲: 1

 Got up toke a shower and shaved now getting ready to drive to my parents house. Nice hope you can concentrate for a while. Can you send me your task you will study kinda interested in them. Love you hon ❤️: 1

 (who is secretly just Alex): 1
 Damn, that's still 2 hours??: 1
 Yeah but we are in the second half so like 15 something: 1
 Still prefer it to be just us, for the record, but I honestly don't have that big of an issue with it. As long as they speak English or at least try 😅 otherwise I will probably feel left out the whole time, not gonna lie: 1
 In class looking at the presentation of the others: 1

 Your sweater smells like you... So I'm scared to wear it so the smell would leave 😅: 1
 Food is okayish but it's cheap so pretty good.: 1
 Why have the meeting in the first place then??: 1
 You went out by the way ?: 1
 Nah, I think I'll just think about hugging and cuddling you 😘: 1
 Yeah but "i wanna do more the just the story". Kinda feels like there iis only the main story to follow: 1
 Yeah mostly hearing it from you though 😅: 1
 I also wanna talk more with npc for more then the story: 1
 was really nice I like the the combat overall. Only at the ende it kinda got through that you and alex where done and just wanted it to end.: 1
 How did you like DnD today?: 1
 Started when Cato asked what I associate with Tabasco and I said tornadoes: 1
 What tell me more: 1
 hehe you too: 1
 Playing diablo with alex: 1
 Merry Christmas hon❤️: 1
 The difference between DnD last week and this week is crazy: 1
 What are you doing now then? Just relaxing?: 1
 Was nice done now so driving back: 1
 How'd it go?: 1
 Ah yeah i see: 1
 What... Hope it's not too boring: 1
 Its gonna be later 🥲. They move it back by an hour or so: 1
 How is your plan for today ?: 1
 Yeah, I'll live: 1
 Sounds nice, I only just got home 😅: 1
 No, the date is sick right now apparently: 1
 Yup, already at work and bored, but listening to music today so that's better! You've got classes and studying today?: 1
 Celine just left, turns out the whole 'norway felt like a dream' thing is universal! She's doing good though, leaving for Ireland in February.: 1
 Nice did she meet up with her tinder date yet?: 1
 And eat a shitload of chocolate: 1
 Sounds like a good plan! I'm probably gonna call Alex: 1
 You gave me a nice idea i will also just eat alot of icecream tonight and work abit to get my mind free 🥰: 1
 Hope the lunch with your grandparents got you up atleast abit. But yeah i was/still am  feeling down. Its really crazy how i thought i would be fine when you leave 😅🥲: 1
 Same though miss that alot actually: 1
 Class was pretty annoying, and I was feeling down all day so I just bought a shitload of chocolate to hopefully make up for it (doubt it though): 1
 You also need to sleep? 😘😅: 1
 Ooh, nice! I love mushroom soup, hope you enjoy it 😘 You're making it from scratch?? That's so cool!: 1

 Okay, nice 😘: 1
 Well it wasnt long and the rest isn't that interesting so i am omw home.: 1
 Yeah, I get it, just some motivation to actually keep doing the thing I need to do and not wander off and do something else. yeah, the company is pretty cool: 1
 Yeah but i understand: 1
 Fuck my Duolingo: 1
 You're absolutely right, enjoy the walk <3: 1
 Well yeah alot of poisons can get you in a "high state". Which makes alot of sense: 1
 I knew it could be deadly, but apparently you can also get high which is new news too me: 1
 he is also shutting down his emotions...: 1
 Whatever you think is best I guess? As long as you don't forget it's DnD at 7 ;): 1
 Nope, tried to fix it: 1
 I did dream about you last night though, that was pretty nice: 1
 Nah your ego needs to grow alot more until you need to worry about that: 1
 damm how isnt that like common Knowledge ?: 1
 Yeah did the same 😅: 1
 Partially: 1
 Keep it that way: 1
 Great have a hangover though: 1
 Strangely enough it was about new year's, but we were sleeping in a different bed instead of my own... Let's just say we were having fun 😘: 1
 Yeah burnt my tongue though 🥲: 1
 Looks pretty good to me! Tastes good too?: 1
 Okay, bit behind on studying though, so that kinda really sucks, but I feel alright: 1
 Send me a picture when it's done please?: 1
 Any source or webpage for it: 1
 Does it seem from the message Alex sent me like that was the only thing you said?: 1
 Just to short while though: 1

 But thanks 😘: 1
 No problem ❤: 1
 Love your knowledge about cooking ❤️: 1
 Thought so yeah, just wanted to give you the option: 1
 I just had to take Alex's brother's bra off and it is definitely more difficult to do it for someone else: 1
 I figured it out!!: 1
 Yeah my afternoon is nice. You can use his email too subscribe to some magazines online.: 1
 Good morning yeah I slept alright. How about you? Hope you have a great day too: 1
 You can also do it a bit differently and confit the garlic and mushrooms in oil for a week or 2 and then blend them up, but depends on what you want: 1
 do please its the most funn: 1
 Only yours: 1
 what kind of cheese?: 1
 By the way do you have any receipt for a chesse mushroom pesto or something i can make with chesse and mushrooms?: 1
 hmm, I'm happy you feel good today 😊: 1
 Yeah, I figured that was the case, but I like seeing your face on my home screen 😅❤️: 1
 You're cute, I love seeing you happy and smiling : 1
 Hope you have more energy today 😘: 1
 Figuring it out slowly, just need a lot of practice I guess: 1
 I'm not happy about it, especially because it's so late notice, but clearly it matters to you so yeah: 1
 Dammmmm: 1
 Go to the party: 1
 German are strict we have night time at 22: 1

 And it is only in the thread: 1
 Driving back now: 1
 I miss you too, it's not easy ❤: 1
 Damn, already? That's fast: 1
 Ask someone ?: 1
 You got this hon ❤️ you smart trust me: 1
 Okay hope you can relax a bit tonight then 😘: 1
 Oof, be careful, take breaks and don't forget to take some food for on the way 😘: 1
 Nice hope it really goes away fully 🙏🏻: 1
 Yup kinda make myself horny with that text: 1
 Yesssssssss 🥰🥰🥰🥰: 1
 Yeah, it also hurts less than it did before yesterday so it's kinda nice: 1
 Yup, at 7 tonight: 1
 16: 1
 Good morning love, hope you had a good night. What are you up to today? 😘: 1
 Sadly yeah: 1
 Laying in bed naked?: 1
 i just me i would tell you if something is worng and that allways more then just in subtext: 1
 I don't know, I think maybe I read some subtext that wasn't there so I misinterpreted something that made me worried something was wrong: 1
 Man... You know I would if I could 😭: 1
 What do you mean? I always value your opinion so of course I want to know what you have to say: 1
 Jinte is a side character in so many love storys its insane: 1
 What's your reason why you slept terrible by the way?: 1
 I accidentally kicked him 🥲: 1
 Yes hon you are 😘: 1
 But same goes for you: 1
 Why should i not tell you if something doesnt fit me: 1
 Oh that's so cool that you make them yourself!!: 1
 My gut feeling tells me something is wrong but I don't know if I should trust that or not so I will just assume that you'll tell me if something is wrong: 1
 It's not a set up that you're necessarily gonna walk into and do you know? It's just ideas of things that could happen. And just letting things happen would work for me if I was the one mainly DMing, but that simply doesn't work for Alex because improv isn't exactly their thing. And like I said, it's not always gonna be like this, there's a reason I'm "showing off" now: 1
 How's the drive going? Hopefully a bit smoother than before?: 1
 Neither, I'm in the kitchen 😘: 1
 Also you char is kinda op and makes combat or other rolls stuff kinda to easy or not really useable for the players: 1
 Also excited for the future: 1
 After waking up at 5 already 🥲: 1
 oh okay will look if i fiinds somebody like that hear: 1
 Yeah sure when?: 1
 yeah get that ❤️ no worries: 1
 Ah, sorry, I forgot about that 😅: 1
 Who are you?: 1
 Okay, thanks for clarifying 💜: 1
 My day was fine had the morging free and went to uni atrr 14 until 18 and the back home now playing game with marco: 1
 I'll definitely try: 1
 Whats going on?: 1
 Idk, nothing bad really happened, just feeling shitty I guess. How was your day?: 1
 Now don't ask too much 😂 I won't count what I drink anyway: 1
 Your still driving?: 1
 Then maybe not: 1
 Oh yeah else it would be to easy. You got it hon 😘: 1
 How come? The German player is doing quite good no?: 1
 We can call I guess but I'm really tired so don't expect much energy: 1
 its bull: 1
 Not that okay, idk: 1
 Yeah XD: 1
 Ohhh, I see! Sounds nice but sad indeed: 1
 Ah so next class at 13?: 1
 I'll get over it, no worries: 1
 Your already in class?: 1
 See why I think I might have to come and get you from Brussels? 😅😂: 1
 From there I can probably take a train to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Leipzig: 1
 Yeah, it's like the universe is telling me something about Germany: 1
 ah nice: 1
 How's your day going love? ❤️: 1
 In german its "kohlrabi": 1
 There's also currently a German parking in front of our house... Interesting guy: 1
 Love you in every multiverse ;) ❤️🥰: 1
 I love you so much, thank you for the voice message, currently trying not to cry because you're so sweet and I really can't fucking wait until December. The best motivation I could have is that I need to be able to keep some free time for you, so I will try my hardest to make that possible. I just don't want to fail anyone, especially my parents 🥲 (and you) : 1
 Just eat enough hon i wish i could eat with you and be happily by your side 🥲 love you rabbit 🐇 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 It thino for programming so every body use the same environment: 1
 You let out  moan and your insides are moving bit by bit: 1
 Yeah definitely my is just not that romantic so its a slower death i geuss? 😅: 1
 yeah for sure: 1
 My background picture really doesn't help at all... But I'm not gonna fucking change it. I will just live with the fact that I miss you like hell: 1
 I know hon, but that's the worst case scenario okay? We'll figure something out in between 😘: 1
 Well looks like I need to go out more too 😅. No but I like that you can fall asleep easier 😘: 1
 Sounds like chill evening: 1
 Mabye watch abit more loki: 1
 ? What happened: 1
 Guy said it was -12 until someone else pointed out that it was wrong: 1
 Unfortunately it's a no can do 🥲: 1
 Wish I could see that with my own eyes: 1
 Yeah, chiropractor seems to be helping now, I'm going back in 2 weeks now so yeah, will see: 1
 Guess you'll find out in June if you're right or not 😁: 1
 Nice yeah sounds great sometimes you just have to try some things: 1
 Your university has very interesting events: 1

 Hope you get to sleep fast 😘: 1
 Damn that really sucks... Hope it will be fixed soon 🥲: 1
 Ah shit... Stay strong! 🤞: 1
 The idea of the surgery sounds scary 😅: 1
 Going to uni now. Love you hon 😘: 1
 (you could do it yourself too btw, no doubt about that, but a bit of help is always nice to have): 1
 Oh i don't think you told me then. Hope it goes by fast and you get done with it.: 1
 I don't know if I told you, but I definitely forgot to put it in the calendar. It's just an appointment to check my eyesight and see if I need new glasses: 1
 Miss you too 🥹: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you're still asleep 😘: 1
 Yup, it's bloody great. I now get to send an email to the CEO about it : 1
 Ah well waiting and hope you dont get sick there 🙏🏼. Why are you at the hospital by the way did i forgot something again?: 1
 So now I am an hour too early for my appointment at the hospital 🥲😅: 1
 Hope you all have fun 🥰: 1
 The Belgian commentators keep saying to keep calm, everything is still possible and all that... Sureeee...: 1
 Well I am also feeling that universe wants to give me sign towards Belgium: 1
 If I were religious I would pray for you: 1
 Hope you can take your mind of it abit: 1
 Another one of those classes you can take online and irl?: 1
 Good morning hon, I slept alright but had a pretty weird dream 😅: 1
 We waiting for my aunt right now at here house: 1
 Well i do not knoe but it went still well did talk about the next steps and what we should do and brought our work together so far: 1
 That's so fucking stupif: 1
 Okay, wasn't all that interesting at the student party then?: 1
 Meeting was really fast done nobody really wanted to be there it was great: 1
 Well I believe you wouldn't go alone and I think you would like to go with Celine: 1
 Damn, I think I  can see a silhouette: 1
 Going to the chiropractor, normally I drive there but my parents are using both cars so I can't, which means I'm taking a bus 😊: 1
 By the way i am the online one i my course and its interesting 😅. The others are joining online looks a bit weird: 1
 Ah shit 🥲: 1
 Yeah, they're pretty flexible with it, pretty sure they would allow it as long as I don't have any meetings scheduled: 1
 It looks like they wanna move it i love and hate the group its a roller-coaster.: 1
 My body is also sore because of dance and chiropractor yesterday, it's really fun: 1
 Not gonna go to the party 🥳: 1
 It feels like it was a bad decision: 1
 I know no worries: 1
 Everyone has the right to their own opinion: 1
 Well i think klaas is a nice name: 1
 Sincerely disagree, that's the most Netherlands Dutch name ever and just no... You'd get bullied for that in Belgium: 1
 Oh okay, makes even less sense then but sure why not?: 1
 Sorry first aid: 1
 Calling my cousin now... I was going to go to sleep early today 😅: 1
 Yeah 😅 but your mom would love too: 1
 Sucks but oh well relaxing abit then. How was the chiropractor by the way did help now?: 1
 The fucking traffic was crazy 😅: 1
 I'm annoyed but I still love you and I will be actually angry if you don't call me later.: 1
 Home alone, my parents are both gone out to A) watch a basketball game and B) go to a restaurant: 1
 Okay 🥲 why any reason?: 1
 Thanks was really nice. They help me alot with the game and cards: 1
 At least you were productive before 15! And family time is always important! Had a pretty good day, just still have a couple of things I should technically do today, but I can still do them tomorrow just fine... Procrastination at it's best 😅😁: 1
 Going to dance tonight? <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Damm thats sounds really nice: 1
 How are you doing hon?: 1
 15 if I can make it but I am not sure. Will tell you tomorrow: 1
 Same to you melady: 1
 Aw, cutie: 1
 So its mostly what you taught i wanted to say. The course is as always online but i was there in person. The others this time didn't show up in person. The picture showes somebody useing the pc from home like a ghost kinda funny: 1
 Just got home, dance was nice. How's your evening going?: 1
 Ups i fuck up the text sorry. will tell you later about it.: 1
 So my mom went along with it joking "oh, I didn't know you were going on dates": 1
 I have no clue what this means, you had an online class but you went to school anyway?: 1
 Any news from your Alex?: 1
 Well it will probably turn to rain again as in a few hours: 1
 Done with the concert now chilling with alex and Patrick at Patrick place eating forzen pizza☺️: 1
 The Fronch: 1
 Yeah, but I gotta do the work too at some point 😅: 1
 Fair enough, when you put it that way 😂: 1
 Oh well its the weekend better relax so you can start with energy into the week: 1
 But Friday's we stop at 5 anyway, so I'll be home early 🥳: 1
 Studying didn't go too well, at a bar with my family now 😅: 1
 Yes on our way to the concert. How did studying for your course go today?: 1
 Well damn okay... We'll have to buy one then 🫣: 1
 Good idea will do: 1
 That's fair!: 1

 Hehe i love that ❤️🤭: 1
 Yeah i meam there are always good songs: 1
 Cute nerd ❤️: 1
 Love you rabbit 🐇 and miss you a lot your soooooooo cute ❤️: 1
 The renovations themselves are great, really cool how they innovate everything, but the people doing it are really cringeworthy in a bad way: 1
 You start shaking again with your legs: 1
 Nothing much planned. Uni call my parents some house chores: 1
 I sincerely have no clue how you have managed to fuck your sleep schedule up like this: 1
 My dream yesterday was a lot more fun 😅 you kissed me in that one, was much nicer 😊: 1
 Yes! Thank you!! 😘: 1
 But it's just because the DC gets chaotic sometimes and there's less people in the Instagram...: 1
 yeah but could we start a bit later like 20: 1
 That's like real nightmare shit crazy 😳. Hope you feel okay now: 1
 Goodnight my silly goose, sweet dreams ❤️😘: 1
 Had a hard time falling back asleep after that because I really felt like I was choking, it was creepy as fuck: 1
 Damm wtf: 1
 I was stuck in a tunnel under ground after being chased by my Australian cousins and I basically choked to death 🥲: 1
 ah sweetie Hope you have a good night to ❤️: 1
 Well when you just say pasta it kinda sounds like it ya know?: 1
 And 2 gingerbeers for the same price 😭😭😭: 1
 Good morning my love hope you slept well too ❤️: 1
 I am way to tired right now 😴 going to sleep in seconds so goodnight <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 No love you back though?: 1
 Of course not hon, you could never ❤️: 1
 Hope i didn't interrupt your calling time sorry 🥹: 1
 Oh, I see! Without supervision is just a work class then? You make some assignments or how does it work? : 1
 Calling Alex 😅: 1
 Its abit much and sometimes its better to sleep a night over text like this. But i also totally get the text. It's just some much of a wall of text for some you actually need to have a conversation about.: 1
 Yeah, we're probably gonna talk some more online and maybe meet up sometimes: 1
 Great light but a shitty night woke up like every 3 hours but was okay over all. Also stayed in bed abit long so i need to rush now😅: 1
 Hope I meet you in my dreams again 😘: 1
 I mean I do wonder the same about your pictures: 1
 So you made it to your second trai: 1
 Alright back from class and will study now: 1
 How are you spending your evening?: 1
 Okay still making food like 10 min: 1
 How was the day with the French?: 1
 I can call whenever you want: 1
 Okay, cool, very much doubt we do that in Belgium 😅: 1
 That was a question btw: 1
 Yeah, gonna try to sleep too but I don't feel tired at all 😅: 1
 It already happening but  we gone go later.: 1
 Ah nice got to know her better: 1
 Oooh, cool, you have a celebration for that? That's nice!: 1
 Stepedium? What's that?: 1
 Yeah not that much i also thought so 😅: 1
 Yeah i love too but at some points during the day i don't wanna distract you and in the evening i glad  can do. Also hope you believe me on that one but sometimes i think about it bit you already send one at that time <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Yeah also it gets broadcast on twitch: 1
 Apparently there's a lot of really nice graffiti in Porto: 1
 We have a shit ton of events too but nothing like a gaming tournament or things like that, most of it is just readings or debates, and of course parties: 1
 Well, okayish is better than bad I guess? And yeah, cheap food always better: 1
 Yeah dont know it either but if yoz wanna rent about it more feel free i will listen. And probably agree: 1
 Did you went to the dnd movie? And how was it if you went?: 1
 They were all trying to convince me of that, and I said that I understand where they're coming from but throwing a friendship of 3 years away isn't exactly a thing you do on a whimsy so it's not an easy thing to expect someone to just do so. Mae's bf called me stupid, dumb and ignorant. I asked him to stop because I was kind of done with it and didn't want to talk about it anymore. He doubled down and once again said I'm ignorant. I again asked him to stop. He once again did not 😅.: 1
 Sad, at least you get to chill at home: 1
 You do that. You deserve a good night ❤️: 1
 Yup... trying to translate media richness was a pain: 1
 Hey love, my night was alright, got a bit of a headache today though so I'm avoiding looking at my phone too much: 1
 The annoying part of it was just that I had to translate really specific words they used into dutch and without knowing exactly what they mean it was fucking impossible to do so correctly 🥲: 1
 Yeah i am also gonna sleep now. Just a bit tired over the howl day: 1
 And we going to Ikea now 😄: 1
 Oh ups nevermind but i feel that still: 1
 But your still getting it done and not procrastination i am proud hon: 1
 Same thing goes the other was around: 1
 Thanks, hon yeah I thought so: 1
 Still think it's fucking stupid that I have to write this goddamn text in Dutch though: 1
 Sounds like the definition of what a over thinking person would say. But yeah is a bit scary: 1
 Still working on the assignment but I'm almost done, think half an hour more and that's it: 1
 Working on an assignment I hate, so my day is... bearable. How's your day?µ: 1
 I fucking hate Word so much: 1
 Relaxing working on the website and babysitting my neffew.: 1
 Enjoy it, I'll just sit through this boring class while yawning the whole time 🥲: 1
 I hate having my picture taken 😅... The guy literally just arrived and I already feel stressed when I don't even have to pose or anything 😭: 1
 Damn niceee: 1
 Hope your meeting is long since over: 1
 I got time no worrys: 1
 Which comparing it to any other people at the table really wasn't that much: 1
 And by when does it need to be finished?: 1
 will tell you ❤️: 1
 Oh nice send me some pictures of the kitchen later. Hope you get through the day hon belive in you ❤️: 1
 Maybe, will see, they're installing the kitchen so it won't be peaceful at home: 1
 Feel still abit tired over all: 1
 yeah we fine still working: 1
 Oh nice how was jinte and did she like the present?: 1
 Was also surprisingly short, but very nice 😊: 1
 Oh, that's pretty good!: 1
 More nauseous really: 1
 Sorry wrote it shitty: 1
 So you have to work on the project until 17: 1
 I'm home, parking wasn't as bad as I expected 😊: 1
 I also have a really busy day tomorrow and I'm not sure I will be able to handle it but I will try: 1
 Gone be late but thanks: 1
 I was worried for nothing: 1
 I adjusted my phone wallpaper a little bit: 1
 Oh, nice, enjoy the food! 😘: 1
 Let me know when you go to sleep? I want to know how badly you fuck up your sleeping schedule again 😂😘: 1
 Better than I expected honestly, was afraid it would take hours: 1
 I'm too fucking emotional and over thinking right now: 1
 Didnt watch it at all yet: 1
 I'm probably sick 😅 and I feel nauseous so it's not a great idea to go to a restaurant and eat a lot of Italian food 😅: 1
 We're in 1848 now though: 1
 Nevermind, not having dinner with my family, no food for me thank you very much: 1
 How are you doing my love 😘: 1
 Nah, not really, but interesting how high pitched some people's voice is: 1
 I feel like I've wished you luck with the interview like 20 times already, but still, good luck! 😁: 1
 Aw shit... That sucks 🥲 hope it goes away soon 🍀: 1
 I think so too but I don't remember when or where: 1
 Should have assumed so: 1
 Okay, I'll be counting down the minutes until I get to go home 😅: 1
 Your plan for tonight me lady ?: 1
 How far away is the hospital?: 1
 Anyone else sending this I would think they expect more of an answer then they got before and that's what they're asking for in a roundabout way, that's why I think I was overreading it 😅: 1
 There's a new season out?: 1
 Watching Loki probably just relaxing and doing some exercise for my courses: 1
 Doubt it, this guy only sells privately, not publically, but thanks for the suggestion 😘: 1
 Will do 😅: 1
 Nah, there's a bunch of them and we don't have a good relationship with them at all + they only speak Bulgarian, so yeah: 1
 Just ask them go over mabye help ?: 1
 Will text you later: 1
 My day was allright didnt do much. Meet up with alex and Patrick for the business over discord and some other stuff. How was math?: 1
 Alright, just got out of math class and gonna cycle home now. How's your day hon? 😘: 1
 I said not a thing I'm naturally very good at... The sarcasm wasn't needed 🥲: 1
 Okay, anyway I'm gonna go to sleep. Enjoy the rest of your night my love ❤️: 1
 You've been to these kinds of parties a lot before? <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1

 Yeah quit nice its alot louder then i remember but been a while: 1
 Driving home now, hope you're having a good time 😘: 1
 You want some gossip to do with Jinte? It's nothing much but kinda funny: 1
 First we were there foe 3 hours and it was nice over all. Also you were right it was a traffic light party and i grabbed yellow red and green. Green for Alex because he ask for yellow and yellow and red for me because at first I was red but then i went to grab yellow to because "i didn't eant to scare the of Alex".

 That's more interesting: 1
 It's not that I want to fight about it or that I want to talk about it more for no reason because quite frankly it happened and that's just the situation now, but it made me come to an important realisation I want to talk to you about.: 1
 I didn't mean I want to talk about any news in person: 1
 When you told me about the news you wanted to talk in person I was not thinking about him. I was thinking about a dead person though: 1
 Yeahhh, he's a bit of an ass indeed. Mae talked to him about it afterwards though and she says he understands what he did wrong but still, it's a shitty thing to do: 1
 The news you wanted to talk about: 1
 It's fineeee: 1
 Yeah get that i was not thiinking about him though: 1
 And what's up with all the sudden business things?: 1
 Also about the talking later, it's mainly just because I don't want to talk about this over text, if anything it should be at least over a video call: 1
 Not too sure how I feel yet today, only just woke up. How are you feeling?: 1
 Okay, will do that in person. When or just the next time we talk: 1

 Okay have fun in law classes and concentrate on it 😘: 1
 We're waiting for the help locomotive: 1
 Will listen to it later: 1
 Huh what was that text about ?: 1
 Okay so basically when you have a womb, every month before the menstruation, the wall of the womb thickens. This is a specific kind of tissue that then breaks off again after ovulation and causes the bleeding to happen, as well as cramps and all that. With endometriosis, this tissue isn't only inside of the womb, but can also grow on the outside or on other parts. The issue with this is that every month when menstruation happens, this tissue also breaks off and bleeds, without a straight away escape like it usually does. This causes a shit ton of pain and usually heavier bleeding and cramps. Very often it is overlooked for years because the general conception of menstrual pain is that it is painful, so usually both women, the people around them and doctors assume it is normal. However, women with endometriosis usually are in so much pain they can not get through the day without painkillers, and sometimes have such debilitating pain that they can not walk or basically do anything. It's also a lot harder to get pregnant: 1
 Good luck to you too then: 1
 I swear to god every single time I do an update on that laptop something goes wrong: 1
 Yeah, using a mouse now, my dad will call a guy tomorrow to see if they can do anything about it: 1

 Eh... Not motivation to do anything honestly, especially since there's no time limit on the task I'm supposed to do. Very nice to have Mousti with me though: 1
 But it's interesting: 1
 You really shouldn't feel shitty about it, there's nothing you can do about it or anything like that, it's just not so nice of a situation in general: 1

 Hah... Yeah, nah 😅: 1
 Also food makes me feel a lot better about it: 1
 I have a bunch of things to tell you at some point: 1

 Just scrolling through Instagram, I'll probably read my book, learn some German or something later. How's class going?: 1
 Just got back from skiing and then a nice dinner at a hotel near the mountains: 1
 So much police in general? There was also a police officer on my train with a gun, there's a lot more security than I'm used to: 1
 Will you be the 8 to my m8?: 1
 Still sucks, but it's kinda alright then I guess? How much overtime do you think he's gonna go?: 1
 And mf.... I have to say, it's hot: 1
 Did you get a picture of your dad in the Depeche mode shirt?: 1
 Anything planned other than class and dnd?: 1

 Yeah but I don't want to have to be the person keeping the conversation up and running the whole time: 1
 Yeah i feel good working on it and it kinda distracts me: 1
 Man, this train is just stuck in the middle of nowhere in Belgium: 1
 Alex's only message she had when she woke up was from a guy she knew last year that basically called her a bitch so that's why 😅: 1

 Just impressed or horrified some people by telling them about my smuggling history: 1
 If you can't figure it out it either it's fine, I'm just massively confused about it but honestly it's just a small tidbit I'd like to know, not crucial to the work I'm supposed to be doing at all 😅: 1
 Yuppp, it's absolutely lovely: 1
 Apparently we do need a sticker: 1
 I don't think I did: 1
 40 days 😅😢: 1
 I don't think you realise how scared I am that I'm not good for you. Not as in that you would think I'm not good enough for you, but more like me being in your life somehow isn't good or healthy for you. All I want is for you to be happy and healthy, and preferably I'd want to be there for that: 1
 Apparently so... Goddamn it: 1
 Wish you could but db and the universe has something against that: 1
 Yeah will do. How is hanging out with Alex?: 1
 Yeah, I gotta say, you definitely do get to experience every single kind of misery they can put you through 😭😂: 1
 How's uni going for you?: 1

 I am definitely missing that: 1
 I had 12 minutes to get my train: 1
 Sorry just woke up 😅: 1

 Makes me appreciate the fact that I can actually speak that a lot more: 1
 Man, you see where my mind is at?': 1
 I'll eat some grapes too so it's not entirely unhealthy 😅: 1
 I'm also getting my money back, Jesus. DB better pay up 💪: 1
 I would have a shit ton of questions though, but mainly about the way that works and how awkward it was: 1
 Trying too: 1
 Making myself horny too: 1
 Nice yeah I have no idea what's inside the agreement. I just Klick accept most of the time. I know what cookies do but that's all: 1
 I'm still waiting to book a reserved seat for the one from Frankfurt on though, no clue how or when or what will happen, not risking it: 1
 Nice good job not standing long times in a train for you today: 1
 😅😅: 1
 That AND/OR if god is willing, perhaps even you telling me how and what you've been doing the last couple of days: 1
 Except going to bed early: 1

 Queen for the people: 1
 Nothing 🥲: 1
 How are your neighbors on the train: 1
 I hope and pray that you get here some what in a good time for the circumstances.: 1

 Yeah, I think so too, would be better in person but that's still a while 🥲: 1

 Oh darling... there is NOTHING downstairs anymore, not even the couch. I think only the tv is still on the wall and that's it 😂: 1
 Okay let me rephrase that: 1
 Wish her well for me?: 1
 Love you Loads back: 1
 I mean, they have a chocolate vault and organ, that good enough?: 1
 I booked a reserved seat on the train to Frankfurt: 1
 Oh it's a honey Waffel: 1

 Guess so 😅: 1
 You look cute: 1
 Yeah, quite a lot, a whole garbage bag: 1
 Idk, maybe yeah: 1
 Sucks but crazy how oftem that happens. Was it alot to throw away?: 1
 Apparently it's not that spontaneous, it's been planned for a while but I once again didn't know about it until today 😅: 1
 Hope it's not that many folders: 1
 Tonight we're having dinner with family and the resident Greek guy who apparently is getting my dad a giant fire bowl he can use to cook today 😅: 1
 At the store to buy drinks now: 1
 My mom also thinks there's not enough salt 😭: 1
 How is your day going hon? What are you up too?: 1
 No rush on anything, let's just enjoy ourselves as much as we can: 1
 On another note, probably not gonna study in Antwerp after all. I found a study program in Gent that allows me to get a master's in 2 years instead of 4 like in Antwerp 😊: 1
 We were slaughtered... How sad. 6-0 😭: 1
 Can't be the 26th soon enough: 1
 It's good food, my grandpa prepared it: 1
 I miss you loads: 1
 cranberry: 1
 And I really don't want to take that out on you, but you're not helping me: 1

 Wanna call in 20 mins ?: 1
 How is the party(strip dance think I don't kown the name) with your mom: 1
 Spagetti with pesto and some veggi meat balls: 1
 Eating my food and watching some youtube: 1
 Any progress on the Rubix cube?: 1
 the one that died 1 year ago i think: 1
 Nevermind found you: 1
 Queen elisabeth: 1
 Okay will do but I think I am going to bed now 😘: 1
 Which queen?: 1
 the King died: 1
 Yeah it is, but when you don't know that it's well... Weird: 1
 Tsss, that's not good 🙃: 1
 Nope didn't touch it much: 1
 if you bake mushrooms and garlic until most of their moisture is gone (best with a very small amount of oil), let them cool and then add spices and olive oil + grated parmesan you can then blend those and it's kind of like a pesto, but much less spicy I guess? Just don't over blend it, it's quite nice if there's still some small pieces. It's quite good on toast: 1
 Yeah sure hon any time you want to 🥰: 1
 Well yeah, what is it in German then?: 1
 The "based on real events" does confuse a lot of people: 1
 Don't laugh at me: 1
 Cant remember what she calls them. Hoped you can help me 😅: 1

 Would love to see a power point of this 🙏🏼🤭: 1
 I'm pretty sure Aeneas would be understanding enough if we told him we feel that way? 😅 But I'm glad we're on the same page 😘: 1
 Not as if I'm not wishing you were here instead of the hoodie hon, I'd give anything for you 2 to switch places: 1

 I'm fine with cold outside, but the uni campus apparently doesn't do heating and I had to sit still for 3 hours so my feet are frozen: 1
 Nah, we went on a trip (us and Aeneas) and then I had to leave because I had my internship in the morning, but I then it turned out you guys got on your planes, but somehow I missed mine. And then I was stuck there, but my boss of my internship is there as well and I was trying to book a new ticket to get home the next day but he told me it would take at least 2 months before I got to go home because buying plane tickets on the island is really difficult.: 1
 Looks nice top 4 % is crazy: 1
 What do you mean with work flow? Like organisational wise within a company or individual?: 1
 Ah yeah if you wanna have snow there is no other way than it being cold. Is the heating working again?: 1

 Well without you 🥲: 1
 We will see what happens indeed: 1
 So what are you up to then?: 1
 Nope, but it's okay, I'll get it done tomorrow: 1
 That is partially a myth but it's mostly because we're more used to it so our pain levels to showing pain are higher: 1
 Or, well, another option is that they just want to see what the market could be for the new product: 1
 Nah went on dc to talk with alex and fabian abit: 1
 In our underground storage: 1
 I hope you realise that my curiosity is never about anything big specifically, just about things that people tell me about exist but don't tell me anything else about: 1
 Also there are same plan changes. We will go to my parents house on Saturday and meet my grandparents too: 1
 I will keep you to that because you've just awakened massive curiosity in me: 1

 Well he can try it out and see if he likes it? Kinda hard to tell if he hasn't done it before. And if he does it for the people alone... Well, idk, will have to see how Alex and Jinte react to him then?: 1
 The size of the thing I don't know doesn't matter whatsoever: 1
 Aw, no... How come you have a headache? You slept enough? Drink enough? Looked at your screen too much? Maybe taking a walk outside can help?: 1
 Like Jinte not telling me what he costume was gonna be or things like that: 1

 Mabye asking for a picture 😘: 1
 Yeah no, it's really funny. he asked a guy about the legal driving limit (he didn't know) and then how much is in a 2 meters of beer (he also didn't know and said I couldn't drink that) so the prof then said that I definitely know how to drink well 😂: 1

 My class this afternoon is cancelled: 1
 Had a heart attack today: 1
 About the dinner invitation sure sounds fun. The hour was well spent on helping your cousin. Hope she does go against it with the guy but you know everybody makes mistakes at some point in there life: 1
 Nice, good luck with that!: 1

 Sounds weird as fuck and a bit awkward but still nice that you talk with them. Your parents know by the way that you called them? And any plans to fly down 😅?: 1
 Just felt weird, didn't talk to them in a year or something. They didn't change that much, I still know how they act and all that, but yeah, it's weird how they act like nothing is wrong. They also said they might want to come to Europe and asked when I will go to Australia to visit them and all that 😅: 1
 Class of course, apparently I'm calling my cousins during my lunch break and I will have to finish my background story for DnD at some point too: 1

 Nothing much prepare for dnd. Do some university stuff thats it mostly: 1
 I'm gonna stay home then, I really don't like walking through the park so late at night 😅 (I don't want you to walk through it either but yeah): 1

 Fair enough, in the end it's your decision, you're the DM, if you think it's too difficult or you're not sure about it to add him in for next session then that's just that.: 1
 Would never think about that 😅: 1
 Kaze Tachinu: 1
 Ich habe gerade ein Übersetzertool auf meinem Telefon gefunden, das direkt übersetzt, wenn ich tippe ... Können Sie mir bitte sagen, wie genau das ist? Ich möchte mit einigen Leuten ficken : 1

 Found a good reason: 1
 I need a really good reason not to skip my next class and instead go back home and sleep: 1
 I can pass off random people touching me in a big crowd because it happens and I'd rather not think of it any wrong way, but that guy got too close and kinda ruined my mood: 1
 Still needing to make dinner probably making just pasta&pesto tonight and nothing really planted except doing some work on website and Phase games stuff: 1
 Pftt: 1

 I'm drinking your Arizona right now 😁: 1
 There's a lot more red lights 3 streets from that 😂: 1

 And considering 10 years ago in the same place instead of the lights there was ham... A lot better than back then for sure: 1
 My chest and probably face but that's not too bad. You're still gonna work today or gonna hang out with Alex and Killian?: 1
 But I'm happy I went for Cato and their family: 1

 "waiting for connecting travelers": 1

 Jealousy, pure jealousy, it's raining here 😭: 1
 I found something I can't figure out. I don't know what the fuck this thing means or what the hell it does. Please help me?: 1
 Oh, that's pretty cool too!: 1
 And I think they might have a holiday now but not sure: 1
 I... I said that: 1
 Of course, just wanted to make sure 😊: 1
 I'm back home now: 1
 Maybe that's a bit of a very broad description, basically the woman is asexual (though this is never said explicitly throughout the book) so when the moment arrives she is absolutely disgusted and runs away, the man on the other hand has been looking forward to this moment their whole relationship and is absolutely horrified by what happens. This is then explained from both sides and just the psychological idea behind the book is really interesting, especially because it is set in the 80s, idk, I just found it really nice: 1
 Just the funeral: 1
 Yeah the one in Germany ask and works with the "old colonies": 1
 Yeah, it's 12: 1
 Enjoy the family time! 😘: 1
 Just there to dance: 1
 What's your favourite flavour of ice cream again?: 1
 Goodnight I guess, hopefully ❤️: 1
 My mom also wanted me to emphasize once more that this is all my dad's idea, my mom and I couldn't care less where we go to eat 😅 (and she feels slightly bad for putting the pressure of going there on you): 1
 Hey its still the same fucking language 😅: 1
 Own company would be nice but not necessarily and else probably working as a web- or gameprogrammer for some company <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Schlaf', Kindlein, schlaf'! Am Himmel zieh'n die Schaf: 1
 Yeah probably 😅: 1
 Okay mabye if you wanna call?: 1
 But I appreciate the offer: 1

 I really really want to sleep: 1
 Better than you ever, looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid: 1
 Pretty good need to go to uni soon. I also need to find some food on my way. Didnt eat much today 😅. By the way i am changing my Operating system of my laptop to linux because i am done with windows. So that a big task taking my next 2/3 days will see.: 1
 Idk, not tonight: 1
 I know it's late if you dont wanna call <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 So far so good, just a nice lady and a guy but they're both sleeping, it's pretty chill: 1
 I love you and i hope that your opinion doesn't change because if you tell me to come over i will be there. I hate it that my voice of reason also keeps me here. But i will wait and do my thinks here first 😮‍💨: 1
 Cutie 🫠🥰 and same back to you: 1
 Maybe tease you 🤭: 1
 I can only say i love you too this and same in every way. Really great full for everything from meeting you to comeing together from just being beside you: 1
 And while I do feel more connected already, I'd like to fully reconnect in whatever way that's possible and try to make it so neither of us experiences this feeling in the future. Distance sucks but we'll be okay in spite of it 💜: 1
 Nearby?: 1
 Probably the second 😅: 1
 yup had a good night of sleep: 1
 My grandpa might have some pictures, idk, but yeah, I can imagine small Niki playing in the snow too, really fucking adorable 🥰: 1
 It looks really nice driving around. Still love as i were a child: 1
 Fair enough, just do whatever you feel best with 😘: 1
 Sounds tiring but pretty interesting! Would take time management, meeting people and driving around over boring classes most days 😅: 1
 Doing the same so: 1
 Hope it goes away soon 😮‍💨: 1
 Nice doing the same now with some games and a cold Spezi. My day was alot of time management driving and meeting with people. Was nice not gone lie but alot of social interaction 😅.: 1

 Good morning my love ❤️. How was your sleep ?: 1
 Sure yeah: 1
 Btw, do you maybe want to watch a movie tonight? I feel like there's too many movies on our list: 1
 Bussnis stuff with alex and Patrick: 1
 Mostly because i am only programming on it so way shouldnt I it makes sense. And the starting Problem was because of a docker update with windows subsystem ... and some more stuff. Hope you can relax at home and mabye use some heating on your stomach or back to help with the period a bit. Love you rabbit 😘🐇: 1
 How is your night?: 1

 Well... Idk?? It has to get done at some point? But I do agree that this isn't the way to do it: 1
 What's the point in trying to act like a brat when your response just makes me melt anyway: 1
 Can't wait for that either 😘: 1
 It made sense, we were talking about kids in the future and some of us saying we didn't feel the need for them but would do it for our partner, she said that both of them would like kids and that he'd be a good dad: 1
 But just to point out, I'm an adult too and I can make my own decisions 🙃: 1
 The French are everywhere: 1
 Being a adult now and tell you to go sleep now please 🥺: 1
 Sorry, had to do that: 1

 Don't worry about it 😘: 1
 Miss you like crszy but my weeks are also pact with stuff to do and meetings and family time its crazy: 1

 The only thing that would make this image better would be if it included us cuddling: 1

 Just wanna paint you a picture. Its abit windy and rainy outside but also really quit. You can nearly only hear then wind and some raining outside. The windows is open and its nicely fresh outside. The leafs are still out side but also falling every where. You can hear some cars driving by but you also get more tired every time you can here one until you fall asleep: 1
 Talking to you is comforting: 1
 Didn't expect that, but thanks 😘: 1
 Goodnight rabbit ❤️ 😘🐇: 1
 We can watch it together if u want to love to see it again. I really dislike watch movies again because I remember everything the first 5 min but not with this one I don't know: 1
 Definitely true, would have never expected that: 1
 Its crazy how some knowledge is useable some times: 1
 Have to wait here for another 25 minutes before the train to Aachen: 1
 Story behind that please 🥺: 1
 That's something? I mean, could be worse? 😅: 1
 Yeah the alex wont come you told me already: 1
 It went quite well I think? Guess I'll find out next week when we get the grade. How's your studying going, other than very exhausting?: 1
 I hope I wasn't being too annoying 😅: 1
 Idk, I just think they're both not really putting effort in, Alex told me they keep just having the same conversations about how their day went, but really boringly? Idk how to describe it. Probably could be fixed if they called though I guess: 1
 Oh damm really why happened? Just inaktiv?: 1
 I should do some university stuff now: 1
 Okay not the most save option but well if she gets off: 1
 Good kitten: 1
 Nice what did you dream about?: 1

 Don't know what you're saying sorry about: 1
 If I wasn't so tired I would: 1
 Yuppp, there's 1 guy I want to give bad grades to because well... his text isn't good and he's quite fucking annoying to work with, but I also don't want him to lash out on me because of it... Especially because we still have half of the project to go : 1
 That's sad, I would have loved to see you try to participate in DnD drunk 😂: 1
 You wanna fight?: 1
 He really is: 1
 Yeah, not gonna lie it really sucks 😅: 1
 Goodnight my love: 1
 Why are you calling me clumsy now??: 1
 Stop being so cute: 1
 He is fucking adorable sometimes: 1
 You wanna say anything other than Goodnight my love: 1
 Hope he gets use to it i mean it was kinda his dream to work at a military company: 1
 Even though the thought of you laying awake pains me, it's quite nice waking up to a message of you telling me you love me 😘 instantly brightens my day 😊: 1
 Thank god for that: 1
 Yeah I figured something had your attention 😅: 1
 Goodnight my clumsy but also very lovely little rabbit 😘🐇: 1

 The late night meet ups in my dorm, playing pool at the Club, playing cardgames, deciding on movies, having people cook and cooking for people in my dorm, the snow, getting to know you without realising entirely how deep I would fall eventually. The trip we took, just sitting next to each other listening and silently singing along to the music. Me trying to look at you without being too obvious so I could add all the songs you would sing along to to the playlist I was making. Just so I could later on listen to it and think about you (well that was my plan before we actually got together), so many memories I'm so so thankful for: 1
 Okay i see well in that case i would mabye over think believing in you: 1
 Sounds lovely: 1

 To finally seeing you beautiful upper body: 1
 Claiming my territory: 1
 It starts in 45 minutes: 1
 My hand slowly moving over your body stopping at the right points to have some fun until you feel teased: 1
 Kissing everywhere, leaving a lot of bite marks: 1
 Nope no once: 1
 But not a lot: 1
 And you wait it out or what?: 1
 Ah shit... Hope he doesn't feel too bad about it, good luck staying awake, don't fall asleep in your clothes again 😘: 1
 Little touches to where i really want you: 1
 Why would you bring this up 😭: 1
 No it okay just tell me more: 1
 he is cute and he knows it: 1
 I'm sorry master: 1
 Can't hold it my little bitch: 1
 100 % me: 1
 My legs are shaking like crazy: 1
 Its sooo bad right now i can't: 1
 Sounds perfect I will help you where ever I can.: 1
 Yeah its not exactly the first think i am wanna see when i come over either. Like your bedroom a bit more 😘: 1
 Can't stop thinking about cuddling you 🥲❤️: 1
 Great minds think alike ;): 1
 Man 2 lovers 1 thought: 1
 I really want to fall asleep in your arms, or the opposite idc, just... with you here: 1
 Man now i wanna cuddle badly 🥲: 1
 Also really miss you and can't wait to hug you: 1
 Or mabye watch a movie on Netflix or something like that ☺️: 1
 Hmm, acceptable: 1
 Yeah and cuddling is too😘 mabye we can combine the two 🤭: 1
 Wish to be there 🥲: 1
 Okayyy, I see what your priorities are, but you're right, sleep is important: 1
 My grandfather is taking about politics again with my uncle its kinda funny how they get so into the topic in like 10 min. How is your cleaning going?: 1
 How'd your sister get you on the guestlist anyway?: 1
 Yes definitely 😅: 1
 Having a kitchen will be nice, but it's not exactly the main thing I'm looking forward to: 1
 I think we both just need to accept that we're not on at our best in text conversations hon, nothing much we can do about it I'm afraid, except practice perhaps? Idk: 1
 Then I am gone make somethink too eat now: 1
 Quite frankly: 1
 Is it comfortable? The dress looks pretty comfortable: 1
 Why are you so mean: 1
 Still think it would be better if I actually had salt, but I guess Wednesday that problem should be kinda solved: 1
 Yeah it was way to late. Sad that she didn't win you know what her song was called? What are your plans for today?: 1
 You flirting with me still makes my heart beat faster and I hope that feeling never leaves, so I can feel like I'm falling in love with you again and even deeper every single day: 1
 Would 100% get on top of you if I could 😘: 1
 Cutie but that howl think makes me so horny again 🥲: 1
 Good intuition then 😘: 1
 I hope I dream something similar tonight too 🤭: 1
 Can i call you?: 1
 Goddamn, didn't expect that: 1
 You think I pay attention to your spelling mistakes when you write something like this?? 😳🥵: 1
 But classes are over for today: 1
 I could do the same... But god knows I do not want my mom to nag at me because of it 😅: 1
 Yeah hope i dream tonight again 🤭😳: 1
 Good idea ☺️: 1
 My law class is very interesting right now, I'll tell you about it later 😂: 1
 Lucky you, ended up giving most of them an okay grade after all, and Celine and outstanding one of course 😅: 1
 Yeah no worries hon i get what you feeling have a similar person in my group but thankfully I don't need to grade them: 1
 For the record though, I don't want to give him fail grades, just not great ones: 1
 Nothing much mostly uni stuff: 1
 Hope we meet in our dreams hon 🥰: 1
 It's basically just giving your teammates feedback, but obligatory and they know who gave them what grades, which sucks: 1
 Also my mom wemt with us kinda weird  feels like a family trip: 1
 I would say you can do me but oh well, distance and all that crap: 1
 Just some university stuff: 1
 Oh hon, I wish I could be with you. Man, if I was only 30 or something minutes away I'd fucking get in the car right now : 1
 My room is almost in order 😄: 1
 Ah, pretty sure my mom would make a similar joke: 1
 There are kinda funny to be honest: 1
 It's only for electronic/digital ideas?: 1
 My day was okay, nothing special. Later... Eh, we'll see: 1
 I didn't realized that yet but yeah: 1
 I mean I should probably study more but I also really miss you so yeah sounds nice, just not too long I guess: 1
 Finally home 🥲: 1
 okay will trry: 1
 Very rude: 1
 Gone make food and call you around 30 okay?: 1
 Really happy I'll be there in 2 days: 1
 Okay hon love you 🥰.  Please don't think too much about it and I also realized that you can be sorry about so I was also at fault. Will improve together 😘: 1
 Which message?: 1
 You sure? I don't mind not calling for a week or something so you have more time, or just only sending a text in the morning and evening: 1
 Miss you and love you ❤️: 1
 I am happy for you: 1
 Hope i dream about you 🙏🏼: 1
 nothing to say thanks for 😘 love you hon ❤️,: 1
 Okay hope it still okayish to relax a bit: 1
 By the way Alex and Me talk about Doggystyle and the lack of intimacy. That we both miss. To be honest was a interestiinng topic out of the blue: 1
 Yeah, no, the problem is that every time I'm stuck in the island, somehow you got off it already 😅: 1
 All alone with alot of free time😘🥵: 1
 I know and I love it: 1
 This time we went out for dinner, my boss wasn't there but I think you were (I don't fully remember) and I missed my plane because I was too late at the gate but then I wasn't and it just turned out there was no plane to Brussels... Idk, had to wait until the next morning (Monday) to get another plane to go home: 1
 You're still studying tonight or relaxing a bit too?: 1
 Reading the presentation and relaxing mostly: 1
 Hmm, don't push yourself too hard. I'm sure you already know exactly what to say: 1
 Idk, does that make sense?: 1
 Uni stuff so i don't need to do it tonight: 1
 Boy, it's chocolate, I know you don't like chocolate 😅: 1
 Oh right, I completely forgot today is the German national holiday... congratulations? 😂: 1
 What's something you're watching at the moment or you're gonna have to decide still?: 1
 Have fun finding something then 😘: 1
 Goodnight my love, I hope you have a relaxing evening/night ❤️: 1
 Good morning Hon my night was okayish just woke up around 5 for some reason. After 13: 1
 Was really nice we need to do one: 1
 Goodnight my love hope you dream of me 🥰😋: 1
 You went to sleep early last night? Maybe that's why you woke up so early? Stress never helps too. : 1
 (I'm like 80% sure you're already asleep 😂): 1
 Gone sleeping like instantly I don't know how: 1
 Nice! You better celebrate that then 😘: 1
 Yeah... It kinda ends on a cliffhanger but it's not a bad one, just an open ending I guess? Third season should be out next year so we're just waiting for that I guess 😅: 1
 16C° and cloudy: 1
 Hope the exam is equally chill then: 1
 I would love for it to snow when you're here: 1
 I didn't think it would be this bad honestly, but idk, I miss you more than ever: 1
 Yeah sure hon, always up for texting with you: 1
 Whenever you want: 1
 Okay gone eat and then call you: 1
 Nice and It look really good even if I am not a big fan of fish: 1
 No rush, enjoy your meal 😘: 1
 Why the fuck are you awake: 1
 Morning (afternoon) love, my night was okay, only slept through my alarm apparently 😅: 1
 But once again: 1
 Hahahha, not that old: 1
 More than I realised and in weirder spots than I thought 😅: 1
 Oh okay 😂 well you can show me what you learned from your "date courses" 😘: 1
 More like 80's old: 1
 Yeah totally: 1
 I have no clue how to estimate the styling choice age of a train: 1
 I think it will, older trains are more comfortable than newer ones anyway: 1
 Hope you have fun today 😘: 1
 My fucking train was cancelled: 1
 Yeah, the one to frankfurt: 1
 Oooh, it's one of those: 1
 Any plan?: 1
 i got 2 classes todasy one is already over and the other one is at 14: 1
 Yeah, still BAP, but Cato is probably gonna be here sometime in the next hour. Will see what happens, still not sure where we're going later today: 1
 We now need to find a hotel and check if there are any trains for me to take home tomorrow: 1
 Its a german sleeping song for kids: 1
 Smooth talker 😘: 1
 Finding a train isn't an issue... A hotel for tonight is pretty impossible though 😅: 1
 Patiently biding my time until then. I literally packed my food for the train already: 1
 Well done my love 😘: 1
 Take a deep breath: 1
 Not really but its okay the other people got some ideas we will see: 1
 everything was fine?: 1
 Good morning my night was good sadly didn't dream about you. Hope your day goes smoothly and your team members arrive in time 🤞: 1
 Big dislike: 1
 Mae is not mad at me: 1
 We can?: 1
 Sad but oh well Moustache is just smarter than other cats: 1
 Maybe he does, especially so because halfway through he saw is laugh and said "I think this may have actually happened": 1
 I thought it went well, then we got feedback now I don't know: 1
 Sounds good i guess: 1
 I'm not happy about it, let's put it that way: 1
 Cant sleep ?: 1

 Long overdue 😅: 1

 Nice mabye ask them perhaps they are foing or also wanna go?: 1
 It's alright, work is pretty boring, as is the guy I'm working with. Happy it's only for 2 weeks 😅: 1
 Yeah, but it might storm tonight so we don't know for sure yet: 1
 Man, just looking at the pictures makes me feel like I'm falling in love with you all over again: 1
 Going home now, be there in about 20: 1
 Rest is for the dead: 1
 Yeah we going to Leipzig later to meet up with someone for there birthday. It's quit nice to see him again talk a lot with him about future and stuff everything is settled now.: 1
 Oh sorry: 1
 I didn't get one either: 1
 First solo trip to the sea? Got here safely after more than an hour 😅🥳: 1

 Don't get me wrong, I'm DEFINITELY not complaining, but peak efficiency has already been reached: 1
 Yeah the pictures are great love them too: 1
 I have an exam on Friday so nope, not at all: 1
 You need to eat food hon: 1
 4) she's kinda freaking out about being in a FWB situation in the first place: 1
 You didn't promise, do I have to assume you're gonna steal my identity now? Damn, love really does make blind that I didn't see you're a human trafficking criminal all this time: 1
 Tell me why you're the reason I'm laying awake and not my schoolwork or my first solo car ride? Why I keep imagining you laying next to me in bed? Why I can't get you out of my head ever?: 1
 Yeah, it's really interesting, it's more of a kind of rooibos with then notes of chocolate/cacao, I really like it a lot: 1
 What does she study?: 1
 Can move it if it also works for you 💛: 1
 When we go to your parents, can it please not be Saturday morning?: 1
 But let's hope so for him 😅: 1
 I got my driver's licence 😁😁😁: 1
 Got a Picture of it ?: 1
 How to build a sex room: 1
 Yeah, statistics.... I can't focus 🥲 this is a terrible class to have right now: 1
 The drive was okay just kept thinking about you made me sad so I turned the Music louder and sang along. What did you do the rest of the day?: 1
 Going through the presentation a billion times: 1
 Nah nah, you look fine as hell, what are you even saying at this point??: 1
 No real criticism, it was good fun 😊: 1
 What are you gonna do if no one answers in the discord btw?: 1
 Hope the server stuff is going well: 1

 How is your day going my love? Still BAP until 5?: 1
 Yeah, still waiting: 1
 Wasn't the plan to go to the see?: 1
 duck mabye sunday evenning?: 1
 Okay, I won't come over then. I thought it might be the case, but Alex sent me a message yesterday evening that made me reconsider. He thought me being there would cheer you up. I get wanting to take some time to figure things out, but you're right we can talk about it tonight or whenever you want to. The spelling mistakes are cute 😘: 1
 Did Napoleon smoke?: 1
 sorry: 1
 Let me know when you want to call the morrons: 1
 It's just your dad change his opinion kinda fast.: 1
 Well yes, but then again, he said I wouldn't be able to drive there this year, now it's more of a "maybe in autumn": 1
 yeah can will need to see if i find some: 1
 But it's progress, so I'm not gonna complain: 1
 Sounds like a lovely evening though.: 1
 How and nice: 1
 How is the kitchen cleaning up and packing up going?: 1
 Good or bad?: 1
 I know you can 😘: 1
 Your still in contact with him?: 1
 Okay, how about around? I think I'll have enough time to do math then: 1
 Well okayish still reading the presentation so I got it too 100% in me. Play a few games befor: 1
 Just for the record, I feel the exact same way about you: 1
 I don't think we have dnd tonight?: 1
 Well its a interesting topic 😅: 1
 Like: 1
 Nah, not that big of a fan honestly, at least not in this case: 1
 I'm only saying what I'm 100% convinced of you know?: 1
 Also the cat trick you sent me on Instagram? Does not work with Moustache I'm afraid: 1
 Okay I am done making food what are you up too?: 1
 The goose and you look like Romeo and Juliet on my phone: 1
 I know I shouldn't bring it up again but it's kinda stuck in my head so yeah. I'm still really sorry about 2 days ago and I really fucking hate that I did that the day before we had to say goodbye. I love you way too much to ever want to put you through that kind of thing again. I'll improve on that, I promise. And I know you don't want me to say sorry again but idk, it's still stuck with me and I can't do anything to make it better aside from trying to improve myself on that level.: 1
 Okayish kinda procrastinating but it's okay: 1
 Or is something else up?: 1
 I hope you have fun! The weather in Bergen is... Rainy, so they're definitely having the Norway experience!: 1
 Perfect timing as always ;): 1
 Best option right now 😂: 1
 Of course hon, anytime ❤️: 1
 Ohhh, I see! With everything else I've found out so far that might make Sense: 1
 *Köln: 1
 Let me know when you're actually going to sleep/have finished whatever you still need to do 😘: 1
 Aaaaaah fuck: 1
 … It was very interesting... But opening it in google chrome fucking solved it... I feel fucking stupid, but I'm also so fucking happy it is solved (well, for now that is, watch me run into another brick wall that turns out to be a plastic bag in 5 minutes): 1
 By the way Alex ask if we wanna do a escape room on Sunday's?: 1
 But not as bad as Alex last year: 1
 I am getting really excited for you and it's still 3 days 🥲.: 1
 Goodnight hon 🥰: 1
 Eh, alright: 1
 Decided to go home 🙃: 1
 That changed really last minute then or not? Anyway, have a good time with your parents then 😘: 1
 Oh btw, because I drove to the sea and back yesterday my dad said I might be able to drive to Germany after all, not this time obviously but soon enough : 1
 Okay yeah, that's the same in Dutch, yet again 😂: 1
 Hope so too 😅: 1
 At some point i might not answer anymore but else i woild love too: 1
 I actually have to try not to fall asleep for once, that's... Not something that happens often: 1
 Don't know either, but on Tuesday a bunch of things were out, like Instagram and messenger: 1
 Doesn't say: 1
 Which is it? I still don't know 😂: 1
 It does, but even better would be to just turn around and kiss you a happy anniversary 😘🥺: 1
 I could if I tried to: 1
 Yeah, around 4: 1
 Could do!: 1
 Best ice cream I've had in a LONG time: 1
 Goodnight, please sleep a bit, I'm slightly worried because I found out how much you need to drive... To make it home by 16 I'm not sure you can afford much sleep 😅... But yeah, please take a rest every once so often. ❤️: 1
 Maybe go for a walk if it doesn't rain too much? Definitely try to stretch though, it might help: 1
 Mode: 1
 Alex is there already?: 1
 Maybe it would be nice to ask him for his contact details at the end of the conversation, he sounds like he knows something about what you're doing so it would be nice to be able to ask him questions about it in the future I think.: 1
 My day was fine so far: 1
 My parents and I are just all on the couch, on our phones, in dead silence, there is 1 candle burning to give us some light... 😅 It's... A vibe?: 1
 Found my sunglasses btw, they were indeed in the car : 1
 Still got a second seat or has the streak been broken?: 1
 Waiting for my last train now... Brussel-Midi is so shitty goddamn: 1
 Pretty sure my dad got flashed for driving too fast 😅: 1
 Should also go to sleep yeah 😅: 1
 You're still driving?: 1
 Also heard an American explain the reservation system to a German... I'm pretty sure they're well aware of it and just don't give a damn: 1
 You're also thinking about the kitchen or something else?: 1
 I know I'm doing great I just want to be over with this and with you already 😭: 1
 Well yeah get it's an old folk song so yeah kinda sounds: 1
 Still as shity as ever?: 1
 Apparently his brother now has cancer too and his mom might (they're still investigating it) have cancer again too but in a different organ: 1
 Yeah Frankfurt still really fucking sucks: 1
 It's just a shitty place: 1
 On the train to Erfurt, found a place to sit, hopefully this one isn't delayed: 1
 well hope he burdens you moree: 1
 People speaking German to me 😶: 1
 Taking advantage of my time to schedule a job interview on Wednesday morning because I still don't have a job : 1
 Okay let me put this differently because I see I asked that in a way too hypothetical way. What would you like to do on a date? Or if you don't know that, what would you not like to do on a date?: 1
 Eh, I'm in the kids' zone again so makes sense: 1
 Huh whats going on in the landen down under ?: 1
 Well, 1 hour and 15 minutes but potato patato: 1
 Had a weird dream, but slept fine other than that yeah. Good luck not falling asleep then ;): 1
 Gone go shopping till your here: 1
 Yeah, true, but they're still pretty entertaining for the most part, even if fake: 1
 Yeah didn't think ao but a welcome surprise. : 1
 But it's true that practically living together with you for a month and then suddenly not seeing you anymore is not treating me very well: 1
 Also not hungry at this point so that doesn't help 😅: 1
 Just gonna lay in bed for a while: 1
 The purring: 1
 Ah okay well hope you get it done soon and can relax abit tonight: 1
 Think so yeah: 1
 Around 24, I hope we are: 1
 They're calling a towtruck for us: 1
 But I also got a yellow shirt with the same thing: 1
 Just think about university and looking up some ruley and universitys: 1
 Yeah I already do right now so will get back to it at times: 1
 That's a big hole 😬: 1
 Keep me updated.: 1
 Sorry for your situation hope it turn out good: 1
 Well, the mood went down a bit: 1
 Just my grandma's birthday party, nothing else planned: 1
 I always forget what it's called in English but the thing the clutch controls, yeah, he fucked that up massively: 1
 Hope you have fun at the minigolf: 1
 *incredibly: 1
 Nice hope the job interview goes well 🤞: 1
 Nice?: 1
 I'm really desperate: 1
 Honey, please don't take this as an offence, but I still stand by what I said a while ago, you would have a really hard time finding anyone on a dating app... You have a real talent for just answering in the driest and least interested tone possible, even when I know that's not at all what you meant. It is slightly funny at times: 1
 Yeah understandable: 1
 Only thing I'm afraid of is it becoming a kind of Fretfinder for armpits 😅: 1
 Hotel is in Krefeld: 1
 Ah yeah no, I still like the course, it's just a different prof for this class and I don't like him, he's boring: 1
 Seems harder to pronouns anyway: 1
 No i am in Leipzig with Patrick: 1
 Was good, kinda fun to drive 140 : 1
 I stopped because my legs started cramping, I really don't get how you can drive so many hours after another 😅: 1
 I know, but I guess I needed that more than I thought 😅: 1
 by the way did you do the think you need your dad for for the application for University: 1
 They do but it goes away after a while: 1
 That is definitely a possibility 🥰: 1
 Hmm... Maybe, thanks! What are you up to? Hanging out in Leipzig?: 1
 We are waiting for our food right now and mabye later bowling: 1
 i have no idea. my sister just did somethinks: 1
 Should be in Leipzig around 18: 1
 Watching it again. Just on the site: 1
 Yeah then mabye but eh will see: 1
 What's the plan now?: 1
 Got a spare tire?: 1
 Good morning my love hope you had a great night of sleep. I hope you also got to bed at a reasonably time 😘: 1
 So yes?: 1
 🥹 I love and i hate to hear that. I wanna be there so badly right now.: 1
 You wanna call then?: 1
 Just hope someone picks up the call: 1
 Fucking love that oh my: 1
 I cried out of fear, exhaustion, stress, pain and I guess just a bit of heartache: 1
 You're a cutie 😘: 1
 Yeah I know, it's not like I eat it every day you know?: 1
 Yeah, idk why but I just woke up for some reason 😅: 1
 Damn, that's early, snowboarding is that hard?: 1
 I'm gonna look up what that is I need to know now: 1
 I know sorry didn't want to make you feel bad: 1
 Damm Looks crazy covid is back ?: 1
 Will bring it up hopefully 😅: 1
30 and no one was there?? Maybe they're not even coming today I don't know 😅: 1
 No clue, didn't really check today: 1
 Yeah, sometimes I've noticed that 😅 no worries, just call me when you're done then (what does a while mean though, 30 minutes, an hour?): 1
 If you really don't know anything, just take some frozen pizzas: 1
 Yeah true didnt think about that part: 1
 It's really colourful: 1
 Sleep great. How was your night and what's your plan for today?: 1
 Waiting for a train again: 1
 Yeah naa I am brain dead for the rest of the day sorry 😅: 1
 Joules of the hoodie right now? Yes definitely: 1
 Just watch something really boring: 1
 Well will entertain you for the next 7 days 🥰: 1
 We're gonna go over the answers in a couple of minutes too so that will be interesting: 1
 Will probably stay here for another 20 minutes but at least I don't have to wait on a bench outside: 1
 A wrap, some mais waffles and Netflix + books: 1
 By the way I love Aeneas for taking pictures of you because than I can see your beautiful face. (The magic picture and the one with jinte yesterday): 1
 Okay so I'm taking a train to Aachen: 1
 12: 1
 And from there I'm supposed to ask them how to get to Leipzig: 1
 Just for reference this is my WhatsApp right now 😮‍💨: 1

 This is bullshit honestly: 1
 How bout you?: 1
 Look who says it: 1
 Its the black candy think right?: 1
 okay 🥺: 1
 Thanks hon, does make a feel a bit better ❤️: 1
 No i think resting and stalking some people might be the think you need right now?: 1
 Guess I'll just wait another 2 hours or something for the next train, will see what happens: 1
 Damm nice surprised by that: 1
 Okay I definitely am gonna miss that train unless by the will of some kind of spirit the other train is delayed by 20 fucking minutes: 1
 Baking is going alright I think, I put 1 batch in the freezer and 1 in the fridge, I'm very curious to see which one will turn out better: 1
 Okay, so I miss this one: 1
 Then I will take one an hour later that goes to Erfurt and then from there a train to Leipzig: 1
 Now I'm gonna take a damn shower 😅: 1
 I love you too hon, and I feel the exact same way ❤️😘: 1
 In that case, take care of the necessary things, make sure your friends and family don't hate me for taking you away and then you can come over and kiss me 😘: 1
 Oh no, I'm not gonna die: 1
 I also have one from Putin for some reason: 1
 Well, happened to both of us today then 😅: 1
 Sadly indeed, but we're also making limoncello so you'll be able to taste that at some point: 1
 You should also get some sleep. Your train is at 5 tomorrow?: 1
 Is that how it's written in German perhaps?: 1
 Yeah was really nice also marco is just nice too hang out with again: 1

 ... ridiculous: 1
 Goodnight my love see you in dreamland 😘 cutie ❤️: 1
 Good luck hon, you can do this! 😘: 1
 Yes... I have no clue if there's gonna be a next season though 😅: 1
 It's all in German: 1
 Maybe controversial but I really dislike summer. It's too hot, too many mosquitoes and all that: 1
 Yeah its to calm the blood flow i think: 1
 Idk, think she's working late?: 1
 Yo, you wanna join a call with Aeneas? He's stuck in Lille for another 2 hours 😅: 1
 Okayish was shopping and relaxing for the rest of the day 😅: 1
 That's nice, I'm glad you didn't do too much today 😊: 1
 Same back to you and your the sweetest 😘. Also the most precious girl to me 🥰: 1
 Nothing special, still haven't seen my mom, kinda think we're not gonna do anything for her birthday today idk: 1

 Good morning 😉: 1
 We got a new fireplace kinda thing, and the fucking moron decides to put his paw on it while it's  on 🥲: 1
 I was thinking about the car thing... And the pop-up lights are so fucking cool I don't understand why they didn't make them a special feature? As in you can have the normal lights, but you also have a button to switch between the normal lights and the fancy as fuck pop-up lights. Could even be a feature that costs more than the standard version but it would just be really cool I think: 1
 Huh some more detail please hon wanna know everything: 1
 My sleepshedule kinda fix: 1
 Any other plans for tonight 😏: 1
 no thanks: 1
 You played with legos again or something else this time?: 1

 Eh, lot's of comments so lots of work still before Monday 😅: 1
 Sorbet is something else though: 1
 Happy hon?: 1
 Pretty sure my tram just got into an accident with a car: 1
 I guess they appreciate it a lot because in the past they both had really demanding jobs that made it so they couldn't see eachother for weeks, even when they already lived together: 1

 I still need to ask some people for stuff to do in berlin: 1
 My parents want to go to a club or rave in Berlin 😂: 1
 For the record, I want you to go to sleep after a long day when you are tired or when you feel unwell, I want you to feel good, but it happens so often it is quite frustrating. I don't know if it is because of the times we call or anything else, but I don't want you to be dead tired everytime we call. And it's not just yesterday. It's not just one occasion or two where this happens. It's pretty much every single time we call. When we first talked about this, you said that I always wanted to call so late or so long, and you weren't wrong about that, but now we rarely call for 3 hours. Outside of DnD we call maximum 5 hours a week. When you think about it, is 5 hours a week really that much to spend with your partner? I don't know how you feel about it but I personally don't think so? Yeah, okay, shit happens and we can't always do that I get that, but sometimes it would be nice. And I do realise we call while we sleep sometimes, and man I really love it when we do that, but while it is time we're calling, it's far from actually doing something together. But it does make me feel loved and wanted: 1
 okay why not seems nice: 1
 Yeah i taught it would update: 1
 They also have absolutely no clue where to go or anything: 1
 What does Elias do as a job again?: 1
 Shity being the he wants to quit text: 1
 Nice, have fun, give them my regards/greetings 😊: 1
 That is fucking funny: 1
 My parents are fully on board with you coming over and staying here... On 1 condition 😂... You have to help me study for my driver's exam 😂: 1
 Will do regards back: 1
 Well yeah she is the devil. I hate her too: 1
 Cologne looks like a nice city: 1
 I mean, there's better things to do together but it's surprisingly okay: 1
 How's the business going? Any updates on that? Math was boring, but yeah, that's just the teacher: 1
 I love you hon, but I'm tired so I'm gonna try to sleep now: 1
 Oh yeah right happy birthday from me by the way: 1
 We can text abit more if you wanna too?: 1
 I am at my sister's place now its great: 1
 crazy looks cozy: 1
 Yeah, some: 1
 Oh hon, I hope you can sleep for a long time today 😅😘: 1
 Not home yet, I'll let you know when I am, okay? Will probably be an hour at least though 😅, is that alright?: 1
 You're sweet, I'll try my best: 1
 Make you forget what you actually wanted to do: 1
 Okay! Around Antwerp by any chance?: 1
 This is pure chaos: 1
 Yeah you okay with pushing it back a bit?: 1
 I'm literally trying to convince him we're friends and that I won't just abandon him for going through a shit time: 1
 tomorrow xD sorry: 1

 The party is happening and there's 17 people here, 2 still have to join: 1
 We sat outside in the rain for half an hour: 1
 There's just so much going on I can't follow very well 😅: 1
 My aunt didnt come. We have no idea what's going on and just drove bsck after waiting a while: 1
 The basketball game was great! They're all very good actually and it was really nice to watch, very intense too because the score was evenly matched near the end. Casper ended up winning to everyone's surprise but also delight. Driving went... Uh... Had an argument with my parents mainly because my mom was sitting in the front so idk, not too great. How's your day going?: 1
 I'll live, no worries: 1
 Hmm... I don't like psychoanalysing everyone, but sometimes it helps to talk to them I guess? Idk, I'm just glad I didn't study psychology so I can't actually do it in depth by accident 😅: 1
 HOW: 1
 But goddamn I hate it: 1
 Why but it will be fun: 1
 The advertisements are so bad in Germany like 0 acting skills. It's kinda sad and funny at the same time😅: 1
 Cute cat 🥰: 1
 I passed the fucking exam: 1

 5: 1

 But my voice is very meh 😅: 1
 Idk if you're still hanging out with Ole and Marco but if you are please hang out with them, I can wait 😘: 1
 Okay 🫣: 1
 Burlesque! It was so good!!! If you're here next year (I'm hoping so) we're 100% going together, it was incredible: 1
 Okay nice sounds, well boring but nice that you can help your mom: 1
 She had some... fun times with the friend she 'accidentally' kissed last week: 1
 If I can ask what exactly do you do to help your mom?: 1
 Honestly not that boring, I get to learn a lot about how people try to commit tax fraud: 1
 He won as to be expect: 1
 Actually I think I get it because it's similar for me with your voice. Hearing you just instantly makes me happy: 1
 Also is it bad of me for thinking about not going to the exam but just studying for the next one? 🥲 Chances of me passing this exam are not exactly high 🥲: 1
 How did it go ?: 1
 At least 2-4 an hour: 1
 Well how you feel about that?: 1
 It's a game where you have two teams with x persons and everybody get a beer. The teams stand on a line so parallel towards each other and between is a empty bottle. They have one ball one at a time. They try to throw at the bottle if it falls over they can drink there beer the team that has no bear left wins. They can drink as long as the bottle is on the floor. The other teams need to pick up the bottle.: 1
 Driving home now and then I will go to sleep: 1
 Wait you don't get food there or is it shit?: 1
 Wanna call for a couple of minutes?: 1
 She a a big colab with a rapper but not my style: 1
 Going home now?: 1
 I am happy you won't be alone on your birthday and a lot of your friends come over: 1
 I was wearing my pimp suit pants today and goddamn, I'm 100% sure I lost weight since coming back from Norway and I have absolutely no clue how or why. That or I messed up washing the pants and they became bigger... But I don't think so: 1
 Yeah he is gone see I think. But I hope not for you 😅: 1
 Nope is she german?: 1
 Your up?: 1
 Yup, some of her songs seem to be quite well known too, or maybe that's because of the artists she collaborates with idk: 1
 Good morning Hon hope you still had a good night of sleep even if it was without me 😘: 1
 Yes there is 😘: 1
 Now I kinda want to try to shrink something in the wash just because you said it's hard: 1
 We should really get a shared calendar 😅: 1
 Thanks for the clarification hon: 1
 If you want great dumplings though, there's a really good place in Gent too where I think there's more options: 1
 That being said I have decided on at least 2 things we're gonna do when you're here and yes, both of them are food related whoops 😁: 1
 I was pushed into a meeting that I didn't know anything at all about it at 10, only just got out of there... Fuck that was stressful, I didn't even know the woman's name or anything 😅: 1
 Thanks schat ;): 1
 I've noticed my pants aren't as tight fitting as they used to be, some of them kinda fall off a little bit, but yeah, makes sense you wouldn't notice that, you only see the top of my body usually 😅: 1
 I tried like multiple times to wash a t-shirt with 60° and it didn't shrink: 1
 Oioi: 1
 Hmm... I guess it also depends on the fabric the shirt was made from?: 1
 If you study now, maybe we can still call before we go to sleep? Idk?: 1
 Hmm, help my mom with accounting and probably clean up my room a bit, oh, and I probably should cook dinner too...: 1
 No worrys don't need to explain hope you don't get bullied anymore 😘: 1
 Its not the full song just the middle part which is kinsa rhe most famous part: 1
 Now we sit around and talk alot. It's really nice: 1
 Nice family time sounds good: 1
 Might bake something tomorrow morning if I wake up early enough, but other than that no plans because our kitchen will probably stay like this until halfway through October . : 1
 Yes WE: 1
 Okido, so you still have to pass by Antwerp 😅 : 1
 No idea what that is but sounds shity: 1

 Kinda, my mom is pretty much done with it though, thanks god the deadline is next Thursday so she can relax after that: 1

 I'm not worried about shit: 1
 Good morning Hon. Had a okayish night it was good but just not the same without you 😢Just studying for me today. How is your plan today how is the situation?: 1

 Hahahah, I won't tell them you think that 😂: 1
 Probably not, but most people think they're older because of how tall they are: 1
 I made a fuss about my hairtie to my mom because she need it's for a shower and I feel kinda proud about it: 1
 Some footage from the boat ride: 1
 Hope you're having a good time 😊: 1

 You're cute, I really wish you were there ❤️: 1
 Huh, I think it was yellow at some point last year: 1
 Good i guess nothing much just university and daily activities.: 1
 Well either it was just a lame excuse he used on Tuesday or he need to get more books or foil them or didn't get them all. I would give him benefits of the doubt but I don't know him that well 😅: 1
 But the 7 day index isn't that high: 1
 They are all still asleep?: 1
 She didn't say anything about it 😂: 1
 Maybe i can also take it off at some occasion 😘: 1

 Okay, cool, once Jinte leaves I will let you know, shouldn't be very long from now: 1
 Gonna try to build the streak up again or just leave it at this?: 1
 I'm supposed to ask you if you'd want to with him: 1

 Goodnight hon ❤️ hope you had a great day 😘: 1
 Ah, nah, I'm painting by myself, my dad is just doing his own work downstairs: 1

 Texting sucks: 1
 I just realized I have a dance class tonight... I... My neck... I am SCREWED 😅😂: 1
 Okay, sounds good! Do you think you could come pick me up by 17: 1
 Oh really? Where'd they go to?: 1
 Ahh cutie: 1

 How is studying going hon?: 1
 Yes you are 😘: 1
 Sweet dreams sugar: 1
 Sadly the world doesn't wait for anybody. So yeah: 1
 I'll always worry about you, but thanks for reassuring me ❤️: 1
 What are you doing today?: 1
 Okay nice gone wear it then. With some normal jeans I guess will see you can you can help me pick out my outfit 🥰: 1
 Yeah I know and Alex already showed me: 1
 True it's a time drain: 1
 That does suck: 1
 I will refrain: 1
 They are playing pitbull: 1
 It's pretty funny, also a really nice picture: 1
 Could have also won it, but they both suck at throwing 😂: 1
 Thanks i slept awfully but I think I am still good: 1
 I hope the first exam went well 😘: 1
 I don't know how I can keep missing you more everytime: 1
 70% are good odds, I'm sure it went fine: 1
 Just makes me want you to absolutely violate me in all the rooms of my house: 1
 Half of them are done with a second coat, so tomorrow I'll probably be able to finish it all: 1
 Good luck with the second one 🍀😘: 1
 Yeah, she's doing fine now, had IVF and got twins + going into menopause so it's not that big of an issue anymore: 1
 Great did some studying now making lunch too and then studying with alex a bit till the exam around 15: 1

 But anyway, if you want to, we take the bybanen at 14: 1
 So befor i forget: 1
 I hate sleeping without you: 1
 Tomorrow is your last day at work right?: 1
 By the way your sleep schedule is still fucked: 1
 Oh yeah right no idea send him a mail but Jo response till now: 1
 I'm really really happy about that: 1
 Sounds nice, too bad you were the only one that got the food though: 1
 No mostly talk about future stuff we can and would like to do with them as a partner: 1
 Have fun with your famliy: 1
 Like what kind of things? And who as a partner?: 1
 R42 and will tell you later.: 1
 They're not together but Alex is gonna ask to meet up sometime so maybe it will happen? But yeah, kinda crazy how they find out now they might actually be compatible: 1
 BAP 24/7: 1
 Bad night, you're not here : 1
 Hey, I had a prof today who lost his voice, said the class wasn't gonna be long because he would focus on "the essentials" and then still went over time. On only 17 slides... So yeah, high speed if they manage to get 3 people to do their thing in just an hour: 1
 And if everyone is free that weekend: 1
 Yupppp: 1
 I didn't mean that text as to blame you or anything, it's just stupid coincidence 😭: 1
 Allright back home now need to find some food. And a bit more work on dnd and uni stuff: 1
 However... If you feel like apologising (for nothing) or just randomly feel like it... A voice note of you saying 'I love you' would be very much appreciated : 1
 Aeneas just asked if he can call us tonight: 1
 I love you so much hon and yeah. Hope i dream about you 🥰: 1
 Will do. Please ask him about the girl he lives with, she's kinda... Weird from what he told me today 😅: 1
 How was the party? 😘: 1
 What do you mean a fuss though? I wanna know more: 1
 Nice looks like you gone hold a presentation: 1
 I like it, it's nice. I told her I wanted to be able to put it up because last time it was a bit too short for that. My mom likes and my dad as always never really says anything about it unless he dislikes it so I'm assuming he thinks it's at least alright: 1
 I said she couldn't have it but then she ask for it with please so I gave it to here and I got it back now.: 1
 I just went back to sleep after worrying about it for a while 😅: 1
 If you have any trouble finding it let me know, there's a lot of construction work being done around my city 😅: 1
 Talking to Alex definitely works as well though 😂: 1
 What are you doing exactly: 1
 Uh... Difficult to explain: 1
 Okay you can tell me a another time: 1
 You get what I mean about my voice now??: 1
 Look kinda boring but I have no idea: 1
 I really miss Bergen: 1
 But it's okay: 1
 Goodnight hon, hope you have a refreshing sleep ❤: 1
 I'm alive: 1
 I'm helping out so I'm happy about that: 1
 How's your afternoon going hon?: 1
 And you're probably tired as hell: 1
 I have to do research on it: 1
 Life is weird: 1
 Drahomyr is slowly becoming a very good friend: 1
 Looks good i don't know why but I thought jinte could do it 😅: 1
 Let's put it that way: 1
 Same but I love thing about it: 1
 Good morning my love hope your night was good as well even if it was short 😘: 1
 Pretty sure everyone else is still asleep: 1
 Your day sounds a lot nicer than mine 😅: 1
 I was have a sleep listening to music in my chair: 1
 Now it's 15: 1
 They don't understand Belgian guys, which is completely fair because they're a fucking mess and VERY different from Italian/Spanish guys: 1
 Tonight going back to Gentse Feesten, but this time I think it's only for a burlesque performance, after that I'm gonna go home and sleep 💤: 1
 Okay did you see we won't play dnd on Friday: 1
 Apparently they found a bunch of exclusive oldtimers (Ferrari's, Porsches, etc) in a random warehouse in Brussels, all in bad state because someone left them behind: 1
 Yup, but only until 12: 1
 You got this i believe in you ❤️ love you: 1
 Yeah but I think they would have survived: 1
 Okay, nice 😊: 1
 What are you having for dinner?: 1
 Just like, idk how to explain but he was almost pressing against my back when that really wasn't fucking necessary: 1
 Well... It happened like 3 time, I think the first two were on Aeneas and they both already got annoyed at that time, so the third time before I could even react Anthony had the guy on the floor, Aeneas was shoving him and I was just pulling them back trying to fix it: 1
 Yeah understandable. Really annoying but hope you still had a nice night: 1
 Yeah, no worries, I think Aeneas has a video that shows me dancing (and falling) with Jinte like right after: 1
 Jesus Damm well the had is really nice: 1
 Hoping under the shower now: 1
 Your a cutie 😘: 1
 Your voice does feel warm and fluffy: 1
 Late lunch 😅: 1
 Nope getting ready for bed now 😅: 1
 Day is going great done with class now and volleyball is next. How is your day going my love 😘: 1
 No worrys I will be there for you: 1
 I hope your last day at work goes by fast and you can relax abit befor jinte is coming over.: 1
 I'll send you pictures and videos so you're kinda there with us 😘: 1
 And I just thought of a third idea but I think I'll keep that one a surprise: 1
 *Wooh: 1
 Was at that point already at work yeah 😅: 1
 It's a food market: 1
 Nah, don't feel bad: 1
 Also somehow finished all my work anyway: 1
 Do you think you have time to call tomorrow around 16? I was thinking it would be nice to call when Anthony and Aeneas are here but idk how you feel about it: 1
 Not sure about the 16 but I'll keep you up to date: 1
 Just got home, goodnight love ❤️: 1
 Good morning my love hope you had a great night 🥰: 1
 My silly lovely goose 🥰: 1
 So that means I have just enough time for a shower and a cup of tea to actually wake up 👍: 1
 How is class?: 1
 They found Moustache btw 🥳🥳🥳: 1
 word is on the street that Leipzig has more bridges than Venice??: 1
 Nah, she's almost home. She's just working now 3 days a week, we're meeting up on Saturday : 1
 Oh his side or anything: 1
 It is really freaky, also how long the information is kept is kinda crazy. And now I'm supposed to find a way to capture the utmost amount of information I can... Oh well. Think I might learn a few things along the road, I like this kind of work : 1
 Not going too well, apparently the girl isn't responding well or communicating at all 😅: 1
 I know some people who do this but because of thinking and just forgetting not in a harmful way: 1
 Thanks you make me blush a bit you know that 😊: 1
 That's true, we'll see what happens, Alex is gonna try to set up a date one more time and we'll see what happens: 1
 No worries, I will also root for the Englishman.fuck the Holland guy: 1
 My night was okayish, just dreamt at some point that someone was saying my name and woke up thinking it was real, which was creepy because I'm supposed to be home alone 😅🥲: 1
 Yeahhhh, I get it, just saying that I'm too curious and now I'll be thinking what it could be until then. Actually thank you, now I have something interesting to do tomorrow at work: 1
 Nothing wrong with making some good connections and trying to keep them up though, even if they're people you only see once a year: 1
 Huh what up?: 1
 Sorry for all the spelling mistakes: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you had a better night than yesterday ❤️: 1
 Yeah had a great night 🥰 hope you had a great night too. Already at work and being bored?: 1
 I deserved that 🥲: 1
 I procrastinated till now will get too it: 1
 I've also made a terrible mistake. Jinte and Anthony are going to meet next week: 1
 Will do and you should still enjoy it for the both of us 😘: 1
 Just the paper and relaxing to be honest.  What about you? Planning the trip with Laura?: 1
 Hope dinner is nice 😋: 1
 Sorry for hanging up on you hon ❤️: 1
 My mom ask if you know  Stollen?: 1
 Just dropped the french on the train: 1
 Glad you think so 😂: 1
 Nice what movie?: 1
 Pretty nice, but it's almost time for Raf to go to sleep so idk how long it will still ve: 1
 Morning my love, hope you had a great night 😘: 1
 Yeah kinda sucks but oh well 😅: 1
 It's probably for the best, I don't have the money to go there 😂: 1
 That's great, better continue in that case 😘 ( or eat dinner, idk): 1
 Yuppp, deadly so: 1
 The other student is also nowhere to be found so I don't even have anyone to talk to: 1
 Oh and how is it going?: 1
 hehe well yeah i would gladly help with that: 1
 You can decide: 1
 Yeah, thank god it's only 2 weeks: 1
 Still driving got some fuel now and on our way home probably a another hour until we are at Alex home. Then we get there dog and then to chemnitz so another hour: 1
 Good day (?) Hon, I just woke up so I'd say my is going quite alright 😅: 1
 Done with work for today! 😊 How's studying going hon?: 1
 Will do!: 1
 Hop you had a great nap 🥰 What are you up too hon ?: 1
 Idk, talking about it more could make it easier to talk about but I don't really like talking about it too much either because it's such a stupid thing. People should talk more about salaries and all that, but talking about the money in your bank account feels weirdly personal: 1
 thanks. hope you to soonn: 1
 Ah... you cutie 🥰: 1
 Oh By the way your text "you will get something done" helped love you ❤️: 1
 Damm the minutes are very close: 1
 Damm girl you go I mean you can drive now so it's easier: 1
 Eating and talking with Elias: 1
 Good morning ☺️Relaxing with my friends in his apartment. At 14/15 I drive to my friend who's birthday is today. What about you?: 1
 They really were: 1
 Drive home safe, whenever that is 😘: 1
 Well we are texting to be honest: 1
 Sure thing hon, take your time 😘: 1
 But his name is Ewt: 1
 🥹😢 Miss you too: 1
 Also the thing with all love songs, well, all books too I guess, just everything is about you now: 1
 Is there no limit for this kind of thing? I guess not?: 1
 Will help 🥰: 1
 Deal indeed master ❤️: 1
 It really is weird yeay: 1
 I am getting a plan B for your birthday present because apparently my mom thinks it's stupid 🙃 and now I'm not sure about it anymore either, well, I wasn't sure of it in the first place but ya know, that's just how it works: 1
 (maybe I should wait and see the design first): 1
 Well that's what I am here for 😘 it's all part of my plan 😋: 1
 Fair warning (you do whatever you want) but they all had meat or fish inside: 1
 And then people were also slow on the road, didn't help much: 1
 Yes but mind over body doesn't work sadly: 1
 Now I'm actually crying though : 1
 Had a good 7 hours of sleep: 1
 I don't know, what kind of things does she do/like?: 1
 I just heard my mom say to someone on the phone "yeah, she met a German, one from the East. Yeah, you know, it's something different. Maybe you should go abroad too" 😂: 1
 (and sweet of you): 1
 Why 🥺: 1
 I have to cycle home now: 1
 We want to propose a new flavour to them, so we need to know what they have so far and how people actually think about it... So yeah: 1
 Hmm, we'll see, I just have to make sure I do the laundry today, everything else could wait honestly: 1
 Miss you too hon 🥹: 1
 Fuck it: 1
 Nice now only the last track to gent 🥳: 1
 Enjoy gaming then 😘: 1
 Nope just a hallway: 1
 Thanks hon, hope so too ❤️: 1
 I hope the rest of your day is relaxing hon: 1
 I think they're kinda pointless, you feel bad about not getting them a couple weeks after anyways: 1
 1.5 years max: 1
 Your so cute 🥰: 1
 Forgot to send 🥲: 1
 I REMEMBER: 1
 Worst case scenario is that we don't see each other for 2-3 months, but I don't think it will be that long, we'll figure something out: 1
 Let me know if it's happening or not and I'll pack it: 1
 I think call might be better to avoid miscommunication but I will go along with what you want: 1
 We also have the largest and one of the last populations of a very specific type of spider (don't know if my translation is correct but the spring fire spider): 1
 9: 1
 Man the texting thing is still confusing me sometimes: 1
 Goddamn, uhm... I need to think about this one: 1
 both: 1
 damm sucks: 1
 I know she looks like a child: 1
 Nice hope that lifts the mood a bit: 1
 I'll be there around 14 tomorrow: 1
 Love to read that a lot 🥰: 1
 I would, but quite frankly I don't have any time until Monday and I'd rather call you anyway, but I get it if you don't want to: 1
 Oh yeah, the mood is totally fine now: 1
 Hope you have a save trip home hon 😘: 1
 Still waiting did have something todo when do you think you will be home?: 1
 No clue, gonna when I get home, what's your plan for tonight still?: 1
 My night was nice, spent some time on the beach and then we went to the restaurant and the food was amazing 🤩: 1
 Cooking with Alex and studying mostly 🥲: 1
 Thanks for caring though hon ❤: 1
 Yeah no i think we just feel the same but think im different ways sometimes. But i get what you mean.: 1
 Got home, I drove most of the trip, I feel sorry for making you drive through Antwerp every time... It wasn't even busy and I fucking hated it 😅: 1
 Yeah, gonna make some dinner, take a shower and then probably go to sleep: 1
 Done for today: 1
 Sounds nice. What you gone make?: 1

 I'm happy for you: 1
 Got to the hotel, it is fucking giant: 1

 Hahaha, no photocollages yet 😂: 1
 Hmm... do you really want to know? I... fucked up: 1
 I'm going homeeeee: 1
 My bed still smells like you 🥰😍😍🥰: 1
 Barehands ?: 1
 You're way too cute 🥺🥰: 1
 Was good, had pasta at a nearby restaurant. Wasn't gonna go at first but my parents convinced me to at least walk there and then decide: 1
 I'm jealous your bed smells like me, wish it was the same: 1
 She likes sentimental gifts: 1
 Your mom is nice and sorry for your dad 😅: 1
 Christophe, one of my parents' friends: 1
 hope it comes back fast: 1
 I am sorry for you 😢: 1
 Yes, true, but any step like this is always kind of difficult to get used to I guess: 1
 I'm starting a glossary to write down all the words I don't understand though 😅😂: 1
 Maths: 1
 But yeah, I'll try to move on from it now I guess 😅: 1
 If killing one ends up with me getting some painting thrown on top of me, 100% worth it: 1
 Okayish procrastination is still strong: 1
 It's chill, waiting for my grandpa still: 1
 But this is one of the art pieces we saw on our walk yesterday 😅: 1
 Today was marketing for a hardware store: 1
 Also question about our spicy stuff or in general: 1
 Gone help your dad soon?: 1
 Maybe if the fire alarm goes off?: 1
 Oh no, it's the 15th of March: 1
 So your back home again?: 1
 You know, I'm really starting to think you're partially Canadian: 1

 Meeting up tomorrow?: 1
 What are you thinking of mister? It's a 599 pages book, if that's porn without a plot I will be severely surprised. No no, I'm only reading it because of the Finnish hockey player who is the main love interest and asks the main character to marry him in Finnish the whole time so she doesn't understand him.: 1
 Although there is of course _some_ chance that I might pick up some ideas, who knows?: 1

 She also has a pdh in neuroscience so she's fucking cool: 1
 But thanks for the suggestion nonetheless: 1
 So... Yeah, a lot: 1
 Good morning my love hope you had a good night 🙏🏼😊: 1
 What are you going to do now?: 1
 I would be laughing out loud at this message if I wasn't on camera: 1
 What's up is my love for you ;p: 1

 Well, miscommunications are there to be figured out I guess 😅: 1
 True true, I definitely don't mind it: 1

 Nop not at all 😅. It's about the freedom of thoughts and that you can think what your want: 1
 Ah, okay, cool: 1
 Damm she is going around the world nice. Why is she doing a internship in her first year?: 1
 Hahah, nah, don't worry, we can do it tomorrow 😊: 1
 I would never: 1
 Also random question, but have you ever been on a plane? Because I don't remember: 1
 Okay, because my mom asked me and I didn't know and she was like "how do you not know that?": 1
 I just realized that the future the think I was waiting for was now. I could go where ever I want to and I could do next in life what ever I want to. So I start doing more stupid stuff with my friends and everything I got the chance too.: 1
 Hold up hold up, sorry, I don't understand that sentence 😭: 1
 Eh, we'll see, it pays good but the hours kinda suck: 1
 Okay, you can do that 😘: 1
 But I fully agree that you come first 😘: 1
 Sounds like a productive evening 😊: 1
 We going to the free food think now to talk to some people. Hope the dizzy goes away and you have a nice night 😘: 1
 That's fair, I definitely get that: 1
 Yeah would love that: 1
 My mom can't talk, everyone went to the Depeche Mode concert and she went to a shopping mall to read a book 😂: 1
 How dare you say that: 1
 She hasn't answered if she can actually go on that day: 1
 How was your night? Still in bed or already on the go?: 1
 Nah, haven't gotten any pictures at all, kinda sad: 1
 Good morning hon, hope the party was nice and you got some good sleep too 😘: 1
 Sams back though😘: 1
 I don't think I necessarily have inherited any traits that I dislike, or maybe I just haven't discovered them yet? But some traits I do sometimes like and dislike are my rationality and ability to 'turn off' my emotions? It's very handy sometimes but it's also a defense mechanism that is very easy to get access to but also shuts people out.: 1
 My day's pretty boring honestly+ I didn't get lunch because I forgot it at home 😅: 1
 Nah, I'll just quit earlier: 1
 Eh, I had some mais waffles and still have a honey waffle, I'll power through probably: 1

 Damm didn't think so at first but it's kinda getting hot 🤒😏: 1
 I sure hope it's not. I know on my side it's not, I'm pretty sure you being in my life has improved so many things, it's crazy: 1
 Nope, Jinte and her family: 1
 Goddamn, there really isn't a word for that in English... That sucks. In Dutch it's 'voorlaatste' how about German?: 1
 Tutoring again? Is it for different courses or all the same one?: 1
 Going home early today: 1
 There's 2 buildings, and because we booked so late we have 2 separate rooms so now I'm sleeping in a different building: 1

 Nope, at least I don't, my dad did invite several people over for dinner tonight though, so for datenight I'll try to sneak away 😅 might be a bit later (9 or something 🥲) if that's okay with you?: 1
 I don't really like it too much either, it's always somewhat stressful, especially when it's with someone else because I know how much money I can spend, but I have no fucking clue what is in someone else's bank account. I feel the same way with you, but it still makes me feel kind of weird just having this kind of business transaction? If that makes sense?: 1
 hmmm yeah well you got this and its 13 no ?: 1
 Well I will send you more no worries 😘: 1
 I can't say I regret anything because I'm quite happy with where I've gotten so far, but maybe I regret not telling the people in my life that I really appreciate them enough. Or just... Being sentimental? Especially towards my parents, we rarely ever talk about emotions and I can't even remember the last time I told them I love them by myself, even if I really really do.: 1
 I wanna hug you so bad right now: 1
 Samw literally same: 1

 No worrys i will pick you up: 1
 You always do this 😭: 1
 Shock: 1
 I'm happy to hear (read) that!: 1
 I thought it was on Wednesday but apparently it's not 😭: 1
 What time do you have your first class tomorrow?: 1
 Yeahhhh, but I get him, I would also be pissed off if someone locked me in a tiny room without proper explanation: 1
 On the train to Leipzig now: 1
 Okay, buying the ticket then 😊: 1
 Oh well need to bring them the news. 😅: 1
 For the record, my hard time believing it is simply because I have a hard time imagining it and not because I think he isn't able of it: 1
 no worries 😘: 1
 Arg: 1
 Also weird topic of how great of a dad he would be: 1
 Sorry need to write the Text while I drove: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you had a good night, even if we both went to sleep so late 😅😘: 1
 Wait until it goes back on?: 1
 Yeah, waking up fucking sucks : 1
 Wait are you for real a member now and what's coming with the membership?: 1
 Well if you say so I am not gone procrastinat 🥰: 1
 Let me know how that plan works out! ;p: 1
 Hon, if you want to go, just go: 1
 I have my secrets 😋: 1
 Btw, if I seem like I'm not as happy as I usually am or if I say things in a different way, I'm just having a bit of a difficult time, I promise that's just it: 1
 Had a shitty night but okay. Yeah at my parents house right now and then just family time: 1

 Get that and i am silly 🥰: 1
 Well jinte is sometimes too smart.: 1

 Also cant wait for my hand around your neck again 🥰: 1
 I am driving back now from Leipzig so gone be there i a hour: 1
 I'm genuinely trying not to be annoyed right now but I hope you understand that's kinda difficult. I know you couldn't do much about it but I could have done something else tonight and I decided to stay home to call you. Initially at 8, then at 9 and now apparently closer to 10. Once again I know you couldn't do much about it, but I also would have liked it if you communicated what was going on before, rather than just now telling me you're leaving and will be home in an hour. I wouldn't have been in this position of trying not to be annoyed because I know it's not your fault if you'd just said "hey, it's gonna be difficult to be on time, is it okay if we reschedule?" : 1
 Also EYES ON THE FUCKING ROAD BUDDY: 1
 Love you and hope i dream of you goodnight ❤️ <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Your internet okay?: 1
 Walking home form where I parked takes like 10 more min than I will call you: 1

 Whoops, sorry, yeah, it's an American idiom I guess?: 1
 * Nice hope you can send me a picture of you later. 😘 cutie: 1
 A girl I met during an after school debate program in high school, we met up last year for lunch I think, every so often we think about each other and send a message, and with every so often I mean quite literally once a year: 1
 I love that I can tell you anything: 1
 IT'S KARAOKE: 1
 The book was interesting but then ending was shit: 1
 Okay I understand I'll leave you alone: 1

 Working for school and then work, apparently it's gonna be fucking busy so I'm gonna be dead. You?: 1
 We will be there i like 40 - 50 min: 1
 Sounds nice 🥰. Me and my parents went too our aunt for coffee and cake. But we stayed for too longe so we are eating out now. It's quite nice a lot of drama on my aunt side her boyfriend cheated and i didn't know about so I got the full drama story today.: 1
 Means I could be there the 23rd if you'd want that: 1
 Hmm, difficult, I can say I need to be home by 7 though. Gerardo already left because he has actual work now : 1
 It's fine though, I'm home alone anyway tonight: 1
 Oh yeah true how is your period going down or less?: 1
 Huh your parents gone have a dinner without you or what's up?: 1
 Not gonna just decide on it now but the idea is growing on me to just work until September: 1
 Or you dont wanna to?: 1
 xD my family already got a back up plan if Germany is out. They are switching to the Belgium player: 1
 Fair, and then you stayed up so late too 😅: 1
 Trying to study but headache and procrastination taking control 🥲: 1

 This situation is actually a really good case to explain how some people (mostly girls) don't always want a solution, I just wanna bitch about them 😅: 1
 Thanks hon 🥰 hope you have a relaxing evenninig: 1
 You're a peach!: 1
 Not yet, will see what Cato says once their work is over: 1

 I am 100% overthinking shit again 🥲, should have never read that website yesterday : 1
 I also worked until 17 today because I only started at 9: 1
 Wanna talk about mabye you can get it out of your system and i can give my opinion: 1
 It's quite fun: 1
 No, there is a third possibility. I ovulated in the 3 days between and then it's fucked too, honestly that's what I'm most worried about: 1
 But we'll see I guess: 1
 Then again, idk, I think everything is just kinda getting to me and I'm choosing to overthink this thing because it's the least in my control at this point. I'm sorry I'm bothering you with this, I feel like I should be more positive about things 😅: 1
 Oh yeah I don't know what to right about that. Just need to wait for your next period.: 1
 Don't know for sure first think I told him was to do something with her spend time get to know each other. But he told me he needs a starter or a starting conversation because he never talk to her except for group stuff so he is kinda scared.: 1
 Yuppp… Guess so, the waiting game really sucks though: 1
 Studying not great, haven't done anything good so far, which is why I need to get up 😅: 1
 Is it dutch or English?: 1
 Yeah got a good night and got up on time no worries 😅. In class right now. How was your night?: 1
 Yeah but atleast we both don't want to stay: 1
 Had a weird dream again, but slept quite alright 😊: 1
 Oh no you didn't 😳: 1
 Crazy sounds nice thought but 2 Month for plane tickets 😅: 1
 Makes sense on their part: 1
 I'm just trying my best to be a good friend 😅: 1
 Yeah, I slept alright. This morning I haven't got anything planned (was planning on sleeping in but clearly that's not happening) then I have to work a couple of hours in the afternoon and then we are going to the sea for the evening 😊: 1
 Good idea will do the same 🥰: 1
 Oh, that's too bad, I hope he feels better soon!: 1

 Good luck in class. Lunch was nice, talked a lot with the new intern. We're probably gonna go out at some point this weekend so I can show her around Ghent. : 1
 Seems like a him thing to do yeah: 1
 Sorry but I am glad it smells like you so much: 1
 The famous one is from Falco: 1

 Food is also mostly shit: 1
 Found a seat and am on the train : 1
 Hahah, okay, have fun hanging out then! ❤️: 1

 Okay. You know I want to know how you feel about things too right?: 1
 Who made the comment and yeah mabye in some relationship but i dont think its in ours the case: 1
 Please send me a picture once you went to the hairdresser 🥺: 1
 I didn't notice to be honest: 1
 Imagine trying to fuck someone with a nerf gun though... That's just weird: 1
 Oh yeah, he's gonna complain against the use of ChatGPT on Thursday, but he told us to make our lives easier that we could use it... Kinda hypocritical 😅😂: 1
 I have my presentation at 14 so I have more than enough time to go for a drink with my teammates and then go home to pack my bag, have a good night sleep and take the train: 1
 I wanna say in the group chat that meeting people from Norway helps me with that but with out insulting or shaming him you know what I mean: 1
 We'll wait outside: 1
 Going ro Leipzig now: 1
 Mabye i should ask her when your birthday is?: 1
 How would that insult him?: 1
 Eh, woke up around 6, other than that it was fine I guess, still really tired right now though 😅: 1
 Yeah he ask me too but I am too kø to call.: 1
 It's okay, a bit fast but I'll catch up, not feeling good with paying attention today 😅 but it's a program to use so I'm sure it will be fine: 1
 Still quite a while but hey, you'll get there!! ❤️: 1
 Studying and relaxing a bit not much: 1
 You had a nice evening?: 1
 I just saw the dad's tab and... Makes sense that he's drunk Jesus Christ: 1
 Just any way to get close to you: 1
 Yeah it is but oh well extremest what can you expect: 1
 Yeah but i think it should be the same as the English one: 1
 I found a reason my reason to hate them now: 1
 Then again I also feel like anything I did right now would be terrible anyway... Fuck this shit. I'm actually gonna go insane over the next 2 weeks, just watch me I guess 😅: 1
 You got this babe no worries. But I gone go sleep now : 1
 Sleep is evading me and thinking of you and how much I love you is honestly the only thing that is even slightly calming me down at this point, make of that what you will: 1
 Hmm, nah, I think I'll have you wait for it: 1
 I hope you're having a wonderful night sleep though 😘: 1
 Oh yeah, definitely: 1
 There were riots in Leipzig?: 1
 Yeah they were because of a judgement on some left vs right stuff nothing new I guess: 1
 Didn't you have a meeting with Lara today?: 1

 I don't know just my mood right now: 1
 You better eat something soon and sleep when you get home love 😤😘: 1
 My dad now wants to buy a Tesla _and_ a Porsche: 1
 Hehe just enjoying being mean to you sometimes 😅 hehe: 1
 I mean yeah, kinda makes sense when you're supposed to be the people leading by example for your people. At least that taboo has been pretty much broken nowadays but it's still weird: 1
 What's up hon? How's your day going so far?: 1
 Yeah Quatsch is a typ of bullshit or never its weird if I think about it: 1
 Sorry, I should have communicated that better: 1

 Yeah of course no problem! I mean, I have her number already so it's only fair 😅: 1
 No killing yourself over someone you knew for only a day AND no pedophilia: 1
 I don't remember a lot of it, but I think you and your Alex came over to my parents' house on a trip or something. But you guys were only going to be here for a short time so we couldn't spend a lot of time together. In the morning (we didn't sleep together because Alex insisted you sleep with him) you guys got up and I thought you were going to leave already, but instead you were gonna go pick up my dad (from where???) but then we ended up at a shopping mall and I got lost. That's all I remember 😅: 1
 Did t sleep well but it's okay no tired right now 😅. How was your night?: 1
 Still 14: 1
 It's not about the subconscious I think, more about not being stuck to your body I guess? I think they want a sort of superconscious: 1
 Did I just fall asleep yesterday or did we say goodnight and ended the call?: 1
 I personally think it's a bit too much: 1
 Hope you like the candle and it gives you a little motivation: 1
 No so bad just doing university stuff in the library because I procrastinat less 🥲: 1
 You allways know what to say 😳: 1
 Honey, the I guess wasn't meant to critique you 😭: 1

 Yeah actually thought about asking you for tonight if you wanted to call but you on step a head: 1
 Hmm... Pizza is great: 1
 Just let me know when you want to call tonight, I don't have anything planned anyway, or just straight up call me, that also works 😘: 1

 Nah, didn't go to law class with Alex, she couldn't go to class again, this time because she had to feed her brother... He's 18 but okay I guess 😅: 1
 Yeah... Maybe, but I still don't like the gods: 1
 Get some sleep then 😘: 1

 In Belgium we don't have the stickers because it's all checked by our numberplate: 1
 Co-evolution?: 1
 No, I think we're gonna order it online, but I think you need it for your car too? Unless you wanna take a train to Berlin, that works too: 1
 It's only €6 so my dad is gonna get it anyway: 1
 Ah okay well hope its still good food then: 1
 On Wednesday we all get there, then we go to the unterwelt, a 2 hour tour about tunnels underneath the Berlin Wall. After that we go eat at a stube (?) On Thursday we go on a three-hour bike tour in the morning, afternoon is still free and then in the evening is the fancy restaurant called Tisk. That's about it. And on Saturday I think we leave around 4 or 5 (though my dad was talking about extending it one more day so idk for sure about that one): 1
 Oh yeah, you ever heard of a singer called LEA?: 1
 Damm that's really a asshole move. Also they keep listening all the time: 1
 They do 😭... Can they please not fucking remind me though? I was blissfully forgetting about it and now I'm anxious again... Bastards... Anyway, hope you have a nice dinner with your parents 😅😘: 1
 Maybe yeah: 1

 (just getting on a tram now): 1
 We should still talk about it next week of course, I just want to let you know I appreciate you and your willingness to deal with my emotional bullshit 😅: 1

 Sorry forgot my phone today at the airbnb: 1
 Will definitely talk about it at somepoint after the holiday. Also glad it help sending me the texts so you got it out and i love reading even if its something "bad" or not "good news". Please keep texting me in these kinds of moments 🙏🏼💙. I am also not sure how i gonna survive the next two days because they are packed with nice stuff todo which we planed along the way mabye just abit lot <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 All day or just this afternoon?: 1
 All day forgot it on the mountain too: 1
 I did think it was gonna be a lot, but it has also been something on my mind before the trip, but yeah, we can talk about it later. But yeah, a group trip is a lot anyway.: 1
 Weird, it says on my phone you read my messages around 12: 1
 You'll live, enjoy all you can: 1
 Sweet dreams 😘: 1
 Mabye he wants to do it in person?: 1
 Let me be your safe haven when you need it: 1
 12? Really weird: 1
 Get home savely 💙: 1
 With my parents, will be fine: 1
 I will try too: 1
 If it doesn't take too much time: 1
 Oh, and because you asked about my day (not), was okay, just went to dinner with my parents, aunt, Pieter and one of Pieter's friends who moved to the US to be with his fiancee. They did long distance for a while too. He offered me some advice. Cool guy, constantly on his phone but makes sense because his fiancee is awake right now <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 This advice was kinda bullshit but oh well: 1
 Sorry wanted to believe me: 1
 But still nice dinner?: 1
 I just wanted to talk about my day, I was trying to joke about it but I probably shouldn't 😅: 1
 Whats the meesage you deleted?: 1
 Did you ever look at the lyrics?: 1
 I will not load need to get to a new place: 1
 Cutie feel that song text: 1
 New favorite song?: 1
 No, don't have any favourites right now, but I thought I should send it to you: 1
 Still cant read your messages on locked thing: 1
 Something is really off with the app then: 1
 I see them as a notification but cant see them on the app: 1
 Yes also i am feeling really exhausted today. Dont know if its the socializing or drinking yesterday? But i dont have any energy <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Could be worse, could be better, but not productive at all so far: 1
 Rest up and drink enough water: 1
 Goodnight hon love you and try to sleep abit early today and hope you don't over think tonight and tomorrow(either way you dont have time for that 😋): 1
 Something I don't want to talk about over text, but nothing bad: 1
 Yeah no get what you mean. Also think its something to talk about with a call?: 1
 Until I come to Germany you mean?: 1
 Because that's still almost a month and I'm not sure it would be a good idea to wait until then, even if it would be better to talk about it in person: 1
 But we can definitely wait until next week (for obvious reasons) <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 I really fucking love you, even when I'm having a hard time feeling connected to you because of the distance 💜: 1
 I love you and all the things you are made out of: 1
 Goodnight my lovely goose 💜: 1
 Cutie hope soo too for you ❤️: 1
 I hope when you feel bad or when you need/want something from me, you feel comfortable asking and talking to me about it too <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Weren't you thinking of moving there with Alex though?: 1
 Its been way too long since last time i went: 1
 Yes sadly 🥲: 1
 When was the last time?: 1
 2017/18: 1
 6-7 years ago... yeah that's a long time for sure: 1
 Who do you get along with best in the group (other than your fiancee obviously): 1
 oh and watching my mom run through the house and do chores: 1
 Probably flo because i know him a while now, then maybe nici. But they are all nice. Its also not getting weird talking to them <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 How do you know all of them actually? I'm glad it's not weird talking to them: 1
 Most of them though marco meet them a few time(mabye 3 or so). Some never see: 1
 That's good, maybe you have some new friends you can hang out with after the trip: 1
 Yes by far: 1
 And can I kindly remind you that most of your friends now live in Leipzig which is also an hour away?: 1
 Nevermind fabian, who lives in freaking Potsdam: 1
 Keep the old ones you know: 1
 Which is why this is a great opportunity to do so if you feel like it but yeah, I guess I get what you mean: 1
 For 7 days: 1
 mount train think? you mean the skilift?: 1
 Those things have got to be difficult and often in upkeep: 1
 Yeah but its alot: 1
 Clearly it is fucking insanely expensive but yeah, what do you do about it?: 1
 Where in god's name did you get that money from: 1
 Sorry just being weird about asking someone for a picture or taking a selfie with the group: 1
 Not good: 1
 Tell me more where did not good start?: 1
 Bit better now because my mom came home and practically forced me to put my shoes and coat on and literally pushed me out the door to take a walk, but still not amazing: 1
 Good job from your mom and thank her from me 🤗: 1
 Yeah i am still sorry and also thaught about alot today. My tried mind just went to the stupid ways of possibilities: 1
 I woke up feeling shitty because of overthinking, then found out I was not gonna make it to class on time, more overthinking, more overthinking, found out my second class wasn't happening because my teacher was sick, more overthinking, finally managed to drag myself out of bed and into the shower at 14, almost fainted, ate food, tried to do something for school and follow class but that didn't really work well because it was online and boring as fuck, and then more overthinking: 1
 It was also just really shitty timing though. On any other day it wouldn't have been an issue, just yesterday (and possible if it happened today too) because of how I was already feeling: 1
 Ah i see. Man i feel bad sorry again and again. Should have send you some more texts from stopping over thinks 🥲: 1
 Kinda hard to ski and text though I would guess: 1
 Though would have appreciated the pictures you promised me this morning : 1
 Yeah really shitty time form me fucking up. Please dont thinks at any point in time that you did something wrong about the way your feeling at the moment it just happens at times. But i sadly also not there i am just assuming the worst: 1
 Its crazy: 1
 I don't think you knew how I was feeling already at that point though, but yeah, what happened happened: 1
 Honey... are you telling me no one in the whole group that is there with you is taking any pictures whatsoever?: 1
 Yes they are but feeling weird to ask them to send me the picture. They one make a Google docs foldee for the at the end.: 1
 I think you mean "german": 1
 Well yeah only to new people. If somebody brings a friend them mabye thats okay but thats the line: 1
 But if you don't feel comfortable sending pictures, at least tell me something interesting that happened, all I'm doing is going to classes while you're in fucking Austria in gorgeous mountains with a whole group of friends and you don't tell me anything that is happening 😅: 1
 Man, my parents asked how you're doing and all I could say was "Okay I think? He said he fell once" and that was it: 1
 Ahhhh: 1
 Today it was marco flo and Niklas. Really nice and learned me abit more about it.: 1
 They are all that much better?: 1
 Because I wouldn't if that were you, no offense, I would try to talk you out of it until you were up in space: 1
 Okay hon the just saying: 1
 I love you too muffin ❤: 1
 Okay how did he do that? Smart that i thaught he would?: 1
 And my dad was almost convinced: 1
 But he thankfully asked me if he already had food: 1
 He doesn't need to get more fluffy than he already is: 1
 You got this hon i believe in it: 1
 Uhu, okay: 1
 Can i not?: 1
 I mean, I guess you can, but it doesn't make a lot of sense: 1
 If you want to be?: 1
 I'm just saying this to explain: 1
 Has nothing to do with capabilities and determination outside of that: 1
 That's why I specified untrained: 1
 But yes, however I do have a big fear of space so chances of me going up there alive and conscious are very very slim: 1
 Social interaction: 1
 Okay in that i do belive in you: 1
 I don't know if I will survive tomorrow but will let you know if I do I guess: 1
 Please do that too 😘 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Get a good nights rest then 🥰💙: 1
 Will do, I promised Alex to introduce them because otherwise she has no one to go to facts with 😅: 1
 Btw, do you still get all my locket pictures? Because some of them disappeared when I look at it and it's weird: 1
 I will take your word for it then: 1
 Okay, noted, if I ever want to go skiing I need a lot of money: 1
 Maybe I can get a student job next year so I can save up for the next  years, maybe then I'll get there: 1
 Mabye that can help: 1
 I would hope so: 1
 Can I ask you a question I might not want the answer to?: 1
 What's the worst thing you have ever thought about me?: 1
 Mmmh: 1
 No idea to be honest you are saved in my mind as a really unreasonable perfect person.: 1
 Some small thinks but we all have that. And its normal: 1
 ITS NORMAL too feel weird sometimes and its fine. I still love you. If your overthinking hon: 1
 Oh okay yeah no will never happen: 1
 The food was meh but company was great so yeah. His advice was to get married: 1
 Sorry really sorry: 1
 I love you too: 1
 Your cute and i hope you can trust me i will not disappoint: 1
 Because you will overthinking that i am sure of: 1
 I also don't think you understand that I'm really really not afraid of you cheating on me: 1
 Family busy is a different kind of busy for sure, hope it's fun ❤: 1
 That's not even what I meant with the forgetting part: 1
 Oh ups sorry misunderstanding that then: 1
 Yeah, I probably should have explained that a bit more sorry: 1
 I know you are busy and I don't mind it, you should be busy and not concerned with me the whole time: 1
 But I don't think I'm gonna get drunk all that soon 😅 but maybe I will graduate from one drink to 2 on Friday: 1
 Ah i see nice will watch it too then: 1

 After we talked on Sunday there were a couple of things still on my mind, but the one I am most curious about is if you ever feel like you're chasing me? Because from your reaction it seemed that way and I don't know, I just want to know if that's true: 1
 Yeah sometimes it feels like that. Its only over text but its still there you know: 1

 Damm crazy. Good job wingwoman 👍🏻: 1
 Sorry to hear that but didn't you wont to set her up with someone?: 1
 Yes but I also was there with only Alex and I was sober, so having Alex make out with someone for 10 minutes kinda left me standing alone in a corner rethinking life: 1
 I literally had to pull her away because someone else made a comment about it: 1
 And honestly... The girl literally walked up, asked if they could kiss and they did... Grounds to build a relationship? None that I can see but who knows: 1

 Btw, do you know anyone who really likes the Simpsons?: 1
 I would say the odds of this kind of thing happening are just higher today, with carnival and a cycling race both happening in Gent a lot of people are getting drunk: 1

 Probably also should figure out what to eat tonight because my parents are going out again: 1
 Yeah the think with your aunt i knew but the Carnival parade ? Is it abig think in belgium/gent?: 1
 I didn't tell you about this last year? It's not that huge of a deal I guess, but it passes by right outside of our house so it's quite nice to watch as it's only once a year: 1
 Hmm... Maybe I could do something like that: 1
 The parade takes like half a day to get around and then there games and drinks in the evening but we never go to those: 1
 oh yeah right now we were there together i think yeah right nevermind i remember. Ah nice hope you steal some candy from the children jk: 1

 Holy shit I am lucky: 1
 Good morning muffin ❤️ (although god knows when you'll actually see this): 1
 Btw, who's everyone on the trip?: 1

 On the mountain now can't really text: 1
 Then text me later duh: 1
 I hope you're having a great time: 1
 Never heard of that game: 1
 House: 1

 Doesn't matter, shopping sucks anyway so I hate that this didn't work: 1
 I will take it that you do not have time then : 1
 Was nice got fucking recked on the skys today head was spinning: 1
 I do not understand if that means you're exhausted from skiing all day or if someone crashed into you and that's why your head was spinning, but I'm glad you had a good time and hope you're not hurt 😅: 1
 I crash myself into the floor. But also exhausted but all good now. But also all good with crash got schooled really nice and sweet of the others: 1
 They do love skiing: 1
 Okay thx: 1
 Sorry that i kinda ignored the message but i was just really tired. Where are you and whats up?: 1
 I'm with my parents and aunt and Pieter where my dad's party will be held in June, a lot more nature than I'm used to: 1
 We only got here last night so we literally just went out for dinner, took a short walk and went to sleep, today I'll take some pictures though 😊: 1
 Damm that looks just French which makes sense becaus its france 😅: 1
 Hehhe: 1
 😁: 1
 If you think so: 1
 Aw shit: 1
 That sucks: 1
 There are alot of people from the Netherlands: 1
 Tell you more tonight: 1
 Alex was also planning on going skiing this weekend though so it's possible not: 1
 It's really weird to see people break up like this: 1
 Looks like a nice route. Poor bus though 🥲 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 My mom wants to come back with her car to prove you can do it with a normal car but my dad doesn't believe it: 1
 Could be working but you really wanna test it also look for rain befor: 1
 That's nice, looks much better than before: 1
 Around 6 to 7 hours: 1
 Yeah one more uur: 1
 Eyyyyy, represent 😂: 1
 We just got home: 1
 Yes ate fast: 1
 Still interesting how you really only ever tell me about your day when I ask you to: 1
 I've been having an anxiety attack for pretty much all of today and maybe you can tell that my overthinking of yesterday hasn't stopped yet, I shouldn't be talking to you like this: 1
 My day is going great. We been ski like the last 2 days. Like a day here is planned like: 1
 Sorry to hear the kinda wanna call later if you want to?: 1
 Yeah marco is my roommate: 1
 Okay omw to the shopping store text you back in abit: 1
 k: 1
 I would probably text around 21?: 1
 Ca va: 1

 You ate already then?: 1
 Only if you actually want to talk to me though, I don't want to burden you with this: 1
 What was for dinner?: 1
 Pasta with tomatoes soup not really but like the think wait: 1
 Huh, sounds kinda weird, like vermicellis or really just normal spaghetti pasta?: 1
 Okay then, hope it tasted good: 1
 How was your dinner hon?: 1
 How is your day going by the way?: 1
 Are you all taking turns cooking or how does it work?: 1
 Was okay, pizza: 1
 Yes. We every "couple" needs to cook for one day and 2 days are still open because nothing is planned there yet: 1
 Marco and me 😅made pizza: 1
 At least have the decency to wait until I respond to your message?? No? I responded within the same minute and you just poofed already <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Okay, I just noticed a pattern so I was curious: 1
 Okay in bed now ready to text abit or fall asleep very fast: 1
 Will go too sleep just really tired 😅: 1
 Will text you tomorrow: 1
 Rude but okay: 1
 If you're gonna tease me by saying we can text and then go to sleep like that then I expect at least a shit ton of pictures tomorrow <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Because that is just plain rude: 1
 Didn't sleep and my teacher is again too late: 1
 Just leaving me hanging like that...: 1
 I could say so many things about this 🙄: 1
 Just in case you care: 1
 Enjoy all the time you have together 😘: 1
 Leaving me to know nothing at all: 1
 That's just called being a fucking tease <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 And I wouldn't know which of two because I know nothing: 1
 And yes okay you were tired I get that but it still made me feel bad because you said you would text me in the evening and then when it was evening you said you could either text for a bit (and honestly I wouldn't have cared if it was only 5 mins) or fall asleep really fast. And as usual, you chose to go to sleep over talking to me and without even looking at my goodnight message back or anything, which gave me the idea that you clearly never are excited to talk to me about anything like I am usually excited to talk to you (yes overthinking but why the hell do you think I'm still awake right now?): 1
 I do hope you still have a lovely day though: 1
 Sorry hon its shitty i realized that right now and i feel really bad. 1000 times sorry and yes you will get alot of pictures.: 1
 Thanks for trying to see things from my perspective 😊: 1
 That's amazing: 1
 That one came out of nowhere: 1
 Its really crazy and alot of belgium / Netherlands also here so mabye we go here together at some point: 1
 Not surprised by that at all: 1
 Yeah no definitely not: 1
 Yeah same also of Norway in general its f.cking beautiful and the memories the god damm memories. So many nice memories from the time there and A beautiful person to remind me of them 😘: 1
 Exactly, it was just so fucking good I really can't wait to go back to Norway at some point. It won't be the same but hopefully when you come along, it would be great 😘 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 What are you up to tonight? More server stuff or playing games?: 1
 Nothing jet to be honest. Thought of watching a movie: 1
 No any ideas?: 1
 Could always watch one of the movies on the list?: 1
 Belive you just weird: 1
 Yeah i will see but is that  for us or what i could watch?: 1
 We could watch together if you want to but we don't have to: 1
 Sure but i will probably fall asleep half way through 😅: 1
 (definitely not speaking from experience): 1
 At what time?: 1
 What works for you?: 1
 Now till dawn i dont care: 1
 "till dawn" sure hon: 1
 We can start watching now if you want: 1
 Okay it took me way too long to eat: 1
 Eh, depends on what you made I guess: 1
 Love you 💜 goodnight and sweet dreams 😘: 1
 Had a weird dream last night but overall slept pretty well. How was your night?: 1
 Good morning sugar. Slept way too long and had a okayish night: 1
 Damm yeah get that feeling  parents sometimes dont ask its hard: 1
 Nice excited for itb: 1
 Yeah we can also make it together  if you wanna too: 1
 Sure, if you'd prefer that. Btw, you wanted to know what kind of laptop I have right?: 1
 Potatoes with egg and paprika?: 1
 It's a Dell Latitude 5530: 1
 Okay, hope so too: 1
 But I can run pretty heavy video editing software so it should be fine yeah: 1
 (at least I think that somehow correlates): 1
 yeah it does and nice: 1
 Not doing it now, but I used to for a project for school: 1
 I used DaVinci Resolve, great program if you're looking for a free editing software btw: 1
 We were part of a tv show or something with a bunch of other people and had to perform a dance performance where you were stuck together with your partner. Some other girls didn't know we were together so they tried to set me up with a macho guy which I didn't like, but then when it was time for pictures I was asking you to stand with me and you wouldn't so I thought you were embarrassed to be with me and I said "well if you don't want to be seen with me I will just go to that guy they were trying to set me up with" but then we made up and also did the dance together. And then everyone fell asleep and I woke up (still in the dream) feeling guilty for manipulating you like that because now you were being standoffish: 1
 Your still sick or is it gone after the meh night of sleep?: 1
 Going alright, I feel better than this morning and definitely better than yesterday so I'll be able to go to class tomorrow for sure: 1
 Thats good to hear 🙏🏼: 1
 Worked on the business stuff like website and some software atuff. Else  nothing much.: 1
 Oh yeah and talk with marco and Elias abit. With Marco mostly about the sky trip: 1
 Okay but that interaction was really cute: 1
 And honestly you could be talking about parts for your arcade machine that I've never heard about and I'd still more than gladly listen to your voice: 1
 Random stories from your life are always appreciated: 1
 I see well mabye i will try that one out too: 1
 Just be careful where you put them, they're really easy to push over 😅: 1
 Oh, sounds interesting, I have something against zoos on a principle but I wouldn't mind going to one: 1

 It was a really weird dance, I was carrying you around in a backpack: 1
 You were weighing nothing too, the whole time I was thinking you should eat more 😭: 1
 Update, I feel worse than yesterday and probably will have to throw up... I thought I was better the fuck: 1
 Damm hope you get through it 🙏🏼: 1
 I think being nauseous was mostly because I was hungry: 1
 Yeah but i man you can think when you ladt at and see if it makes sense then: 1
 It better not be the case, I'd be very annoyed <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Gotta love my prof telling us explicitly that tax evasion is not tax fraud and what we can actually still do legally: 1

 No matter, I would still consider it cheating for myself to kiss anyone other than you: 1
 Yeah same no thoughts about that. Would still ask in any way or except to be ask: 1
 Also for the record, just because it happened in my dream does not mean I have any intention to do anything like it in real life btw. The only lips I want to kiss are yours: 1

 He gets his happy ending: 1
 Well, will have to wait for that I'm afraid: 1
 Damn, that's a nice costume, and you look very cute too 😘: 1
 Mostly because I love the cinematography, it's really well done how they play with sound and colours and camera angles: 1
 Oh yeah, and Lars also sent me a message today: 1
 Because he talked to Jinte yesterday and the topic happened to involve me: 1
 And Laeticia actually broke up with her bf yesterday. He's an ass and I despise him: 1
 Ah okay so the straight topic i thought it was a other topic and he just texted you again 😅: 1
 I mean, I've known the guy since I was 3, and he doesn't send me anything after he doesn't read my messages and gets mad at me for not communicating with him? Not my fault, still slightly annoyed because he still didn't apologise but he texted me saying we should meet up: 1
 Idk, we'll see I guess: 1
 Really wish I could hug you: 1
 Btw, the German word for clumsy being "tollpatschig" sounds like a punishment for anyone having to explain they're simply clumsy: 1

 Do have to say, Belgium looks weirdly unorganised after Eastern Germany and the apartment blocks everywhere: 1
 Crazy would say so: 1
 Wouldn't: 1
 Not in a bad way, of course, just interesting how Belgium really is a lot more eclectic: 1
 Damnnnn, sounds good! Let's hope the food stays good for the rest of the semester then 🙏: 1

 Remember the guy I told you about that I got kicked out of the discord but then he was added to the Instagram group chat?: 1

 They both announced it in the group chat: 1
 But whyyy is it a mix of the French and English pronunciation 😭: 1
 What was it: 1
 Quietscheentschen ist also okay but not widely used: 1
 Although I also have no clue who I would talk to about rubber ducks in German: 1
 Maybe Jinte: 1
 My grandparents collect some when i was smaller: 1

 You're up way too early again? 😘: 1
 Thank God it works: 1
 Some people are such fucking weirdoes: 1
 Well yeah probably then: 1
 I walked away: 1
 It really does pay off knowing more German to understand the fucking station announcements: 1
 Just being able to understand all the languages they speak on the train is great, I can hear everything 4 times and still doubt if I heard it right 😅: 1
 That's skill 😅. But nice to hear you understand more and more: 1

 True, but I just really feel for his gf because she was totally blindsided by his decision: 1
 Yeah well cant really either but it could be a on off think until the move together mabye ?: 1
 or a shitty romance movie from the 2000ths: 1
 And from what I know about them, moving together isn't happening anytime soon: 1
 Okay yeah makes it way harder and unlikly in my opinion: 1
 I guess, idk, it's just a shitty situation: 1

 Nice cant wait: 1
 Okay will get that: 1
 I hate it so much goddamn... At least we can cuddle though 😅❤️: 1
 It was mostly to do with the fact that I'm kind of studying something in the direction of working corporate so what is the point in me studying this if it isn't what I want to do for a job. But I don't know what I want to do so it's stupid: 1
 Yeah sorry we will see i geuss will bring them to the meet up on Wednesday or mabye eat the befor if i am hingry enough: 1

 Good luck with that, hope it goes smoothly: 1
 Okay you wanna talk about it or just thinking for yourself at first: 1

 Yeah sure no worries: 1
 Bit later 😅 I need to eat food: 1
 Good luck at school 🍀: 1
 Alright, procrastinating a bit too much but I'll manage: 1
 In class right now but its programming so a bit boring: 1
 You already know everything?: 1
 Introduced mostly: 1
 I also saw you have maths this semester?: 1
 Ah right, you never know before the semester... Still so weird: 1
 Well i need to write them a mail to check: 1
 Oh, Okay 😅 cutie ❤️: 1
 We will probably stay at my parents house for the day you get here: 1
 Nope, gonna follow class online and work on a group project at the same time 😅: 1
 Not like you organised everything: 1
 Would sound really funny probably: 1
 Laughing at me again I see: 1

 Not like you could have easily said no though: 1
 Btw, should I bring a present for your family then? I still don't know what the deal with Easter is 😅: 1
 And what is normal to do in your family?: 1
 Nothing over 20 euro or so: 1
 Okay, why do you need to chip in though? (I'm just curious. I don't know, we don't do presents 😭): 1

 I hope you do too: 1
 I fucking hate people: 1
 Same but why?: 1
 I had a meeting with the other groupwork now normally, but someone pointed out that would be useless because we need to do some individual work first: 1
 Nobody is really normal thought: 1
 How is your day looking today?: 1
 Do you have anything to do right now?: 1
 Damm thats rare isn't it?: 1
 My mom just left and he thought he was alone and he was yelling for someone 😭: 1
 Sucks though: 1
 Did you eat your soup?: 1
 Insanity: 1
 Yes 100% crazy. But some people are like that: 1
 The engagement was really cute and original though: 1
 Apparently she really likes Coca cola, so her gf made a label with "will you marry me" and attached the ring to it, put it on the bottle and then on the table, and also decorated the house: 1
 Sounds nice but also as a normal not involved person mabye a bit weird with cola and all: 1
 So I then ask if we can move it, 1 person reads it and no one responds to that: 1
 Damm sucks hope she gets healthy soon or its not so bad: 1
 Poor her sorry: 1
 Ah, yeah, that makes more sense: 1
 Oh, and my dad drove over his laptop: 1
 With his car: 1
 It's a great day today: 1
 What how damm fuck <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Aren't there a lot of data on there: 1
 He put his bag down, then thought he would put the car inside but forgot about his bag that was still there, drove over it, felt like it was weird, backed off (so drove over it again) and then found out: 1
 Surprisingly the screen is broken but otherwise it still works: 1
 I do know I don't have my mom's drinking genes though, which in itself is an interesting discovery: 1
 Gonna have some drinks and hang out in Celine's dorm: 1
 Well yeah, glad your day was nice even if exhausting 😘: 1
 Will see, Celine has to take pictures anyway: 1
 Any chance I can get a picture back? 🥺: 1
 Please go to sleep: 1
 Aperol spritz was not good at first but now it's okay: 1
 And I may be tipsy: 1
 But only just feeling it now: 1
 It's a weird feeling: 1
 Got home, going to sleep now: 1
 I might not have been tipsy, but switching my glasses and the strobe lights sure made it feel that way: 1
 22: 1
 Glad you had a great night 😘.: 1
 Good morning by the way 😘: 1
 Hello sunshine how was your night?: 1

 Sounds nice, when'd you go to sleep though?: 1
 Okay and the steps: 1
 Xtc?: 1
 So I have no fucking clue what is going on: 1
 How difficult is it to answer a damn text?: 1

 Once again was shit but okay: 1
 Good morning I guess ☀️: 1
 I just want to say that the goodnight messages are really important to me. I don't know how you feel about them honestly because you seem to forget them quite regularly, but when you go out and I don't hear from you, and I wake up in the middle of the night not seeing something I get worried about you: 1
 Okay, I'll wait out front then. Maybe I'll go to the bathroom first though: 1
 Yeah get that. I will try to send it more. But also my phone dying when i am out doesn't help.: 1
 That's fair, I just want to know you're okay, that's all: 1
 I shall live: 1
 Oh, and about Aeneas dating, I don't know a lot, but Jingwen said he met her about 2 weeks ago during one of the French/English learning moments and she plays DnD. So he invited her to play it. Apparently she's an exchange student who wants to stay in Lille or something?: 1
 How is your day going my love?: 1
 Fully agree, today is too much for some reason, can't wait for tonight either 😘: 1
 You got it hon 🧡: 1

 Yeah my night was okay. I did feel abit tired when i woke up so went back to bed but now i feel great🥰: 1
 Happy to hear that 😊: 1
 Abit weird to say it in that way. You can do it would also help: 1
 Feeling tried don't know why. Alex has too much energy for me but all good. Else doing so chores and sending out applications: 1
 I'd rather have him be straightforward and tell me it's not gonna be easy, but fair point for motivational sake: 1
 Aw, damn, hope you get some extra energy then. Have you had lunch yet? Also hope they answer your applications soon: 1
 Eat some fruit or something still: 1

 Oh, that's nice: 1
 You're always tired of me 🥲 I just want to spend more time together 🥲 your sleep cycle is a bitch: 1
 Yes to the cycle: 1
 Was actually thinking I was wrong, you are your sleep cycle's bitch (no offence): 1
 Cause I don't want you to feel like shit: 1
 This it hurts to hurt each other and it sucks: 1
 I never want to hurt you: 1
 How was the talk with the others?: 1
 I don't know why we would: 1
 And sometimes we hurt each other because we're hurting ourselves too: 1
 I don't know what to say. Except i love you and i am sorry for hurting you today. Should i move Date night if i am feeling bot well? Or should i fall asleep with you?: 1
 *Unwell: 1
 Honey, you're tired, we shouldn't be talking about this now: 1
 Okay but then let's talk about it tomorrow please 🙏🏼: 1
 Talking about things is what makes this work: 1
 Obviously I love you too muffin 💜: 1
 I never feel this way when we're actually together you know? That's the part that fucks me up the most: 1
 It's the same for me.: 1
 Went for a drink with Cato and my parents after the play, was nice too, then drove Cato home and now I'm getting ready for bed: 1
 Still sucks though, they were practically living together and it was her first ever relationship: 1
 That has got to hurt: 1
 By the way didn't have a onion but added garlic: 1
 That's good too! It's just for flavour anyway, as long as you like it that's all that matters 😘: 1
 Looks good, I hope it tastes good too 😋😘: 1
 That has not happened before: 1
 Last episode of young royals: 1
 Nice mabye we will see: 1
 PLease: 1
 WHat the FUCK does that mean: 1
 I have 84GB left this is bullshit: 1
 Good thing for her to break it off: 1
 I may or may not be very frustrated with this project: 1
 No not in that sense its about the head of your data set and the lenght of it: 1
 or you look at the weka faq: 1
 Computer restart is possible if I have to I guess: 1
 I am just stupid: 1
 But thank you hon, your support is keeping me sane 😘: 1
 Nice restart helped?: 1
 I chose the wrong class: 1
 Which shut down the whole program: 1
 Which is stupid: 1
 Sorry just went shopping with my mom and i am dead tired ngl.: 1
 Oh yeah in that way yeah: 1
 Your on you way to class?: 1
 Any other ideas?: 1
 _writing that down_: 1
 Like i eat it no worries bit would make it my self: 1
 Love you hon 🧡: 1
 Still, I would rather make you things you actually like: 1
 And I'm looking through my books for other ideas 😅: 1
 You basically roast the potatoes and paprika in the oven and bake an egg with it: 1
 Oh, and some cherry tomatoes! They also go in the oven but a bit later: 1
 No, you just bake that one in a pan: 1
 But it works so I will stop being annoyed about it now: 1
 Btw, yelling "cool bike" at a motorcyclist is really fun 😁 did it last week and the guy revved his bike 😁😎: 1
 Yeah can image that i mean "random" nice thinks are allways great. Probably made his day: 1
 Yeah, that's true, giving random compliments always feels nice too, people are always so pleasantly surprised: 1
 No, he is actually: 1
 But it's a complicated situation: 1
 Should i cook the potatoes befor putting it in the oven?: 1
 If you cut them small enough you can just put them in the oven, but don't forget to add some olive oil or something alike when you do, and you can add salt and pepper before too: 1
 Just comes down on everytime something doesn't go the way he wants, he shuts her out, blames it on someone else and uses his diagnoses as excuses. She can't handle it anymore, especially after she was being hit on continuously by a guy, called him about it and he told her that she chose to go there so she can deal with it herself: 1
 Yuppp, never met the guy but he sounds terrible: 1
 He also got mad at her because her mom had to at surgery last week and she was taking care of her. For that reason she couldn't go over on Thursday and bring food with her, so he got mad saying things like "what am I going to eat then? I don't have money to buy food" because he spent it on one of his hobbies... Like Jesus Christ he's a child: 1
 No clue what that means: 1
 The cheesecake made me want to bake something too: 1
 Well it didn't show on the homescreen. I am sorry hon 😘: 1
 Nice how were they?: 1
 Any clue why they didn't show up on the home screen?: 1
 They were good, my parents ate about half of them: 1
 Yeah really annoying to ve honest: 1
 Be: 1
 Hope class is going well: 1
 Omw back home now: 1
 10 min: 1
 Alex: 1
 Happy to hear you finally remembered the existence of the app: 1
 I looked at alex: 1
 My Alex: 1
 Yeah no shit your Alex but still don't know what that means: 1
 What's up: 1
 Took a nap: 1
 This late?: 1
 Isn't that just pre-sleep?: 1
 Should do some uni stuff but will sleep probably instead: 1
 Yes i have: 1
 I know, I saw the schedule: 1
 Just worrying about my classes, what I'm going to do next year, all that. And just woke up every couple of hours: 1

 Goodnight hon 💜 hope to see you in my dreams 😘😴: 1

 Damn that's smooth: 1
 We watch the 5 so 6. Yeah but i am not really watching to be honest 😅: 1
 We packed everything and we're already on our way to Oslo, we're taking the ferry tomorrow so we're staying in a hotel tonight. I said bye to the guys this morning : 1

 No electricity for at least the next couple of hours 😅🥲: 1

 Oh, okay!: 1
 In Dresden: 1
 I'll have to see which books I haven't read yet, probably a bunch. Once I've made a decision I'll let you know 😘: 1
 Still can't believe my parents haven't said anything about that despite finding my pants in the couch when they got back 😅: 1
 Looks interesting any idea whats it about: 1
 And with DnD not happening I thought maybe tomorrow would work, but idk if you already made other plans or not: 1
 Almost finished though, probably will be finished tonight: 1
 I somehow probably found the only Belgian chocolate in this store with German translation on the packaging... And I didn't even do it intentionally: 1
 Quite nice, I generally enjoy them, why do you ask?: 1
 But probably the pain/being completely vulnerable thing?: 1
 I also found the arms: 1

 Köln and Hannover instead: 1
 Okay sounds great ❤️: 1
 Hope your night was good 😊: 1
 If your still up?: 1
 Eh... It seems to be a tie so far: 1
 Yup, it's definitely crazy for me because this is kind of the same thing she said when we spoke last which is almost a year ago? So the fact nothing has really changed is crazy: 1
 Gosh, I feel like one of those typical teenage girls from movies that talk to their crush laying on their bed, on their stomach with the feet in the air, you know what I mean?: 1
 Dancing together!: 1
 Kind of finished an assignment, but need to fix it up a bit, so okayish, the other assignment is way bigger though 🥲 definitely not gonna finish that today: 1
 Gone text you later driving now: 1
 Your a big girl now and can do what you want.: 1
 The train is 8 minutes late: 1

 You make me curious about what the goal is now: 1
 You're there already?: 1

 On laptop I am the Flash: 1
 yeah hope you wont be to hungry until then: 1
 I should have helped you clean up the kitchen, sorry 😅: 1
 Yeah have seen it she is really intelligent and has a great potcast: 1
 Also if you want to reheat the potatoes you can just add the paprika's and maybe a little bit of milk when you hear it up to make sure it doesn't dry out: 1
 Hahah, yeah, I'm on my phone so I see the notifications instantly 😂: 1
 I get that 100%. When I was with my cousin yesterday I felt a bit down before we met up and I was talking about our trip and I was suddenly so much happier just thinking of you and talking about you 😅: 1
 Yeah you were the inspiration: 1
 Nice any info on your next train?: 1
 Going alright, baked pancakes with Laura, was nice: 1
 Better be quit 🤫 then hope they can sleep abit longer: 1
 Yeah, my mom will probably end up doing the accounting for it 😂: 1
 Well yeah i only take good pictures with you and well you look really fucking good: 1
 Hope they still tasted good: 1
 I know I know, but Alex asked to set up a new date and she seems to be trying to avoid it idk? It's kinda weird, I'm not saying it's in purpose but Alex clarified and there still wasn't really a good response: 1
 Good morning my love hope you had a great night as well. Nothing much hanging out with Alex & Fabian. Else not that much planned. What's your plan for today? I know Laura is coming over and you go to a concert right?: 1
 Aeneas has never seen them apparently: 1
 Just for you: 1
 Okayish did some university stuff watching now a episode of wrexham. I will go to the store after that: 1

 Aww that's cute but also worried 🥺: 1
 I'm gonna cry: 1
 Mabye the other one will wait: 1
 At least 10 minutes late... I swear to fucking god: 1

 Well hope the train waits. When should you be in Köln?: 1

 Going to my parents house now. How is your day going so far? Any plans for today?: 1
 Ohhh, okay I guess, makes sense I suppose: 1

 Next stop is Leipzig 🥰: 1
 <3: 1
 Hope you het your beautiful ass to bed now or what's your plan?: 1
 Yeah same thought. I hope he finds something and they can get to know each other better 🤞: 1
 Maybe I can wait outside so we don't have to go in the parking: 1
 What why?: 1
 Then again... Just a bit more than 2 weeks 😁🥲: 1
 At a bar in Ghent. Will also apply for a museum souvenir shop later: 1

 I never knew, but apparently the company that makes it is from Gent??: 1
 I am sorry i am retarded: 1
 I haven't seen a "fight like this in a while: 1
 You making me tear up a bit you know: 1
 A few cm would be a lot already 😭: 1
 I don't know, I'm just laying awake thinking about it because someone made a comment about long distance relationships interfering with life and changing how you do things and that it might not be very healthy or improving life quality and I don't know how to deal with it very well.: 1
 I love you so much I'd break my own heart if it would be better for you, and I am not sure that's a good thing: 1
 Your cutely aggressive 😘: 1
 Yeah great memory was one of the best night in Norway night.: 1
 Just someone I know who was also in a long distance relationship (I honestly know way too many people like that Jesus Christ) but it didn't turn out well unfortunately: 1
 What are your plans for today? Still relaxing from your walk from yesterday?: 1
 How old were they and i think we are different: 1
 Now can we end today on a bit of a happier note? I don't want to keep you up too long but I also don't want to go when just talking about this: 1
 It's in the south part, where we won't be, but still: 1
 You're sweet and kind and loving and caring and shit, so many good things: 1
 But that's just a thing in general, doesn't only have to be poetry, I like listening to you: 1
 I'm gonna drive home now that's why I had to say goodbye 😅: 1
 I wouldn't change a thing, I honestly quite like how we got together, even if it could have happened sooner 😘: 1
 Your cute and now please try to sleep because you have work do tomorrow. I will also try to sleep now: 1

 Everyone is gone, I love them but goddamn, I was done the last half hour 😅, kind of surprised they're already gone though, would have expected them to stay longer: 1
 Its the new year's calendar.: 1
 Not yet probably will do that tonight: 1
 My night was pretty nice  even though i slept with clothe again. But you have a free day? Gone work on your BAP?: 1

 What's up for today?: 1
 Oh, and Pieter just said my life is pathetic because I don't know how long his bag of tea is supposed to be in the water 😂: 1
 I'm kind of debating on trying to get him into MTG, I think he would be susceptible other than the fact that it costs a lot of money: 1
 Almost home 😊: 1
 "he would be susceptible" is a interesting way of saying he might like it 😅: 1
 I think he would mainly like how organised and clean it can be: 1
 Sounds good, maybe we can call tomorrow? Let me know, I'm gonna fall asleep now 😴 so probably won't see the response 😅: 1
 I like more a 2000/90 mix <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Yeahhh... makes sense, but then again having the schedule in the first week of classes already is also pretty damn insane 😅: 1
 I feel like saying good morning is pretty common here, but saying goodbye is a bit more difficult because you get out from the back so you don't see the driver again: 1
 The train to Hannover leaves at 8: 1
 I guess 😅: 1
 The postman was like eh german iis german: 1
 Oh yeah, I also got the privilege to Watch a recently divorced lesbian seduce 2 men (very successful might I say). Very entertaining. It is also very interesting to note that this is one of Jinte's mom's best friends and we were hanging out with them at a bar at this point: 1
 How's camping?: 1

 what's for dinner?: 1
 Nice to hear 🥰. Still thinking about baking something befor the kitchen is unusable anymore? Going to play cards with everyone now and washing up is sometimes really nice to meet new people 😅: 1
 Hmm, shouldn't you be there too though?  I mean, not that I want to keep you away but the business thing sounds pretty important if it's the thing that was rescheduled from today to tomorrow: 1

 The lights are very nice: 1

 He did some stupid things, drank way too much, then we wanted to get a drink for him so left him in the car for 5 minutes but accidentally got on a train and forgot where we left the car. We immediately tried to get back though!: 1
 I tried, let's put it that way 😅: 1

 Good morning love, hope you had a good night. I dreamt we were on a trip with Anthony, got him knocked out somehow and then he was stuck in a car on a hot summer day and we had to find a way to get him out 😅: 1
 Oof, well, seeing your grandparents could be nice but I hope it's not too tiring: 1
 Hmm... I mean, I really do like the movie but I'm not sure it is my favourite of all time anymore... I honestly don't really have an answer for this one... Though I do also love Les Choristes, but it's been too long since I last saw it... It's too hard to pick!: 1
 Just hope you get your good hours of sleep: 1
 Tonight?: 1
 I miss you too 🥺: 1
 Now at the first aid course, Alex bought a big as book and both of us are stressing out: 1
 I'm gonna look up if Valintain is a medication or not because it looks like one to me 😜: 1
 Thank you, I hope you do too ❤️: 1
 Okay, will do ❤️: 1
 Nevermind, I think she misread her own ticket, she's pretty blind: 1
 Come on love, you can do it 😘 get something done so you can be proud of yourself tonight ❤️: 1
 Goodnight muffin 💜🧁: 1
 Good morning love, hope you have a productive day 😘: 1
 It's so weird when you wake up and nobody is home: 1
 Yeah hope you have a good night too and sleep well if you go to bed now? (dnd Was awesome 🤗: 1
 Nice tell me everything after the cat Cafe. I will talk with him tomorrow too: 1
 If I did not have the video of the cat, I would 100% think it was a dream: 1
 You have to do the same though 😘: 1
 Didn't hurt myself so far, no promises for the rest of today though 😅: 1
 Yeah I wish you had: 1
 love to hear your voice too: 1
 Apparently they found the owners so the cat is back there now: 1
 Hmm... Sure, but I think we both know simply reading books is much more fun: 1
 Okay, just gotta throw out the garbage, mop the floors and maybe dust a bit: 1
 My day's going well, drove the car and now we're on a small hike, it's very beautiful 😊: 1
 Goodnight my favorite rabbit in the world 😘🐇❤️: 1

 Going great to be honest after your text I got some motivation and be on it for 1: 1
 Yeah I am back to studying and talking with my mom what we should make for dinner: 1
 … honey, you had 5 hours of sleep max, you better make it want that: 1
 And it kinda frustrates me that sometimes I feel too 'desperate' or needy: 1
 Yeah, honestly though that's literally the biggest fuck up I could imagine you making and it's not even that bad, would be annoying but manageable: 1
 You are not 'desperate' /need. I got the same feeling. I also have no idea how to deal with it.: 1
 I am very curious to see what it will look like when it's actually finished then, you're giving me high expectations you know?: 1
 I love you so much, but it hurts so much too.: 1
 For Paris?: 1
 It's like I always miss you more when I know I'll see you soon...: 1
 I'd love to just see you in real life, I'd be absolutely delighted to touch you: 1
 Talk tomorrow?: 1
 Yeahhhh... I kinda hope so because otherwise it would be sad with the amount of work and time we put into this 😅: 1
 Same for me and your a real cutie: 1
 You've been doing a lot of sports and then socialising + drinking could definitely make you really tired: 1
 I'd say so yeah, sometimes I feel like you know me better than I know you, but I want to know everything: 1
 And apparently there is a new pancake restaurant in Ghent which looks crazy and great so I want to try it out with you 😊: 1
 Okay it is really unclear damn: 1
 Need to think about that one for a sec. Yeah you will never get rid of that one 🥲: 1
 Yes but making new friends in your 20s is harder: 1
 Yeah got something similar in German: 1
 No??: 1

 Okay nevermind: 1
 Slept quite good as well : 1
 Happy birthday to the person I love with all my heart ❤️🥳: 1

 First I have to do a pitch to the teacher, then Laeticia is coming over, then I'm introducing Laeticia to Alex, then I have a class, and then I am going out for dinner with Celine and Julia (and perhaps some of her friends idk): 1
 Oh how I wish I could hug you right now: 1
 Loved the picture ❤️: 1
 While she was telling me 2 days ago she was kind of scared of being intimate again after her ex: 1
 Hope you have a good night if you go to sleep soon 😘: 1
 Dude almost got me an internship too: 1
 Who allowed you to look so attractive and be so far away? Absolutely unfair: 1
 Tell me when your nap is over.: 1
 Okay, hope you had/have a great night 😘 : 1
 Wanna call tomorrow after lunch or some other time? Or in the evening?: 1
 Okay, but just so know that always stands: 1

 Sucks but same to be honest 😅: 1

 What I said still counts, call me when you want ;): 1
 Yeah... kinda surprised me with it a bit: 1
 Family really is great ❤️: 1
 I won't and I would procrastinat anyways. I would rather procrastinat with you then with any think else in the world. You also help me to study with your text and when we call it also kinda helps.: 1

 Tell me i am curious: 1
 But I actually got a seat... With ease: 1
 Next week 🥰😘: 1
 Basically just that I should stop reading romance books in general because while I now finally understand them, they also make me feel lonely after I'm done with them. I used to really dislike romantic tropes and things like that because I never understood them or thought people acted too much on unreasonable feelings, but now it makes a lot more sense to me so I kinda like reading them more now.: 1
 Don't be sorry, I get to experience more now, it's not a bad thing persé: 1
 Okay so against it or for it or in what way?: 1
 We can talk about it on Thursday I guess: 1
 If you say so yourself: 1
 Gonna go to bed now, goodnight my love, hope you get a good night rest ❤: 1
 good job hon ❤️: 1
 Good to hear. Whats your planfor the day?: 1
 It's going alright, listening to rSlash now, Reddit stories: 1
 It looks pretty much exactly like before 😂: 1
 Yeah my night was great just tried now. At 7 some of our friends came over and we played some card games and drove to eat something.: 1
 Oh I expect you to keep me to those words gladly: 1
 Man, I can't think: 1
 It's apparently my mom's favourite part of accounting which she isn't allowed to do anymore, but I don't like it that much so far 😅: 1
 So I'm guessing you are not gonna get your grades today? Or does your professor just work at really weird hours?: 1
 No idea i need to ask the prof because there is still no date which is really weird: 1
 I get that, but I'll be annoyed on your behalf then : 1
 Miss you too so much and ita getting harder and harder not to just drive to Belgium at any minute 😶: 1
 Well I guess he got a similar vibe to him 😅: 1
 I'm just doing the last bits to leave tomorrow and then working a bit on the school project: 1
 How about the dc any new friends? Any other news?: 1

 I think it's crazy and absolutely unbelievable how I keep missing you more every single day: 1
 Why should there be high people at this conference: 1
 I would like to try that out: 1
 But when I think about it it makes sense. In such a short time you've become so important to me, I don't want to imagine my life without you anymore. You're one of my best friends and I'm so lucky to be your partner, I don't ever want to take you for granted. You have my full permission to fuck me up if I ever seem to take you for granted anyway. I can't wait to keep growing and see where we go in the future. Idk, just felt like getting this off my chest, I hope reading this starts your day off nicely 😘😊: 1
 Wrong button Sorry: 1
 Playing scribble with alex,fabian, patrick und danila: 1

 I just got home, how was/is your evening?: 1
 What are the plans for this week?: 1
 Hugs and i would suggest but kind hard over this distance 😐: 1

 I am also like... Really close to just taking a train and coming over but I don't want to disrupt you when you have a lot of things to do and I have things to do too (though not that important): 1
 I... Can very easily actually, but it just doesn't sound like actual cursing: 1
 If you tell me more about the ski trip otherwise 🤐: 1
 I also deleted the picture I sent you right after I sent it (on my own phone) because I got embarrassed 😅: 1
 I miss feeling your heat in my bed, our bodies next to each other, or on top, cuddling. Just simply undressing and getting to hug you, feel how warm (and hot) you are. Turning around to steal a kiss, getting distracted and doing a whole lot more than just a peck, then turning back around because now we "really should go to sleep". Waking up next to you in the morning and admiring your beauty first thing in the morning. I miss you: 1
 It's like school again photo day 😅. If they take a picture of you would you be so kind to send it to me 🥰: 1
 Just learning some more about docker and playing some games. I also need to pack my things for the weekend ☺️: 1
 I hope I will dream of you too 😘: 1

 That's a really good description: 1

 You never know the full story but it kinda sounds sketchy from her(not Alex ) side. Will see i geuss: 1
 Still don't do too many tiring things today: 1
 Idk, she says you don't eat a lot so now I don't either (but I already didn't eat that much anymore before I met you so it's complete bullshit): 1
 Probably not gonna do much fabian needs to go home soon and alex is probably going home too.: 1

 Okay so I eat to eat more got that. I will feed you when I am over 😅: 1
 I don't know, Cato isn't here yet: 1

 Pretty good, got a high five from my senior 😁 other than that nothing special: 1
 Just meh but I'm used to that: 1
 Turns out we talked with my parents and their friends until now: 1

 My day is okay, my professors are kind of wackjobs but it's interesting so far. Just wish the fucking bathroom wasn't broken though : 1
 Idk how to say it: 1
 And get back to you once I figure it out: 1
 We can also talk about it? Tomorrow or sometime on the weekend?: 1
 Tomorrow probably not, but Saturday evening or something?: 1
 Yeah sounds good to me ❤️: 1
 Okay i will take it like that but still wanna talk about it on the weekend: 1
 Allright kinda procrastinating again but its on the last few steps 😅: 1
 Either decide to stop procrastinating or decide to finish it tomorrow then: 1
 Good idea ❤️: 1

 Goodnight cute fox 🧡🦊: 1

 Yeah, figured that was the case: 1
 Very sad: 1
 Hope you have a great day today 😘: 1

 Capitalism 🙃🙄: 1
 yeah even though the battery kinda fucked it abit: 1
 I want to hug you so badly: 1
 Allright nothing crazy abit boring to be honest 😅: 1
 I love you, I'm just never sure how to express it in the right way if that makes sense. Or well, what the way would be that resonates the best with you. So I try to do it in all the ways I can think of, but I think I still don't know which is the best: 1
 Spring time comes around everybody is getting happy: 1
 Yeah getting there i geuss 😐: 1
 Oh okay nevermind think about me cutie ❤️: 1
 Good job working on it though, even more so when you hate it ❤: 1
 Yeah, but gonna go for dinner with Jinte at 18: 1
 Yeah, might go home during the break, I already have a headache so probably not a bad idea anyway: 1
 Never thought bad about you: 1
 Prof sees you and is like them nobody is prepared: 1
 Prof is way too late: 1
 He doesn't see anything: 1
 Prof just came in: 1
 I'm not looking forward to this 🥲: 1

 At home yes, but my parents are gone already: 1
 Okay your going to the other party by the way?: 1
 Oh right they are flying to day. Mabye just leave abit early?: 1
 I'm okay, feeling good physically, just kinda not nice to use my arm: 1
 Feels like the blood is praying out when I put too much force, but obviously that's not the case, it's just weird 🥲: 1
 Ah okay sounds weird could be a mental thing. But doesn't sounds that bad but hope it goes away fast still 🙏🏼: 1
 busy boy: 1
 I hate changing the sheets: 1
 Hope you have a great night hon 🧡 & say hi to jinte for me <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 (will let you know when we get home): 1
 The place is quite a health hazard though, pretty sure there's a bunch of black mould on the walls 😅: 1
 I see why Jinte likes it so much though, it's really cool: 1
 Nice to hear. Would love to see it at some point.: 1
 Ah okay and you then stop. You know why the attack?: 1
 You got it and jintes is there 😅: 1
 Tell me how it went: 1
 Still alive: 1
 Had a panic attack: 1
 That's rude, I want it to be asocial 🥲: 1
 But if my teacher is a lot later I'm just leaving: 1
 I am feeling okay, Jinte went first and wasn't feeling well which stressed me out more than expected: 1
 Well I'm already here and it was closer to my class than to home so idk: 1
 We weren't planning that though. I actually went first but the examination to check if I could give blood took longet: 1
 *longer: 1
 And then halfway through my donation I started panicking: 1
 But we can call anytime?: 1
 They stopped the donation really quickly and gave me a bag to breathe in (which is kinda weird): 1
 Probably combo of already being nervous, Jinte not doing good and then just idk: 1
 Yeah makes sense but you still did it . Proud of you ❤️: 1
 I guess, not sure I'll do it again anytime soon though 😅: 1
 Finish the assigment mostly and doing some chores: 1
 Any other plans than jinte meet up for today ?: 1
 Nah, but that will take all of tonight so there's really no other time for anything else 😅: 1
 Especially if it turns out that the class is running until 16: 1
 Meeting up with Jinte and her fam at 18: 1
 Ah okay sucks overall but hope you can still relax abit more later before jinte comes over: 1
 Oh, nice! Then still one to Gößnitz?: 1
 I pray to all the gods: 1
 Now in Brüssel getting on to the next train: 1
 "Brüssel" 😂: 1
 Love it: 1
 Greetings from marco by the way: 1
 Oh cool!: 1

 How is your day going so far hon 🧡: 1
 Ahh, hope it works out better tomorrow then: 1

 Good ideas 😘: 1
 Damn, lucky you still got the trains though! But delays always suck 🥲: 1
 Yes now in the kids section of the train: 1
 Ahhhh, fun 😂: 1
 Phone dead: 1
 Ooohhh, yeah, that's because they go to France: 1
 Its smells horrible and they are all eating weird food: 1
 No I know that, but it goes to France and most trains that operate within France you have to show your ticket before entering: 1
 Remember when we went to Paris? In Lille we also had to scan our ticket before entering the train: 1
 Long distance is always like that: 1
 In France: 1
 Did you bring enough food and drinks for the trip?: 1
 Hello??: 1
 Or when I do it's hard to put it in words: 1
 Where the fuck are you: 1
 In lede: 1
 Its pretty chill but smells kinda like shit: 1
 It makes no sense: 1
 Lede?: 1
 You took the wrong train: 1
 Got the samw feeling thought: 1
 My messages takes forever to be send out 😤: 1
 No crying in the car 🥳: 1
 He just came back inside: 1

 What movies are you watching? Sounds fun and relaxing! I took a couple of pictures but my camera is awful, I'll send you a couple when I get the pictures my family took: 1
 Yeah feel the same. Its like you need to survive and its nice to have. But its also so irrelevant and such a "bad" topic/thing. Likr its boring and its just a think/construct: 1
 One of the first things he said "it's totally fine if you're drunk in my class, but maybe don't take ketamine, because I heard on the radio this morning it's not good and it's for horses, and I think you would be quite offended if I called you a horse": 1
 Guess who's gonna go watch Barbie for the third time?: 1
 Oh, okay, yeah no we're pretty okay with how things are going right now, just a little limited in the options where we're at right now, that's all. I can't exactly explain everything we've planned to you to show how we've thought it out either 😅: 1

 I will be there at 14: 1
 Capitalist pigs: 1
 That's good, I'm glad: 1
 Still don't really understand that take but okay. Guess that's what happens when you grow up tracking planes of your family when they go on vacation. I'd say it's stalking if I knew exactly where you were the whole time, but I don't? Anyway, doesn't matter, I just don't get it: 1
 Oh: 1
 Before I forget: 1
 Made a couple of plans for the week: 1

 I see it is your goal to make me shy today: 1
 Yuppp, my mom was the one who said something about that indeed. Especially because I think last time she called she asked something like "so there's really no one interesting around there?" And I was like "Nahhh... Not really" ... What a lie 🥲: 1

 Adult children 😭: 1
 Hmm... Interesting... Probably my friend getting together with her ex... While I think she did mature through the relationship, it definitely hurt her a lot as well and I want to protect her from that. However, I also don't want to control what she does so I never said anything against it as long as I wasn't aware of the hurt it brought her.: 1
 Sweet dreams my love ❤️: 1

 Well yeah you weren't there for 5 days at some point you need to. Go back 😅. Which song are you dancing now?: 1
 We made up no worries, though my dad would never admit it when he's wrong... (Now we're on to the next argument, though I'm not involved now, it's about the renovations again 😅) (none of the arguments are really serious though, it's all just slight annoyances): 1
 This time he didn't do it for so long 5/10 mins. What are you up to now?: 1
 I am genuinely so absolutely grateful and thankful and all the good things in the world for meeting you last year. I don't even want to imagine a life without you.

 Anthony is still sick, but I think he is slowly getting better. They're taking a plane tomorrow... They didn't really say much about how they were feeling, other than Jingwen saying he really doesn't want to go back either. I think mentally all of them were doing alright, but I'm planning on sending them a message sometime tomorrow to remind them that they can always call. My dad also invited them to Ghent so we'll definitely be seeing them sometime in the next year.: 1
 Damn, long work day, how you feeling hon?: 1
 Oh, that's too bad! Hope it was still nice: 1
 Andddd... They are calling off pickpockets again... Gotta love Frankfurt and Brussels: 1

 Nice good luck studying then and say hi to alex for me: 1
 Went pretty well I think, didn't know what to expect from it though 😅: 1
 My friends told me that I just changed and that I am more grown up I think. Don't really know what they mean with that to be honest.: 1
 Eh... remains to be seen, but I think she'll be fine, I just have too high expectations I guess: 1
 Talking about happiness, turns out it only gets worse until 47 : 1
 At the party right now it's nice. I talk a lot with my aunt about France and Belgium. Nothing plan after 17: 1

 You can procrastination for 3 more hours 🥳: 1

 Okido, I'm gonna send him a message now, will see if he answers: 1
 It's probably too late for that if you have class in the morning yeah: 1
 Yeah was really nice. Felt like Aeneas and you didn't have much to talk about but I guess it's hard for the DM to juggle some may people.: 1
 Familial reasons: 1
 According to my family I changed a lot, kind of hard to tell though, it's just kinda weird: 1
 I would assume so yeah: 1
 Yeah it's about LaTeX it's a text mark up language. It's usefull but really hard to get into if not interesting: 1
 I'm in Brussels: 1
 Are you sure it's the 6th one?: 1
 How's the boardgame project going? That has to be done soon?: 1

 Busy but nice sounds like a good day to me: 1
 Also we had a question. Do you know what the signs with a big red dot and then an arrow underneath or 'ende' mean?: 1

 I'm very thankful yours still smells like you 😊🥰: 1
 Yeah I want to ask you? Or me and Alex got in a situation. Me and Alex went to pick up Killian friend of us after a party. Then we saw him and his first crush kiss and making out. Alex was really confused because Killian is the typ of person that does date or likes to start a relationship easily. Then Alex thought that Killian used the drunken State of the girl (Helena) and was disappointed in Killian. Then I said mabye there both drunk and just one think let to other. In the Ende we talk about at the party with out Killian and where really confused because Killian isn't the person to use somebody or get easily into a relationship. After we pick him up he explained that he ask her Multiple times if it was okay and that he has still feeling for her. But she also made out with someone else that night so we don't really know what to think of this situation it's weird.: 1
 You know, I just realised I dreamt you were gonna be here today... The fuck why does my brain fuck me over like this?: 1
 Well, 80-20 rule I guess 😂: 1
 Very clearly, nah, the guy saw my dad's name and assumed.: 1

 Man, it's weird, idk how to explain but there's just a bunch of annoying energy in my body (remnants of anxiety) that's stuck in my body and before you try to solve it for me by saying maybe doing something active would work, it doesn't I have tried: 1

 Turns out there have been 4 deaths within the families of my BAP group in just the last 2 weeks... This thing is fucking deadly: 1
 I don't really know what the story is about yet, still on the first page, but the main character is someone that was controlled throughout her whole life, and when she finally found some freedom she took advantage of that to break out of the control her family had on her. So I guess the main story will be seeing her show her family how she has outgrown the boundaries they put on her. If I ever manage to write that much 😅: 1
 Omw there: 1
 Welllll... yeah, happens 😅 at least they're (hopefully) not going into your room: 1

 *screaming audibly into my pillow*: 1
 How was/is class?: 1
 Yeah it was but he forgot about it really fast 😅: 1
 So yeah what are you up too still BAP shit?: 1
 Done with the stuff going to sleep now: 1
 You asked me to ask you about this?: 1
 Yeah sounds good 😘: 1
 I hope he finds it!: 1
 I feel that so much even Alex thinks about long distance relationship songs about us now: 1
 Well good luck hope she doesn't need to do them again. Have fun 😘: 1
 Sure, here are some movie recommendations from Netflix and Disney+: 1
 Yeah not really a fan but will see: 1
 *plans: 1
 I'm actually gonna go to sleep now though, with the hour change and everything, I wanna get a good night of sleep: 1
 No one has come to the classroom yet 😂: 1
 Hahaha, you thought it was at 20?? We can also call at 18: 1
 Anyway, I think I'm going to sleep: 1
 Goodnight hon ❤️ (trying to go to sleep but no promises): 1
 But you study in the library right? I think Friday is then maybe best? Idk what you think: 1
 Child does not know the way: 1
 Can get a nice sitting  place: 1
 Taking a day to rest? Probably a good idea. How do your muscles feel after skiing so much the last couple of days?: 1
 Anything would be nice if it's just with you 🥰: 1
 She is being judge?: 1
 Morning love, had an alright night, basically locked myself in my room because I thought there were french speaking people trying to break in 😅 (spoiler, they weren't): 1
 Get that, love you ❤️: 1
 I can't wait that long: 1
 Yeah you really can't your the chosen one: 1
 You wanna go into a zoo?: 1
 The hatred against the Dutch is in my blood but this man gets the blood from underneath my nails: 1
 Nice see you later 🥰: 1
 And you don't think that would have made me being distracted worse? When you're sitting right beside me and I can do anything I want without having to go 800km? Really hon? I had a lot of self restraint to actually study back then instead of trying to distract you with kisses the whole time: 1
 I miss you too, also can't wait for dnd, but also kinda afraid I'm gonna do a shit job at it 😅: 1
 Going home half an hour early because I can't deal with this shit anymore 🥲: 1
 Do you know if Anthony was also going to come or not?: 1
 Thanks love, I'm also happy I'd only have to do 2 years more, allows a lot more options for the future: 1
 God I feel useless here 😭: 1
 Right now apparently: 1
 okay so its over or not ?: 1
 But I will because I should eat and drink something, you're right: 1
 It's gonna be weird to sleep alone again tonight... I got used to having you around to cuddle with: 1
 *hear: 1
 Other than that I'm just sad/not as happy as I would usually be, but I should get better soon: 1
 Tonight at 20 right?: 1
 Sleep well my love 😘: 1
 Dnd haha: 1
 Same hon, 100% same 🥲: 1
 Hope the sunburn is in a okay spot: 1
 Okay, what do you want to do?: 1
 Got it: 1
 Impressive: 1
 I'm still in the store 😭: 1
 Scared to death to go sky diving though 😅: 1
 I also can not count the amount of times where Jinte threatened to kill Anthony: 1
 Yeah would love to: 1
 Hey what are u doing today? How were the fries yesterday?: 1
 Cutie and i get that feeling like everytime i think about you so i think a wallpaper with you being a lovely would also kill me: 1
 Hope you still had a good night of sleep hon 😘. You gonna go shopping with jinte today right? If you meet up with her say hi from me.: 1
 So far good, watched a movie and now I'm dreading going upstairs because it's Hella loud outside: 1
 Okay, at the bybanen in 20 mins or something?: 1
 The accent is fine, my 2 teachers both had _bad_ accents so I'm kinda used to it: 1
 This has nothing to do with you honestly. It's just that I don't find any satisfaction in thinking of being a director of any kind at whatever point in my life. I would rather work for a smaller company and have a good bond with my colleagues, get a smaller salary and things like that, than to work for a giant corporation and be stressed as fuck to go into work every day: 1
 Hope you have a good rest of the evening 😘: 1
 Good luck with not procrastinating then ;): 1
 Have a safe drive hon. I'm at mu grandparenst' now: 1
 Hope you had a great night or a weird as fuck nightmare? 😅🤭: 1
 How was your day today while you were sick? What did u do? Are u the only one in ur family that's sick? Hope u get better soon: 1
 At one point I woke up and the call was done so if that wasn't you I'm not sure what happened 😅: 1
 It does suck, but yeah, what can be done about it? Yeahhh... A bit of a task, but we're going for sushi for lunch so I get a reward 😁: 1
 I would rather work late then finish it another day. Because you need to get back in it.: 1
 Sounds like it's always a fun time when you're planning things ^^': 1
 Yeah we can do that sounds great: 1
 Yeahhh, next Monday we can grab lunch together 😘 (hopefully without Thibault) I guess I am really lucky so far indeed!: 1
 Let me know how it goes: 1
 Nothing much, chatting with Jinte about plants: 1
 yeah sounds good: 1
 Like is said, she did not sleep at all: 1
 Sorry hon cant distract you every time you work 🥰: 1
 Well not really because it doesn't work most of the time. Except if you need like if you are handy capt. Else they don't really give a shit: 1
 How much room is in his room?? I mean, I know his room is the biggest but where the fuck is there space for that??: 1
 Its okay hon i got it: 1
 Ahh... Boring 😅: 1
 How were trashy movies with Marco yesterday? And what are you up to today?: 1
 ps You are amazing ❤️ and i wanna give you a my love too: 1
 I dropped her off half an hour ago at home: 1
 I just finished work, going home with Laura and my aunt now, I'm tired 😴 (even if I didn't actually have to do much today): 1
 Okay, that's goof: 1
 They were also already gone before I woke up so yeah 😅: 1
 No clue, I didn't stick around after it happened: 1
 I don't know, anything is fine for me, I'm not hungry though: 1
 yeah, but ants are poisonous and can get to you everywhere: 1
 Just continuing to watch the series, nothing else planned (except our date of course 😘(if it's not too late 😅)): 1
 Yeah shity receptions sucks: 1
 Damn, the Belgian guy did just hit the highest set average in the competition though: 1
 Don't want to be the reason i'm distracted?: 1
 But I don't think he's up to date on it all 😅: 1
 That's probably a good idea: 1
 I'm not sure what went wrong honestly... It just looks really patchy after 2 layers, which is shouldn't... We're gonna try to fix it but yeah, doesn't look great for now! : 1
 You are (probably) massively screwed: 1
 Yeah... I fear for it, I think he will be in front of the door to the garden a lot. he'll demand we let him in because he's lazy: 1
 No 😞: 1
 Thanks and i love you too 😘: 1
 Yeah I'm ready: 1
 I'll definitely keep you up-to-date! No one really asked me any questions, it was just a nice get together with the family. Kind of wished they did, it would give me a great excuse to tell them about you 😅: 1
 Oh fuck... Good luck my love, you can do it! 😘: 1
 Good luck with the presentation!! 🍀🍀🍀: 1
 Hope the like the gingerbread houses. I watch with my family glass onion knives out was pretty nice. I can  recommend it.: 1
 Got a headache, hate life right now but the hug makes it better <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Have fun, hope you get to do something productive though 😘: 1
 Damm i am so german like the English is so eughhh: 1
 Yeah... If it weren't so comfortable and holding good memories... I would never ever wear it 😅: 1
 For me, I think I realised I'm much more independent and dependable than I always gave myself credit for. Really boosted my self confidence a lot: 1
 Ur at the bybane: 1
 How does yours look?: 1
 Allways look at the thinks from a positive side 😅: 1
 She wants to make you jealous: 1
 Oh damm looks nice. Make it from scratch or use use some wine already?: 1
 Well good job I guess: 1
 That works: 1
 No worrys I got this. You can get through it without bashing her head in: 1
 Thanks on Saturday there will be a better one coming: 1
 This might clarify the RFC thingy better than I can 😅: 1
 The audience is really entertaining though: 1
 Good morning beautiful, yeah my night was good hope your was good too 😘: 1
 Damm he got a doctor Titel? Big time rush reference 😂😂 never thought that would be a usefull/interesting think 😅: 1
 I want to but yeah we can call anytime: 1
 Still working on it 😅... Now it's about the placement: 1
 you wont be you will find some i am sure: 1
 I believe u can endure it😁. If there is a good one u can share it with me.: 1
 Yeah kinda nice but alot to do here too: 1
 Let me know when you're here, literally all my bosses are gone already and I have no more work to do 😅... I'm literally working for my BAP right now: 1
 Ah, yes, he just _loves_ getting close and cosy with his opponent: 1
 Free snakes are nice too I guess 😂: 1
 What a travesty: 1
 It's supposed to look nice, kind of also supposed to show how different things can look I guess? The actual pictures are much cooler 😁: 1
 If I cry next time I see you, take it as a compliment: 1
 What time do you want/can you call later?: 1
 Oh, cool! 2,5 hours only? Damn, that's not long: 1
 Love the guy, he's great: 1
 But what it says is "books stay absolutely necessary to properly raise a child": 1
 I'm glad it went well 😘: 1
 If there's one thing I've learnt in the 3 years I've been doing this, in business circles a lot of people do drugs: 1
 I think there's an image of him eating ice cream in there idk: 1
 Yeah, also gonna try to sleep. Thanks love 😘: 1
 Uhu, sure thing hon: 1
 Good morning my love hope you had a great night of sleep: 1
 I have faithhhh: 1
 You don't have to say anything about how he's feeling if you don't want to: 1
 I've been home for 10 minutes... Tell me why I feel lonely already? I thought I was good at this whole 'being on my own' thing...: 1
 Pretty relaxing just doing university stuff: 1
 Wait you saw that 🥲. Yeah my hand are sometimes faster than my brain 😅: 1
 Or mabye unconscious: 1
 Don't forget to bring your own towels and sheets: 1
 Mh don't know can't speak to that: 1
 Thanks i am dead tired now and going to sleep: 1
 Apparently her dog was missing since 12: 1

 okay sounds good will be there on time. I promise: 1
 Gonna eat now, god knows what after that: 1
 At breakfast with my family now 😊: 1
 Well... Uhm... In that case a fair warning for when we go to Berlin, because my dad likes to go to fancy restaurants so yeah... A first time for everything?: 1
 Yeah, I know, but I think if I don't get it done now it will be more difficult in the next couple of weeks if we get more interviews that also need to be transcribed and then to write our whole thesis... better to have it done today.: 1
 Hope u parent had a good impression of him. I didn't want to write you anything to make u feel bad. But I also missed u a lot since yesterday. Love you ❤️: 1
 Nah I don't know a lot of people who would do that for there neighbor.: 1
 Hope you get everything done then. You got this 😘: 1
 Lovely vase. How is work going: 1
 I think I know why the condoms break: 1
 Well learn from others is also great: 1
 Maybe have a study date with Marco? 😁: 1
 We're watching darts at my uncle's place now. What are you up to?: 1
 Verbindung am Mo. 27.05.2024: 1
 Yeah her death was kinda the think that got me hooked: 1
 My mom says that ever since Berlin a lot of things have been going wrong in our house 😅😂: 1
 Gonna drive home now: 1
 Kinda wanna hear it now: 1
 Seriously I can't wait to hug you next week (I'm so happy I can say next week): 1
 Nope i think my mom likes it but dont know for sure.: 1
 Maybe a little, I guess I do know enough about it: 1
 At the bank: 1
 How are you feeling today hon?: 1
 That's what I told her too: 1
 Yeah will see don't know either: 1
 Wait, which 2 things? I think I know one of them but I'm not sure about the other 😅 (I kinda forgot what I wrote): 1
 I love you so much too, I hope to dream about us ❤️: 1
 You have to do the course by yourself because the teacher didn't show up?: 1
 Am I still gonna read the book?: 1
 Your still on the couch or also naked in bed?: 1
 Yup, today first day at Lidl, on my way now. My parents can get a replacement car today so they're doing that and coming home today.: 1
 Communicaton was the one he did: 1
 Mabye lie to her about the reason why I am not there: 1

 Pretty good, dreamt about you again 😅: 1
 How expensive if i may ask?: 1
 Speedrun the 5 stages of grief: 1
 Okay, you want me to walk there or not?: 1
 Ah, gotta love politics at family gatherings! My cleaning is... Not going 😅: 1
 Oh shit yeah, you better get going then 😅: 1
 I hope I get to join in on your dream tonight: 1

 Have a good time with them then, how has your day been other than that though?: 1
 Nevermind, the silence was broken, my dad won the online Scrabble game they were playing (apparently) and now my mom is mad and going to sleep: 1
 Oh a yeah makes: 1
 well yeah u did since norway: 1
 Allright mostly get my schedules back on the track: 1
 Yeah it was really nice and a grwat story still 🥰: 1
 Hope you guys brought something to hide from the rain 😅: 1
 5-10 minutes I think: 1
 Might have made a small mistake in telling Nicolas I'm coming to visit you soon. He said he might want to hang out if he has time, however I didn't tell him where you live, just "somewhere around Leipzig" or when exactly I'll be there so there's a lot of plausible deniability still : 1
 Sounds like a great combination indeed 😘: 1
 I asked what they meant and the only answer they gave me was that I was more myself... Which is just a very vague thing to say 😅: 1
 Okay will remember: 1
 Then that's still an option: 1
 Train is already 20 minutes delayed, if it delays even more I might even miss the train in Frankfurt...: 1
 No worries, I'm pretty much over it already 😅: 1
 Going to bed now the last 20 min of the meeting where exhausting because they got of track so often 😮‍💨: 1
 No, definitely don't want to do that: 1
 We have ads for cars, holidays and all that, pretty much never for insurance, rarely for poker and yeah... We do have fitness ads: 1
 Yup not gonna lie: 1
 Oh it's fucking great, it's a bullshit problem too, pretty sure the software just sucks honestly 😅: 1
 Yup, I think so: 1
 Nearly done need to reread and change some sentence building: 1
 Also, have you ever heard of the word Schilderwald?: 1
 But less stuff to distract you from. Missing me. Great idea every time you miss me start studying 😅😋: 1
 Well need to wait abit for that: 1
 I mean... you know what we say about kissing the homies 😘: 1
 And now we're doing interior design: 1
 Always look on the positive side of things I guess? Still sucks though, makes it harder to have a good time when you're not doing anything necessary: 1
 First I'm watching One Piece with my dad though 😂: 1
 What do you research for it exactly. Like numbers of sold Tabasco or flavor combinations with it?: 1
 That's kinda... Disappointing but well, at least it isn't worse than before: 1
 Nice hope you have a nice conversation with her: 1
 I am so fucking hungry 🥲: 1
 Nah, it's okay, at least there's no 20 abbreviations like my cousin uses... I need a fucking teenage thesaurus to read those sometimes 😭😅... I feel so old at those times 😂: 1
 Okay so we go to my parents house on Sunday lunch. And the escape room we are still planning.: 1
 I don't feel comfortable sending you anything more than I have so far, if that makes sense?: 1
 😅 well yeah probably: 1
 Sounds like it! It's probably a nice state of mind though, not worried about time! We always rush grocery shopping, half an hour max. It leaves time for other things but sometimes I like exploring new things. I hope I'll get it fixed too! Thanks ❤️: 1
 What you do at work today? Get home savely 😘.: 1
 I'm currently in a meeting for my bachelor thesis... Taking too long honestly but it's alright. After that I'm meeting with Alex for lunch, then a meeting with the student council, working on the bachelor thesis and then dinner with my family... Busyyyyy and no time to procrastinate. 😅 Good luck working!! I hope you get to finish everything today!: 1
 Yeah i don't know she is a alien for sure.: 1
 Ah, yeah, no it's not... might have something to do with the fact that it was Lennie who was there, we're still awkward very often if we're alone for some reason 😅: 1
 You know you made my heart skip a beat when I saw your message?: 1
 The hair dresser is at 12 😅: 1
 Going to sleep now too its been a roller-coaster in the last hour 😅🥲: 1
 I would say something more but I literally just woke up and can't properly think right now 😅: 1
 If we find the puzzles of course: 1
 Yeah i taught so. Hope its good news.: 1
 Now after swimming I am so Damm tired. But we still go out to eat now. How was your evening?: 1
 Yeah, I don't know what she needs to do but I don't think it's drawing, she just needs a picture of it. Artists are weirddd: 1
 Yeah it Handy sometimes if I want to relax but it also suck at times: 1
 Yes thanks: 1
 Yeah night was good and I think today I will learn beztet: 1
 Nice if you get intership report done it's a think of your mind 😊. Yeah I got there late but he canceled it because nobody show up 😅: 1
 Idk, depends on the dye, Alex is looking into it: 1
 I mean... We're the same family that made an excel for a holiday so... What did you expect honestly? Hope you find something soon though!: 1
 Going great: 1
 I'm dead: 1
 Sounds like a cures and a gift at the same time: 1
 I still have to do that, problem is that my laptop was bought for my parents' company so their repair guy has to do it for warranty purposes, so it might take a while 😅: 1
 Yeah the chance are slime.: 1
 No didn't know what to say to it 😅. Also making food right now 😋: 1
 Wait no: 1

 Actually goodnight 😘: 1
 Will do the same: 1
 Rice pudding(Milchreis): 1
 Thanks, I would love that <3: 1
 Revenge was served 😁: 1
 It's pretty self-explanatory, it's not open during the day which is probably why I've never gone there before: 1
 Eating dinner now, wanna call in like half an hour?: 1
 Thanks hon, got home safely and then my phone died 😅 honestly pretty good timing: 1
 dont know: 1
 yeah we have a course in betwenn the Präsentation: 1
 What's the weather like in Germany?: 1
 Creepy fact, that was exactly the movie we were gonna watch 😂: 1
 Love you too rabbit 🐇❤️: 1
 Okay, give me 2 mins: 1
 I can't go, I have to work at the tennisclub. His logic is that you can go with him because otherwise you'd be bored the whole evening: 1
 Pretty nice and produktiv but also kida tired now. Will fall a sleep soon.: 1
 Love you too my silly goose 🪿❤️: 1
 Damm Winter is hard for old people: 1

 Hope you make it but still drive save 😘: 1
 God help me I have to present myself to everyone tomorrow: 1

 Drive safely: 1
 Same university stuff only for me today 🥲: 1
 Sorry for the wall of text 😁🙏: 1
 Need to some chores for my parents. After that probably just working on the project until the party starts. How about you? How is you self presenting slide looking?: 1
 Yo, I have tarot cards, I can actually try to see what they say, even if it's fake 😂: 1
 They're talking about how they used to go out when they were young, it's interesting to hear: 1

 Today is gonna go by so slow...: 1

 Cutie really like the twinsiesss: 1
 Hope your night is also relaxing. 🥰: 1
 Yeah gone make some now no worries: 1
 Respectfully disagree, but then again I'm biased because 2 of the best techno DJ's in the world right now (again biased but okay, at least I know it's biased) are Belgian women 😁: 1
 The party is today? I thought it was Saturday, or is this just a smaller thing?: 1
 What?: 1
 Okay, cool, enjoy : 1
 The detour suck. How much did it snow in the last days up there: 1
 How the fuck?: 1
 I'm just having to get used to being apart and communicating over text again: 1
 No got everything: 1
 Yeah, my parents understand everything and I'm in between them on the couch, it's kinda funny. They're pretty preoccupied with their series though: 1
 Yeah, they also have been doing so for a while, but still need Kickstarter for a new product so that means they 1) don't have investors (or not wealthy ones anyway) and 2) probably not a lot of sales/a bad business plan: 1
 Ah, the lovely moment when you're at the appointment before your doctor is: 1
 170 omg: 1
 Damn, okay then, glad that got sorted out afterwards.: 1
 Can't wait to see you tomorrow 😘: 1
 No spoilers please 🙏🏼: 1
 Now enjoy the night with your family! ❤️: 1
 Its a series well mabye i will start watching it later: 1
 Kindergarten teacher?: 1
 That sounds fun 😊: 1
 Glad you had a relaxing day 😊 (wish you could have been here though): 1
 okay get that: 1
 Nice did you buy the pillow and what did you get him?: 1
 Yeah I know you didn't see it, hence the repeat 😘: 1
 And no worrys you can ask me anything I won't be mad or angry any other negative reaction to it: 1
 Shit, that does suck. I hope they didn't fuck it up further trying to fix it though: 1
 Yeah, fair: 1
 Had a pretty good night, I hated getting out of bed though 😅: 1
 Pretty good, I haven't even left the bed yet : 1
 Yeah I hate it too. Was ironing 😅. Hope the rest of work is going well 🥰: 1
 Yeah really nice even though I am the only one in my age group: 1
 There is a bookshop in the station...: 1
 Hahah, yes, for sure 😂: 1
 I don't know everybody got there owe drive at they start to grow on me. Didn't expect to be this into the show: 1
 Walking back now: 1
 Damm okay something shocking in there are or a esteregg?: 1
 He's almost back so we can all go together: 1
 The credits... Idk, she's asking back credits from 2021-2022 so I'm sure they will still want to do that 😅: 1
 I... Have no clue what is wrong: 1
 I hope it doesn't actually feel bad though: 1
 Come to A : 1
 Okay so let me get this straight: 1
 I am doing fine just a little procrastination. My grandfather has his 80 birthday today and we go there for coffee around 15. What are you doing and how are you doing?: 1
 Hmm... I'll check if it's possible, thanks for the tip 😘: 1
 Yeah, no pressure, we'll find something: 1
 Was nice but abit bumpy: 1
 This is weird my wrist feels naked, but in a bad way: 1
 Yeah but it's so confy☺️: 1
 Might call Alex later, may take a nap first though, the work is brain numbing 😅: 1
 How you feeling with yesterday and overall?: 1
 You didn't get what I mean did ya?: 1
 Thank you for taking care of me: 1
 Can't sleep either?: 1
 Can't help with the dad jokes sorry 😅: 1
 Yes, great scene! Love that he doesn't believe him but still somehow cares so much about his life while I feel like he doesn't have anything left to lose? Nice character development: 1
 Yeah but I think most of them are not fully true: 1
 But i also like to shut you up with kisses 😘: 1
 If I didn't want you to have it I wouldn't have sent it in the first place: 1
 Same, but from what I'm seeing on the train it looks nice: 1
 Okay, nap sounds nice 😊: 1
 And this one should arrive at 11: 1
 Yeah my mom told me to clean up and I move after the 15: 1
 Swimming sounds nice 😊: 1
 Not really, but I'll get over it. Just overthinking too much: 1
 How come it's 63 to 82?: 1
 It's gonna be great!: 1
 Sometimes: 1
 It is so busy today 🥲: 1
 Nice idea still. Will do love 🥰: 1
 Yeah I have no idea: 1
 Same, really fucking looking forward to 1) seeing you and 2) going to Portugal with you and 3) spending a lot of time with you instead of just a week at a time: 1
 Studying and some business stuff with Alex and Patrick later: 1
 Is that a question or an answer?: 1
 Well I don't know what to respond to that: 1
 Winter or fall because of the cold and jsut the feeling around them. Don't know how to describe it. Just feels nicer than summer or spring: 1
 Hope you still had a relaxing night and good morning my love 😘: 1
 This gives dc-girl vibes: 1
 Yo, I just realized we're together for 2 months now?? Damn, it feels like much longer somehow: 1
 Remember the guy that wrote Jinte a card? Turns out he's 24 : 1
 Yeah but we are swapping every time somebody dies: 1
 Sounds nice, we don't have anything like that here, you either buy it store bought and ready or you make it fully yourself. Been a while since I had that, might make it sometime this week: 1
 That's more expensive than our two weeks in Portugal??: 1
 K omw: 1
 Oh is he Allright ?: 1
 Honey... Please for the love of God take care of yourself 😭: 1
 Yeah but also useless that I stay there: 1
 Sure thing, just let me know : 1
 Good job. Better than keeping because it got a small wound 😜: 1
 Ah, yeah, I know how you feel: 1
 You look lovely and beautiful by the way 😘: 1
 Eh, she found out she has some trauma because of some shit he did in their relationship so not doing too great but she'll be fine: 1
 That's pretty late: 1
 Arriving to Frankfurt now: 1
 Looks nice, broccoli and what is in the pot?: 1
 Okay, I'll call you when they have left then?: 1
 Yeah allready feels like 1 month or so that we last saw each other: 1
 Don't have any plans, but I should take a shower at some point: 1
 Helping my parents and filling out some forms for my university. That's my plan for today. What about you?: 1
 (very nice of him btw): 1
 Yeah well you get to be a prof not a teacher: 1

 Honestly wouldn't have expected it either, but I guess both of us were wrong? I think for me it's mainly because she's been my best friend for 9 years so it's pretty damn impossible for me to imagine her as attractive to anyone 😅 she's my favourite gremlin, that's about it 😂: 1
 Yes please 🥺: 1
 So I did about an hour of counselling I guess? And then 20 minutes of trying to convince her not to get involved with a guy she told me about that had like 20 red flags popping up...

 Great how won the entire to the Eurovision song contest? Yeah yesterday... First I told Alex I want to be home around 23. We stay until 4 in the morning and I need to drive back because Alex was too tired. We wanted to sleep there first but he had no blankets so we said no. But it's was really nice though 😁: 1
 How is it going ?: 1
 She most definitely can but anyway, I'll skip over that. Honestly you can tell me anything at this point and I don't think it will help much, but thanks for trying 😘 (it's my own mistake for asking you when in all honesty no matter what you said I'll probably still lay awake thinking of shit 😅) sorry about that 😅: 1
 I could try believe in you helping you: 1
 Dart can be interesting to watch, but not a whole evening of it I think! I'm just gonna watch some tv with my parents I think, nothing special: 1

 Yeah get the fear. it's also still evedince for your crimes.: 1
 Google sucks: 1
 Well you can still hate them but yeah it's gone be hard especially because you get in way more contact with God's this way and you see things from there perspective: 1
 I'm glad you're finally home! That was a pretty long drive, are you tired? Yeah, I find it really hard to describe too, attraction definitely though, but other than that I find it really hard to say anything other that it just feels right and comfortable? Idk... It's your fault because you make me feel these things (not blaming you for anything except being too loveable) 😘: 1
 Maybe I'll make it for you next time: 1
 It's pretty good so far, we've only been watching for 15 mins. It's about a good cop and his corrupt ex-cop dad: 1

 Huh? Dont know what you mean but will probably see it at some point: 1
 You are very cute and I am very tempted to tell you to just come over but unless you sort out everything you need to do still, I'm gonna have to tell you no, no matter how much I hate it: 1
 Yeah, I figured 😘: 1
 Happy with that decision or what you think about sales?: 1
 That's nice! So you have 2 classes today then? Eh, it's alright, got some crappy feedback again but I think this time we got it! I'm waiting to get my new ID now...: 1

 Yeah it's great: 1
 Nice, have fun: 1
 Nice, did he get to talk to the girl on the train yet?: 1
 Having a headache out of nowhere sucks so much but atleast i dont need to something important at the moment.: 1
 Wait but that's?: 1
 So the guy just responded... He's very nice now, still not up for small talk but I very much appreciate that as I also don't want to talk to him. But he sent me the thing we used! Don't think I can use it now but who knows: 1

 Nope, just school until 7: 1
 Night hon ❤️: 1
 What are you up to till the party starts?: 1
 Love you brain and no worries i got you 😘: 1
 *funny: 1
 It's a bit weird to me that you can decide to go online or irl and that's not something the prof decides for you, but sounds really nice: 1
 Nice hope it made the train ride abit more bareable: 1
 Okay so I called Aeneas we talk for 10 mins and then the internet broke off. He called me again and we are finish now. We talk about the ski trip, and he left his place in Paris and stuff he did the last week. He wants to call us on Thursday.: 1
 We'll get through the hard days together, okay?: 1
 Hope you have a nice call with Alex: 1
 Well, my mom hates it now and with the all yellow walls I do agree it was a bit much 😅: 1

 I think i really need to get into the merlin TV show.: 1
 Let's goooo!! Good job hon! 🥳😘: 1

 I literally got to school and all of us are pissed already... This is going to be a great day 👍: 1
 Looks pretty nice! You're gonna get your bedsheets tomorrow then? Doesn't look that messy for having just moved in honestly, my room was much worse 😅: 1
 Whatcha up to?: 1
 Sounds pretty nice, I'm honestly doubting to try it out, I've seen a lot of nice things about it: 1
 To come up again and whisper in your ear to not getting to excited because thats only the start: 1
 Hanging out with Jinte and Jasper at their house: 1
 How/what are you doing today?: 1
 You finish setting up your grandpa's computer?: 1
 How awful are we talking? Because I feel like I'm a contender for the title of worst sleep schedule 😅: 1
 Hardly believable but sure, I trust you 😘: 1
 Driving went well, only one argument with my dad at the beginning and we drove for more than 3 hours! Saw my grandparents and now I'm at Jinte's for sleepover 😁: 1
 We can talk about it tonight, it's maybe not that big of a deal but still, want your opinion on it too because it changes some things. Also need to talk to my parents about it if I decide on anything, but yeah, thinking first: 1
 Sad... goodnight then?: 1
 Well it seems like you wanted to move it: 1
 What about you what are your plans?: 1
 I still kinda have to get out of bed 😅: 1
 Hope so too i don't wanna eat Greek so we will see: 1
 Just didn't park as well as I'd like to, like I said, it's alright! Just some more practise! Catching up with friends is always fun, procrastinating isn't though 😅: 1
 Yeah hope so too but they already talk befor right?: 1
 Okay, if you're sure I'll tell her it's fine: 1
 Happens to the best (proof in case being you 😘): 1
 Can't got a shit load to do 🥲: 1
 Driving went okay, not as well as I wanted it to be but it was alright! We're not going to the bonfire, my mom is tired and my dad is meeting with a friend to play padel apparently. How's your day been?: 1
 I think I'm gonna go to sleep, hope I don't wake up with bruises all over my legs from the pole dancing 😅: 1
 Yeah did way to much the last week 😅: 1
 I'm sorry you feel like shit. Maybe getting your mind of it could help? Or just going to sleep until tomorrow morning? I wish I could help ❤️: 1
 Same, also going to bed now: 1
 Yeah, no problem, let's go together 😊: 1
 Paper and relaxing nothing new 🥲. What are your plans for today?: 1
 It's good, we went to Brussels and now we're back in Gent. Aeneas didn't bring his deck 😶 so no: 1
 Makeing food with my mom now so it will still take a while: 1
 (the title is a work in progress): 1
 Yeah okay, I 100% agree with that: 1
 Think about the drama you gone be involved in. But I get it: 1
 Yeah, I think this time it's more disadvantages but it's alright: 1
 Goodnight my love hope we see each other in our dreams ❤️: 1
 Okay next week sounds good: 1
 Got some advantages and disadvantages at times: 1
 You know, every time you mention darts I want to check how Belgium is doing so now I'm gonna look it up: 1
 The kids are just on their phone/iPad, the parents are always pretty nice, it's quite cosy. My aunt is also here with Barry 😊: 1
 Yeah get that mabye there is a good reason for it 🤔: 1
 Yeah, I get that, the smallest things just keep reminding me of you: 1
 You're lucky you're cute and we worked it out eventually 😂😘: 1
 Arriving in Frankfurt... Where I will now be stuck for an hour: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you have a lovely day 😘 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 You wanna text tonight?: 1
 My friend is making cheesecake and I really want some as well, that's what prompted the question: 1
 Sound like a lot of work. How long do you need to work on it? Nights going great played some wizard and went out for ramen. Then we talk a lot about university stuff and some stories with his friends from university. I think we go back now and sleep soon. I am really tried to be honest 😅: 1
 Eh, just reading too much into it again, dw: 1
 My day is going fine still working on my grandparents PC it's a mess: 1
 Don't smile at my pain, you're mean 🥺: 1
 I'm popular today...: 1
 Hope you fall asleep fast 🙏🏼: 1
 This generation 😤😅. But nice: 1
 What should I get them and who should I get things for if I get something for them?: 1
 I am coming over there: 1
 But hey, at least I now have the template ready!: 1
 Morning. I'm not doing too much, looking at hotels and conferences.: 1
 Glad your afternoon is nice though 😘: 1
 Yeah, I'm up: 1
 Sorry just wanna shock you a bit: 1
 You're hot as hell: 1
 Have fun with Elias: 1
 Also i saw you gave the discord your Instagram pushing your followers.: 1
 Yeah no worrys I am good 🥰: 1
 Apparently she didn't eat enough: 1
 You know what, Belgium is inconsistent as fuck, so I will blame his inconsistency on that: 1
 Yeah you go later to uni right?: 1
 Not decide jet but should eat something soon: 1
 It's a good thing but we don't do much just sit around and play games on the side. Don't know how to describe it: 1
 The fact that you knew I was overthinking though: 1
 It's okay, do what you have to do and join us then: 1
 Played some games and right now making dinner for me 😅: 1
 Thank you for the clarification ❤️: 1
 First of all I was never so supprised to be right about a think in my life. Okay what are your Tipps for jinte in this situation? I thought mabye she should try it but I am not there and I didn't talk with jinte so I don't know how she thinks about it. But if she doesn't want to she should tell him. It's hard. Why could he wait a little bit longer 🙄.: 1
 You'll get through it though, no doubt 😘: 1
 Even though it is 28°C in there... Pretty sure that's not healthy to sleep in: 1
 It's about the creation of a Maschine that can work under any circumstances. I don't know it kinda weird but I like it 😅: 1
 Can you explain the difference between chat and text to me? Idk if I'm missing something: 1
 My dad has already started to subconsciously say things in German now... Just to fuck with me... I'll endure it but god knows I will struggle not to choke them: 1
 Na we got something: 1
 From when till when are we in Berlin by the way?: 1
 Talked to my parents about it, that helped a bit but I still feel like shit: 1
 Yeah was okay we finish abit early but okayish I guess and now waiting for the response 🤞: 1
 What time then?: 1
 I mean we can of you want too: 1
 I love your date idea, I'll just sit there and look at you the whole time 😘: 1
 Yup, I'm registered for uni 🥳: 1
 Cool, have fun! 😘: 1
 That's true, it does make sense psychologically. Still, kinda cool/creepy 😁: 1
 And I fucking hate Alex.: 1
 Your seeing the pictures here though?: 1
 And he has not bought my time yet, so I have no clue if it would be interesting or not: 1
 Have fun playing games with Marco!: 1
 Had weird dreams, but no nightmares so I'd say it was pretty good 😊: 1
 Nah, everyone is gonna fail this one anyway: 1
 And maybe driving, we'll see: 1
 Being a great grandchild 👍🏻: 1
 Okay so no mirror pic for me tonight?: 1
 Wanna gaslight her?: 1
 What you mean with your wall. Is the paint bad or did you make a mistake? My mom is persistent on me bring presents to your parents so we went shopping for a plant and a pot for the plant. Can send you a picture later if you want to see it? Now we are grocery shopping for a 1 hour and 30 min. I can't anymore 🥲. Alex wants to do something tonight so we plan to go somewhere. How are you traveling to Brussels  and when do you go with your cousin?: 1
 You have more classes today or you're done?: 1
 Petrificus Totalus: 1
 Nah, not sad for her, she can do without sleeping over. She'd complain that I want to go to sleep too early anyway: 1
 But Mousti is sleeping on my bed and I don't want to kick him out... But I will have to if I want to sleep well tonight... PAIN: 1
 Studying sucks 🥲. How long do you work by the way? Anything interesting happing an work?: 1
 Ah no, Draho isn't a bot, just kind of writes messages like one sometimes for some reason: 1
 ... Enjoy yourself, like I will enjoy you when you get here 😘: 1
 It was sad: 1
 Damm its a old but nice song: 1
 Do you know how to bake? (the answer doesn't really matter) In any case, wanna help me bake some things as a surprise for everyone on Friday?: 1
 Nevermind... I got it somehow: 1
 Sounds nice but it's all draw or do they take pictures with the Accessoires: 1
 1 minuteee: 1
 Yeah and I thought we would do more it was really short: 1
 Never mind can't read: 1
 And just say it again I feel shity and won't ever "replace" you again with Marco or any one else to play gamey: 1
 Good doggos. Just fact on the side like that the dogs are like black and white its kinda cute: 1
 Dentist was okay. : 1
 Yeah, I'm the best I know: 1
 We went for sushi, Latin American, Indian and Dim Sums: 1
 Should be there at 14: 1
 Any chance you feel like calling for a little bit?: 1
 He's a comedian, he's pretty funny I think, but the opposite of dark humour. His last show is a bit of a doozy though, too much accountability and not enough jokes: 1
 I would also be coming over the next week though, so I'll see about the price for train tickets: 1
 Sexy 😘😘😘: 1
 yeah 100% for it: 1
 Yeah i need to finish it at the ende: 1
 I can change him: 1
 Yeah hope so too. How is your day looking?: 1
 For sure it's great to procrastinate with the movies: 1
 That makes more sense but it is a confusing way to say it 😅: 1
 The okay then wasn't supposed to be sarcastic or anything: 1
 Don't see the similarity between Marco and jinte s dad but mabye with time: 1
 Okay, the list: 1
 Ah, I understand. Still I'm sorry for your loss ❤️: 1
 I swear I've seen 4 cyclists being pretty much flattened by a car or buss... The fuck is going on today 🥲: 1
 … I like it when you tease me but it is indeed a lot more fun in person: 1
 Have to start up my laptop first though... Cue the beeping 😭: 1
 How's your day going? was the museum interesting?: 1
 Yeah, I was thinking about working from home, but unfortunately I have a meeting later today so I can't. I'll have a honey waffle probably : 1
 Yeah no, not really? We have to present what our plan is going forward and our client has to agree to that... If she doesn't we are kinda screwed 😅: 1
 Thanks hon ❤️ good luck with studying 😘: 1
 Goodnight my silly goose, love you too a LOT ❤️: 1
 You got this 😘: 1
 Thanks hon you too.: 1
 Well you fully in the role play: 1
 Sure thing, just let me know, there's no rush: 1
 Did you end up sleeping more?: 1
 From mine, it's about the academic quality or something: 1
 My mom says hi btw 😊: 1
 Just out of curiosity, if I'm done eating and I get away from my parents, do you want to still call or not? I can find something to talk about so you don't have to worry about that : 1
 How do you write hooker in German?: 1
 Probably, shouldn't be but yeah: 1
 Yeah he wants to use killians old room as his bed room: 1
 Wouldn't expect anything else: 1
 I hope I dream about you too 🤞🏻: 1
 Ah okay well mabye we can talk about it at somepoint if we feel like it: 1
 Also i am jealous: 1
 Okay but your procrastination a bit: 1
 Ah okay get that was Alex also there ?: 1
 Good morning my love hope you had a good night of sleep too. I had a weird dream. I was working in a supermarket and the line was way too long. I fotgot my code to open the cash register. In the Ende i just talk with the customers.: 1
 Probably 2018, not because it was such a great year for me, but mostly because of how much I grew in that year I think? I had to completely rethink my future path in that year, had to start getting along with completely different people from what I was used to and just... Started looking at the world in a different way?: 1
 Wait... What why and how? But nice that you got it done: 1
 I mean... You're kinda hot as a girl too 😘: 1
 Any plans for tomorrow?: 1
 It's going okish. Working on my papers for university but I have no motivation/jumping on every Opportunity for procrastination. 😅: 1
 I just finished my book..: 1
 Oh yeah, I'm definitely not cleaning double entries... that would make it so much worse : 1
 Around 7: 1
 Nope but tired: 1
 I hate you: 1
 Oh btw, what does 'warten auf anschlussreisende' mean?: 1
 yeah will see and tonight we go too the free food again: 1
 Sounds nice, enjoy it 😊: 1
 But a nice one: 1
 I don't know why it's stressful honestly, I'm just perceiving it as such: 1
 Thx❤️ going in now btw we are only two Alex is sick.: 1
 Which train track?: 1
 In a dress: 1
 He put them on because he thought they were his dad's but they were already kind of fucked up and when he took them off he broke the inside of them completely 🥲: 1
 If I leave now, will you be okay with both of them?: 1
 I love you but I think I miss you more 😘: 1
 Pretty good volleyball was nice and now just talking a shower. How is your day going?: 1
 Yuppp, somehow my dad seemed on board though, so who knows?: 1
 No not really: 1
 That's?: 1
 Sadly true: 1
 For sure! ❤️: 1
 Anyway, I'm going to apply for my driver's licence in half an hour so that's pretty cool 😊: 1
 hope it doesnt spill much and it dons't take alot of layers: 1
 I might ask to work on the same task Gerardo is working on, he's been working on it for nearly a week and is very much over it too, together we might finish it sooner + it's not that bad of a task: 1
 Indeed so: 1
 I also don't want to bother you too much during your exams so you don't have to deal with any more stress by thinking you should pay more attention to me or anything like that. Exams go first, so please don't take this conversation for that: 1
 Okay yeah I think that's some stalker vibes right there: 1
 Ups well how is it?: 1
 I would love to come over hon 😘: 1
 Yeah was great talk alot with my cousin turn 16 this week and in general alot: 1
 It's going okay. First two are over now and the 4 is happening online 😮‍💨. One of the databases is only the teacher talking no stop and it's hard to keep up. How is your day going? Got the task you want? Did you eat lunch with jinte?: 1
 How long do you still need to the train station in Gent?: 1
 Well then fucking the destroy it: 1
 Uh... People are sending voice messages, to let people hear their voices??: 1
 That is incredibly funny: 1
 Let me adjust my words: 1
 2 painkiller Jesus Christus periods suck. Yeah hope the work you get this time is interesting and not something somebody else is already working on 🥲: 1
 You have anything to do? If not wanna call? Idk, just feel like hearing your voice or seeing your face or something 😅: 1
 I'm almost done with the first one which was 35 minutes. The second is almost an hour 🥲: 1
 Not really a party, it's just my parents, aunt and Pieter and the Greek guy: 1
 ... I'm blushing, that was smooth as hell: 1
 Leaving my phone in a charge box to charg for the night ☺️: 1
 silas galen: 1
 Yeah, makes sense, voice recordings distort it a bit <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 The hardest part is too start with work you don't wanna do: 1
 No was great: 1
 Yeah had a good breakfast no worries 😘. What about you? You better eat something when you get home or something free from the company: 1
 I guess they found the kids because we're driving again!: 1
 Look at my course and doing some university stuff mabye some website stuff: 1
 She is DEAD tired 😅: 1
 Also goddamn: 1
 Thanks, so far it's great 😋: 1
 Well you can tell her that you don't like working on useless stuff and it's okay if you give her a worse version than the master because you had less time.: 1
 Gonna go to sleep now. Goodnight hon ❤️: 1
 Shit, this is gonna make me cry: 1
 You better 😤😘: 1
 Why say sorry?? Totally makes sense ❤️: 1
 Hope you get something done though 🤞: 1
 I'm so happy, I don't have to go to work for the rest of the week! : 1
 So be it: 1
 I had a pretty sad lunch, not gonna lie, maiswafels with some raw carrots, had nothing else at home 😅: 1
 Paper isn't going well neither but I will get through it too. Yeah she is arriving at 19: 1
 Well there is enough video and pictures from the night: 1
 Train: 1
 Or a nature documentary: 1
 What's your day been like so far?: 1
 Random question, I'm supposed to cook while they're on a walk, wanna call while I do that?: 1
 Yeah would be weird: 1
 Can I see? I'm curious what you think is ugly af: 1
 (hopefully for real this time): 1
 I'm already in my bed about to go to sleep, no worries 💤: 1
 Playing some games with Elias and talking about the past and what's going on in our lives right now.: 1
 Cant sleep 😐: 1
 Yeah, I have my graduation in the morning and I'll go there in the afternoon: 1
 This cat cafe is amazing, way better than the one we went to in Paris!! And also way less busy, it was just Aeneas and I and then 2 other people: 1
 Unless you're already touching yourself of course: 1
 Now I'll actually get started on my report 😅🥲 xx: 1
 If it's up to my dad we're going to the fancy vegan restaurant they went to yesterday 😅 in Antwerp they don't know a lot except for restaurants either, but I can ask Celine for some tips: 1
 Yes the game?: 1
 Its more about the people there than the location: 1
 I will always be there for you too, promise. ❤️: 1
 Goodnight hon ❤️. : 1
 Smart: 1
 I'm gonna try to get some sleep, goodnight my love ❤️: 1
 Also no answer to the thing I sent you on Instagram? Rude <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 They just went home, you're still playing civ 6?: 1
 yeah it was: 1
 Nice, good luck with that 💪: 1
 Jinte is roasting me: 1
 Especially when it's cold: 1
 Solidarity but I will find a reason soon or later: 1
 No worrys kinda funny 😅: 1
 I also love the Conversations in "the Crow".: 1
 Should work now: 1
 Looks like a great time: 1
 Jesus don't want to be on her bad side 😅: 1
 GPT: 1
 Its okay well music whise not work whise: 1
 Yeah, true, it's weird... I hope it gets straightened out soon: 1
 We get our revenge tomorrow: 1
 You can call me whatever you want ;): 1
 How is the weather in Belgium?: 1
 Yeah seems weird but the relationship between the two is still a bit off I think: 1
 Sounds nice that your parents support you. Yeah we did the think with the phones. The first person to look at there needs to pay. But nobody did 😅.: 1
 Dude... You're not gonna tell me datenight is gonna be way later and then follow it up by making me jealous of a car... Not a good idea my guy: 1
 They'll probably only be finished tomorrow but I'll send you what they've accomplished today: 1
 Honey... We both know you're a massive procrastinator... But if you manage to do that I will be impressed for sure! 😊: 1
 Idk, I'm pretty sure it's not something personal against me but it's still odd: 1
 And the rest: 1
 Yeah it do be like that. Same at my end: 1
 I am sorry for them but i keep saying that they could leaf me be. I will keep training: 1
 I would give him the benefit of the doubt as well, were it not that Jinte  asked him about it and he quickly left without answering 😅: 1
 We are playing werewolf: 1
 Yeah sure need to see which day but yeah: 1
 hey for the Horror Movie mabye "the Nun": 1
 no Problem: 1
 Love the cat and dog just walking around: 1
 Should I take reserved places on German trains? I have no clue how it works 😅: 1
 Today was actually a lot of fun: 1
 Will see hope the rest of work goes by fast 😘: 1
 My dad said they have some good players. I don't know what we cook. I just cut and do what my mum and sister tell me to do 😅: 1
 Okay, are you coming to A?: 1
 So he's taking pictures now, apparently he wants us to look natural in our work environment so he's asking us to talk to the person next to us... The conversations are hilarious: 1
 I'll look it up, sounds interesting : 1
 Nah just sounded like she gets kick out: 1
 I hope so too, don't strain yourself ❤️: 1
 There now by the way: 1
 How's the project going? You figure it out?: 1
 I don't think it's the right link though... My colleague was saying something about personality characteristics which is not what this is, then again, it's just funny to calculate how many camels someone is worth: 1
 I said the name Falco and he said yes 😂: 1
 I think I made it worse, the guy greeted me and our HR guy said "so Manon, you heard it, when he takes pictures act natural": 1
 You talking with your parents about or alex/jinte?: 1
 Good morning beautiful 😘: 1
 Not that long, you drive that!: 1
 Gonna take a shower now, will tell you what happened later: 1
 Indeed you don't, she also told me about her last job where she needed a specific product number or something and the guy just didn't give it to her (forgot or something) so for 2 months she would place post-its everywhere on his desk until he told her 😅: 1
 I knew it already but hearing it from you again makes me really happy 😊: 1
 No never i know what each for it self is but together never heard/seen it. But sounds like a interesting combination.: 1
 Nice people: 1
 Sadly but to be honest excepted: 1
 Its not as impressive as you think I just have it open while I watch some YouTube 😅: 1
 Also the only person i also had in mimd: 1

 But with multiple-choice it's always hard to tell: 1

 I do, I love it 🥰: 1
 I think I'm done packing: 1
 Oh yeah, I've tried like a billion of those so called 'tips' to cut onions but so far the only ones that actually work are to use a very sharp knife, water on your hands and cutting them under the ventilator, and yet... still crying every time: 1
 My phone dieing didnt help the howl feeling shitty about it either. In contrast it nade it worst for me 🥲: 1
 By the way i got time for tonight and we could call after dinner so around 20ish. If thats fine with you my lady?: 1
 It's okayyy: 1
 Yeah... The only reason my parents trust them is because they've done work for friends of ours and because (quoting my dad) "I know where he lives" but they do seem pretty sketchy. Guess we'll see: 1
 Hahaha, love that: 1
 Please call me when you want: 1
 Its okay but i felt kinnda off for you: 1
 I'd also kinda appreciate it if you could try not to leave me on read for too long? Idk, I know you don't do it on purpose but it makes me feel like I did something wrong 😅: 1
 That... Sounds shit indeed but also really funny: 1
 (except you're mine and unfortunately very much not in my area): 1
 Yeah wasn't it?: 1
 Yeah and yeah: 1
 Good morning my love my night was great and yesterday was a lot of fun. Know that you didn't sleep that well hope you day is not too exhausting. What are your families plans?: 1

 I just got home from my family, the stories I heard of when they used to go out in their youth are crazy! So many fights 😅: 1
 Made some fried rice: 1
 Also, I told my parents... Quite honestly their reactions were quite funny. My dad especially, he got up to get a glass of whiskey first of all 😅... And then he said he's happy you're at least German 😂... My mom was just happy!: 1
 And yes, it works splendidly for me, thank you very much, I'm very happy 😘: 1

 In Frankfurt now, 30 minutes to waste: 1
 People with gun and knife kinks: 1
 My internet being shitty as always : 1
 At times I forgot it was live music because it fit so well, and the director of the orchestra also composed the music himself, was pretty cool : 1
 That sounds really weird. Hope he doesn't need to go again for a third time.: 1
 It hurts to see how much someone lights up when they get a compliment... Fuck people should get compliments more often.: 1
 Hope you had a great night 😘: 1
 Yes obviously hon ❤️: 1

 Vorzeige schwieger Sohn: 1

 Sucks hope your get some sleep at least 😘: 1
 I mean, it fucking understood me when I made a word joke... 😅: 1
 She got locked out, so I climbed over the wall. Pretty high, I think more than 3m? But the backdoor was open so once I got over I could just open the front door for her 😊: 1

 I think i will be done soon. 8 hours of sleep is important hope you have a great day at work and it's not too tiring 😘: 1
 Thursday is good to call him! Is he having a good time skiing? DnD session could be Sunday, but I also was thinking of inviting Jinte over (because Aeneas wanted to meet her) for dinner, might make it lunch instead then idk: 1
 Good morning. I am so excited for today 🥰 I am still packing my things. I am gone start driving around 11 I think: 1
 I hope you get it today then!: 1
 You're ceo? Oh man this is amazing: 1
 Just taking a small break from painting today and visiting my grandpa. What & how are you doing?: 1
 But nothing brok so far: 1
 I'm happy when you're happy: 1
 Yeah tinder is crazy we got one friend who has a account and sometimes we swipe together for fun. After that he meet some of the people and there were interesting: 1
 Yup sorry 😅: 1
 We didn't play. We played monopoly and I won but monopoly is not really funny 🥲.: 1
 I am doing okay just a lot of social interaction. I am kinda tired but it's okay. Back at my friend's apartment. Sleeping there for the night. They want to eat out at place they found in the last month's.: 1
 I miss you too, can't wait to get on that damn train again 😘: 1
 Ahh okay so you gone make some or you gone ask her if I can come over for some cake?: 1
 Oh yeah, Alex will probably be late, only around 18 or something because she forgot they're striking today 😂: 1
 Of course you do 😂: 1
 Yeah we play online now: 1
 Kevin?: 1
 We're there: 1
 Oh no, I'm not talking about my parking skills, just about literal parking spaces being available 😅: 1
 Well hang in there only 2 weeks right: 1
 Hope the weather gets better when your done with work: 1
 I totally get that, my family is amazing but sometimes I can't stand being around them 😅: 1
 I know, don't worry about it, I think you're doing great 😘 and like I said, if you don't feel comfortable with something just let me know. I really appreciate you trying but I would never want you to do something you don't feel good with 🥰: 1
 Won't be possible anyway, my mom is home: 1
 Now u can relax ☺️: 1
 I hope she doesn't have too much energy or I'll be dead 😭: 1
 Let me know if they're any good at it 😊: 1
 Chill, enjoy the relaxing day then 😘: 1
 Also we weren't allowed on our phones or laptops until now... I feel like I'm back in high school, it's weird as hell: 1
 okayish talking with marco and ole abit: 1
 I can't get you out of my head. Practically everywhere I look I see you. It's in really stupid things or random people most of the time, but you're always to be found somewhere: 1
 Fair enough 😂: 1
 Yeah, she says I need a new jacket 😅: 1
 Today is exsausting cant wait for date night 🥰: 1
 Yeah, we're going to the reception of a cycling race event. It's really difficult to explain it but basically it's organised by the father of my aunt's ex boyfriend but we get free tickets because my parents sponsor it so we take full advantage of it to have free food and drinks : 1
 The birthday party is finally over I love them a lot but longer than 3 hours is hard. How is your day going?: 1
 That's true!: 1
 Okay just tell me what info you neeed: 1
 AH sucks: 1
 Okay, thanks, I'll try to get to Aachen before I get too stressed though, we'll see once I get there 😅: 1
 I will, and only for you 😘: 1
 A places i kinda wanna see in finnland "Kummakivi ": 1
 So many celebrations! We're thankfully done with those! I'm just going to show my family the fantoft church and a couple of other things today, pretty chill: 1
 We are done bought some stuff mostly for us all: 1
 What are you up to today? More working on the paper?: 1
 The train is leaving: 1
 Yeah, why do you ask?: 1
 Allright did procrastinat abit to much and no motivation: 1
 I mean I guess that's a thing, but I'm pretty sure that was just how she sounds?: 1
 Exhausting to be honest and now I need to overlook them again 😓: 1
 Burgers are nice! No clue what we're eating tonight... 🧐: 1
 Yeah you still want to?: 1
 Is it okay if I'm in Leipzig by 15: 1
 Have fun and be safe on the hiking trip 😘: 1
 No worrys I am the same 😅🥰: 1
 Hope you still get something productive done today (unless you're happy with what you did in that case good job 😘): 1
 I don't know but yeah probably 😅: 1
 Nah it's alright : 1
 Thanks i geuss 😅: 1
 Yuppp, worst dancer there, I'm easy to find 😅: 1
 Cleaning up a datasheet: 1
 We're preparing for that now: 1
 I might just take you up on that offer 😘: 1
 Going driving again, then preparations for painting my room, nothing special: 1
 Oh okay, that's cool: 1
 I'll eat enough, don't worry ❤️: 1
 Apparently that was normal back then???: 1
 If you feel like it sure: 1
 Of course I'll worry about that. You should have your time with your friends, I don't want to take you away from them. But I'll respect whatever you want to do, just allow me to want to understand your decisions okay?: 1
 But if you wanna we can call in 20 mins: 1
 Yeah ole went back to Leipzig and Marco didn't come he got sick: 1
 She's doing her internship there at a headhunting firm, should be interesting for her! : 1
 I don't know why but I think because writing is weird. It's german and we write in English.: 1
 phone dead: 1
 I didn't even ask to be in there 😭: 1
 Well you got the experience 😘: 1
 The t Shirt say it all: 1
 Uh... I know Ritter Sport and apparently according to my research Merci is also German, which makes absolutely no sense: 1
 Just a couple of minor details that might make it more powerful, I still have to adjust things to the campaign anyway! Yeah, Luna is starting a new campaign with some online friends soon and she watches a lot of videos about it so she knows a _lot_ more than I do. Definitely left Jinte out of that conversation... She did scouts so she *should* be good at navigation you would think 😅: 1
 Yeah no, go to sleep hon: 1
 Yeahhh, some are making fun of it now, it's pretty funnt: 1
 Love that xD: 1
 Yeah nah, I don't have time. I have to go to the store first and then Cato is there already so... I don't have any time to relax today : 1
 yeah sounds: 1
 Also hers went not so well so she needs to go to alot of check ups. Can  not meet eith us for 3 weeks thats really shitty. Should have taken like a week: 1
 Try to have some fun first though ;): 1
 It's actually pretty busy 😅, but interesting! How's your day going? You ate all the croissants?: 1
 Sounds like a good choice to look for something else: 1
 ah okay how did the dnd planing go ?: 1
 Haven't had any ads yet, but apparently one of the commentators got their car stolen on new years, so fun story about that I guess?: 1
 Trying to manage dinner in this house before 8 is practically impossible 😅: 1
 Not like I have much experience either (literally none) but I have friends who are guys and I have friends who have dated guys: 1
 Aeneas is gonna join us: 1
 Just today: 1
 Okay but are you sure: 1
 She doing great but 6 hours train ride was tiring.: 1
 Fuck i got everything in there. Okay: 1
 All the fucking sauces: 1
 True, but the reception is triple so bad, everyone here is part of the "better class" people like the mayor of the city, rich people, CEO's all that shit: 1
 Only blue i am shit at ski again its crazy: 1
 Give me 2 mins: 1
 And I'm not talking just darts, literally any competition: 1
 Even Jinte's brother asked her if he was hitting on her: 1
 The BAP meeting is online? Hopefully the window will be done sooner. My plan for today is just university volleyball and dinner with my parents nothing special but it's a lot for one day 😅: 1
 Yeah, I finished the task, my senior was very happy with it 😊: 1
 Give it 15 minutes and it's over 😂: 1
 Yeah it's kinda over 0 vs 4. My mum already went ot bed and I think I will go too soon: 1
 Yeah so far: 1
 Boy... You're gonna driving I don't fucking think so: 1
 Just some notes and other exam thinks: 1
 Ah, lucky you: 1
 I watched a documentary about a man who travelled for  years with my mom the other day, also really interesting: 1
 To you or your dad?: 1
 My night was alright I guess. I'm at work already yes : 1
 Money is a weird think. Alex ,me and his dad talk about it Yesterday. It is so weird to talk about and it can get really stress full. Not that is with you i would buy you everything i can but its a weird topic: 1
 Reading over it now with Alex on discord and then send it in: 1
 Not really free time, still gotta work on the BAP but at least it's at home 😊: 1
 Alex sent me a message at 4am that they were outside in the cold, not sure what was happening and there was a lot of smoke: 1
 Me neither: 1
 Let me look at that... I think there's like 15 movies on there?: 1
 Its still stuffs though: 1
 But mabye you should go to bed now do you get some hours of sleep?: 1
 Okay, good to read: 1
 Yeah free my boy he did nothing wrong: 1
 Yeah, BTW I told pineapple that he could join us if he wants too: 1
 Love the hate for the inconsistency I have it two: 1
 Good morning my love nope not yet will be over the coming day i think. Hope you have a great day too. Hope you hsve fun while you paint 😘: 1
 To be fair: 1
 Idk, maybe that's just a me thing but I could not handle an on and off relationship, it would hurt too much trying to pretend everything is fine: 1
 Tap ur cards together: 1
 Hahah, maybe, but I think twilight is more likely to drive me mad than get me to sleep 😂: 1
 But it could change any time☺️: 1
 Better get to work then 😘: 1
 I have a class on campus and then 15 minutes later online... So it's good that I don't live far from school but I will still have to rush home: 1
 Yeah still I would hate him: 1
 What is your all time favourite dish? Or, alternatively, if you could only eat 1 food for the rest of your life, what would it be?: 1
 What am I supposed to do when you say things like this???: 1
 Update, not going to the party, instead rethinking my decisions in the last year or so : 1
 Nah, I have no faith in Belgium in any competition we enter, some shit always happens that throws us off: 1
 Hmm, not in a normal context please, but as a joke I don't mind: 1
 Looks nice mabye  i will try some of the course: 1
 Wrong button: 1
 (jk): 1
 She also thinks he looks like her dad 😅😂: 1
 True he is a cunt: 1
 Boyfriend has entered the chat 😭: 1
 No, Hannover: 1
 Yeahhhh... He doesn't do shit despite it though, there's an artist guy that kinda stole his bike 3 years ago and he knows where he lives yet still hasn't done anything about it: 1
 I'm gonna be dead before the end of today 🙃: 1
 Okay? Sure, I'll ask you tomorrow : 1
 Hope so too, it's quite nice like this. But it'll probably get a bit more busy soon as there are more people playing at 6. Nah, I don't have a coworker normally, yesterday was an exception because it was so busy.: 1
 Yeah my is Mannheim 😅: 1
 Please don't spend all you money: 1
 So she wanted me to ask you about it: 1
 Well dont let your anger out on the table please 🙏🏼.: 1
 It's probably universal but goddamn it, we really can't stand them 😂: 1
 6 hours i think it will be: 1
 We can sure sounds lovely 🥰: 1
 Waiting outside till your done: 1
 The aggressive way but you kknow that allready: 1
 *wait: 1
 Nah, thanks for that actually, we didn't realise it 😂: 1
 But so far she's ranting to me about how good of conversations they have and apparently the person sent her a video of them cooking in uhum... Not a lot of clothes so Alex basically doesn't really know how to cope at the moment 😂: 1
 Thanks, but like I said, isn't even my fault... It just doesn't want to open for some reason ^^': 1
 Well, if I get to come it will be a good way to practice my German, if I don't I'll take a book with me: 1
 Going great gone make some lunch soon. How is your day going what are your task at work right now?: 1
 I really missed you today. It was fun hanging out with Aeneas but I wish you were there too 😅: 1
 I am still so fucking tired 😴: 1
 Oh yeah, very disappointed I'm sure: 1
 Pretty good, they're friends: 1
 I was wrong, still sending invitations 😅😭: 1
 Yeah i am not sure if they have something even: 1
 It's also definitely not like Alex and I didn't plan a whole bunch of things that we now have to adjust,, not at all : 1
 I watch the last 2 episodes of ragnarök now. i need more episodes. The ending was just some much questions about what gone happen next: 1
 Sounds nice! Hope you have fun 😘: 1
 Working for my BAP isn't the worst thing in the world, at least I'm getting something done: 1
 Okay ready too: 1
 My great parents invited for lunch but my Great grandfather died so I don't know if they still have the time. The rest of the day I have nothing planned now. Are u going to take a farry tonight? Did u already pack everything?: 1
 I need to drive my sister somewhere and my family watches darts. Tonight we cook together again will be fun. Hope you enjoy the night with ur cousin and grandparents: 1
 *meet: 1
 Our new window 😅: 1
 No clue, haven't been checking since like 20 minutes: 1
 Lost it, looked for it and less than 5 minutes after I lost it I went to the reception and they had it... Fucking lucky: 1

 Anyway, why would I have to bribe you for this?: 1
 Thanks honey love that you love my flaws 🥰: 1
 Still messed up: 1
 I will not be scared anymore and i love you too. I will but i am a very understanding person to the point its not understanding anymore. I am just that way.: 1
 Those are short transfer times: 1
 Oh sorry got back half a hour ago and started cleaning my room😅.: 1
 Pizza 😅: 1
 We literally told him we want to kill our client (Ruben's fault) and he was totally chill about it... Madman: 1
 If I get to a couple of pages I'll send it to you, it's kinda shit now though 😅 Yeah, I guess it's kinda odd that it interests you, but if you want to give it a try, why not? Fair warning though, it's probably gonna be pretty dark, revenge arc and all that. I also don't know why I'm writing about this honestly, probably the influence of the music I was listening to?: 1
 There's gonna be a third and final season apparently but god only knows when: 1
 Get that so much. How is your day?: 1
 We were gonna look at a boat tour/wine tour in Porto: 1
 (with options I mainly mean for you guys): 1
 Have fun with Marco and Ole! You're gonna play games or hang out and do some other things?: 1
 I'm still working on the social media targeting but I just don't really know where to go with it now 😅... I'm fucking stuck. Oh, and our project plan was rejected again 😭.: 1
 A bit more than a week 😘: 1
 Scratch that: 1
 I was straight up against the relationship. Yeah it just hurts to see your friends like this and then they are blind by love to see the other person.: 1
 Yeah sorry for spoiling it: 1
 Good sleep is really nice 😴: 1
 I was thinking maybe the 16th would be better for 2 reasons: 1
 Okay what did you read into it?: 1
 I'm making plans for January with my parents now, any clue when you'd want to come here/go to France?: 1
 Pls: 1
 It's better than it looks, if I could just stay concentrated I could have finished much earlier for today 😅: 1
 Okay well you can take your time with finding what you wanna do i aslong as you work as something and keep looking its all good. I will try to support you with that ❤️: 1
 I think i can come around the 15 to Belgium if everything works out btw: 1
 Hopefully the class will get more interesting the next couple of weeks then: 1
 It's not fair: 1
 Looks really crazy now. But you could still cook there right?: 1

 Sure, if you want me to: 1
 I'm not sure, I think we both fell asleep: 1
 EHBO diploma graduation thingy: 1
 My would be my friend Ole and his decision to go back to his ex because she was a toxic nightmare. She didnt call him or text him he didn't receive any love from her its was hard to see a friend like this and he was still so in love. I don't know even thing about it makes me sad and mad at her. In the Ende after 2 years he final realized it and I was so happy for him: 1
 But also what the fuck is wrong with this program: 1
 Yeah, sounds good: 1
 I just realised I should have left half the lovers tea box with you, that way we could drink tea together on date night... Ah... Thought of it too late 😅: 1

 Business and family dinner sounds really interesting 😅: 1
 Yeah know what you mean: 1

 Although there's some drama, but still 😅: 1
 Eh, will see, Jinte just woke up too: 1
 Okay, I just tried it and it looks pretty nice, but to have the 'full' experience apparently you need to pay so that kinda sucks: 1
 Oh no, I'm joining Alex in their class. It's the history of Belgian politics, surprisingly interesting!: 1
 Hope it's not too exhausting so you can enjoy it too, and that you can get some sleep tonight. What happened on the drive btw?: 1
 *13: 1
 Hope you get home savely 😘: 1
 We're going there now 😊: 1
 If u have the time can u grap my bed sheet in the dryer (6 one the right side) in like a hour and 10 min: 1
 I don't know benefit of the doubt mabye 🤔: 1
 Did you just get awkward because of my parents or just because you had to find something to talk about?: 1
 Hope you make the deadline but this is really cool!!!: 1
 Ah, same on the procrastinating : 1
 But tired but okay: 1
 I'm sad you don't have snacks, but honestly I don't think we have anything good either: 1

 I'll be asleep when you wake up, but good (very early) morning and have a safe drive hon 😘❤️: 1
 I just got home, also going to sleep now: 1
 Eh, for now alright, we'll see what happens I guess: 1
 People at my internship place are insane... 1 of my colleagues is pretty much stalking a guy because he doesn't answer her emails about a project we did in 2018 😅: 1
 Good, we have the initial 3 sessions planned unless you guys fuck something up, in that case I'm in charge of improv : 1
 Said the same thing and we were excited to see you try and for the howl trip on it self 😁: 1
 That's our one brain cell working together in a stupid way: 1
 Love that you feel that way but I'm sure you'll think differently once we're actually there... I'm clumsy on flat ground, nevermind on snow and skis 😅: 1
 Yeah i mean its still a student party: 1
 Looks really nice i love it: 1
 After that (we were there for over 2 hours because it was so much food we needed a break in between 😂) we went around for a walk, was nice but Brussels this time of year is way too fucking busy with tourists, had a drink, went for another walk and then home : 1
 I fell a sleep again yesterday sorry: 1
 I mean, rather that than the writers just dragging it out and writing a bad storyline for money: 1
 Probably just preparations for the San Francisco conference some of the employees are going to. Lots of emails and all that but probably nothing too special. Not entirely sure though: 1
 Now I just have to put together my curriculum and pay the fee but that's it: 1
 Also because he called Emma (the creator of the group) blind for agreeing with me: 1
 Change of plans, not doing shit for school today 😅: 1

 Look at it from the positive side, Babysteps 😊: 1
 Why are you trying to actually get me to try and become a god? 🙃: 1

 PEAK FUCKING EFFICENCY: 1
 Well all good with the german I didn't study  any Dutch with book till now 😅. Hope mabye you can watch the recordings from yesterday in your work time?: 1
 Honey, we've talked about this, there isn't necessarily a need for a solution with everything I complain about. In this case I know for a fact that there is a solution that works for me, but we can talk about it some other time, like on a call or something. There's no need for a quick fix. Also me sending you these kinds of messages is my way of saying I miss you 😅: 1
 Wow, that's a really nice view...: 1
 Almost 😅: 1
 Thats nit good nit even snacks or anything 🥲: 1
 The good old uni life ;) good luck in classes!: 1
 Discussing who to kill to make sure we pass the year now... Lovely conversations I swear: 1
 5 min and I am omw: 1
 Well one is reserved but will see: 1
 Sound like a great idea hope you can help/calm him down a bit more.: 1
 What am I gonna do with you??: 1
 Yeah, we're at the side of the road: 1
 I am doing something productive for once 😂 it's sad and kinda funny that I get what you mean 🥲: 1
 What comment that you would look good together? or What: 1
 Same wish you were here now. You the only person I am never sick of ❤️: 1
 its getting worst and worst 😅: 1
 Oh no, not the meeting I was talking about I think? It's the one with the guy with the money?: 1
 Up for date night tonight?: 1
 You'll have better days though, no worries 😘: 1
 I was joking, you really don't have to explain yourself to me 😭: 1
 Do you like cheesecake?: 1
 Would love to take a shower with you 🥰: 1
 You kinda do look like a pimp though 😅: 1
 Yeah sure I would love too if thought I also have no idea but we can guess together 😘: 1
 And how was it ? everyting went okay ?: 1
 Oh they also thought about going to Croatia: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you have a good day. You leave for München in the afternoon?: 1
 Better question, do you have wifi?: 1
 Okay you got some nice ones at least xD: 1
 This is not fun, I feel stupid: 1
 Okay, thank you!! 😘❤️: 1
 Who knows though, he might just surprise us! (If he's drugged): 1
 I believe again too: 1
 Hope you get something done and that you eat something nice, but please don't forget we're calling Aeneas in an hour 😘: 1
 Yo, what songs does he know, I want them: 1

 Getting abit too late: 1
 Yeah nah, not planning on it, I just want to stay in the background and get out of here after next week: 1
 Nah, I should have the time for it 😘: 1
 Yeah I would think so too it's just funny. Respons would be my parents have hammer and a sickle but there no comis: 1
 Found the English books 😊: 1
 Though if it ever happened I would not be surprised in the least: 1
 And you went for a walk?: 1
 No worrys I think it's the last stop and I will get you 😘: 1
 Nope, I realised I'm not in Bergen anymore and felt unsafe at the thought of going by myself 😅: 1
 Nice 😊🥳: 1
 Is this how I should imagine 16 year old Niki?: 1
 Okay. Is there anything I can do to make you feel less awkward during our calls? I honestly really don't understand what you mean though, because I never feel you're doing anything weird? You're just being your lovely self. Is it something I do that makes you feel weird about it? I get that it's a mix of emotions. I told you before, I really don't mind if we call and it's just quiet on both ends while we both do different shit, but I get if that makes you feel weird. Quite frankly I'd love to call more, and I would also like it if you initiated a call sometimes, but I get that might not be so easy if you feel weird about it.: 1
 I don't know how to leave 😅: 1
 Yeah sure, give me a minute, I gotta move: 1
 Probably same: 1
 I think both my parents and I like to be on our own sometimes, so privacy is pretty important I guess? How are you so obvious about that though?? I keep getting surprised by how oblivious I clearly must have been 😂: 1
 For the record, this (for once) isn't because I'm a social recluse, Celine has a headache and I don't want to go alone with Arne: 1
 Pretty nice nearly done with everything: 1
 I also asked and I can work from home on Friday 😁: 1
 Ah okay you too horny i sse: 1
 Let's gooo 🥳🥳🥳: 1
 Is your cousin gone come over or do you have a another plan for today?: 1
 I love you and I can't wait until Sunday to see you and hug you and kiss you again. I miss you so much it hurts sometimes: 1
 Ah don't say that i will make you beg more for it 😘 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Had a nice time meeting up with my friend at the library, she went on Erasmus in Germany actually!: 1
 Love that 4 is more than normal. Like normally I  only have 2 accidents on my way home 😅: 1

 Hope you didn't pull a muscle 😅: 1
 Cue the whole table laughing and him being really happy 😂: 1

 Just no suicide in general: 1
 Yeah, apparently we also have it for July but I'm not gonna look at that until next semester. To be fair, some things about it can still change but it looks pretty definitive for now: 1

 Yeah going to a lecture of Alex now because I miss read the time we have classes: 1
 Yeah kaufland mainly: 1
 Btw, we're calling at 20 again tonight right?: 1
 Nothing else planned for today, what about you?: 1
 Aeneas wants to call us tonight, idk if you have time?: 1
 It should also all be in there now: 1
 whatever you want hon, but if you're more comfortable waiting to call I don't mind: 1
 It will be very interesting for me to see you 2 meet... And how awkward it will be: 1
 Wednesday's morning.: 1
 So, how long over time did the prof go?: 1
 I hope so too because the table is ready and everything 😅: 1
 😅❤️: 1
 It's going pretty well, my mentor is on a holiday until Friday so I'm just doing the tasks she put out for me to do. Pretty chill. How's your day going?: 1
 I have a surprisingly easy time falling back asleep after waking up from them though, it's kinda weird. But having you there would always be better 😘 (though I also think the chances of me having a nightmare when we're sleeping together are a lot smaller): 1
 Vases yeah, you're right: 1
 Me too : 1
 no shit: 1
 Nope so yeah not that hard / extrem: 1
 Seeing a message from you does give me more energy though, it's nice: 1

 Well... Hope it's interesting: 1
 Fair enough, might look it up to see what it's about just because I can: 1
 Hurting the furbaby always brings such pain to my heart 🥲: 1
 I think that's probably too much to ask, but one can hope! 🙃: 1
 I mean... Ah: 1
 ah okay hope you have some good musik then: 1
 Or just Hendel & Stiwi: 1
 I can't deal with these people together 😭: 1
 On the positive side, I found a great present for Aeneas 😊: 1
 Ah... Aeneas is officially 23 now: 1
 I get how you feel hon, 100% ❤️ unfortunately you just gotta get through it I'm afraid 😅: 1
 You have any movie recommendations?: 1
 At least you learnt something?: 1
 Yeah learned a bit. Nice presents pretty sure he will love it 🥰: 1
 You can look at them if you wanna too: 1
 Not too much trouble with bad Belgian drivers I hope 😜: 1
 Oh, have fun! With the bear deck or is it not finished yet? Anyway, I'll stop bothering you, hope you enjoy the games 😘: 1
 Also, can I ask for a very small favour please? 🥺: 1
 I miss you and I love you so much ❤️: 1
 Yeah it was later but they move the time up a bit I don't know why though: 1
 Took long enough for someone to make a comment about me and my coworker 🙄: 1
 what are you up to today? I see you have a class at 1: 1
 But I would love to cute them for you well. I also thought about a video where somebody put on diving Googels too cut onions. Well I believe in your cooking skills that no onion will ever keep you from cooking a good meal 😅: 1
 Well, since you replaced me with Marco 🙄 (jk) I guess I'll call Alex now 😂: 1
 But it's good to know it doesn't annoy you when you see a shit ton of texts from me: 1

 Studying really does suck 🥲, I feel sorry for you: 1
 Yesssss 🥳: 1
 No worries, it's a peaceful protest: 1
 Yeahhhh... I fucking suck at doing things I don't like when there's no hard deadline 😭😅: 1
 You also look really cute when you're gaming btw: 1
 Just call me when you're ready then: 1
 We talk to 3 teams. One of the had a app where the track movement and play Musik according to your movement. The other team had a pharmacy app or something like that. Last team I forgot but wasn't real great: 1
 Yeah i am probably going to sleep soon after i ate food: 1
 I lied: 1
 Why would you leave me???: 1
 Bahaha, of course you do: 1
 (just kidding): 1
 Yeah i am sure of it 😘: 1
 Well they suck but i kinda get it if you don't wanna think about it because else you will miss them more but still suck over all: 1
 Good morning, getting ready to leave to the train station now, I'm tired as fuck 😅: 1
 Love you too ❤️♾️: 1
 You're already back? Damn that's early: 1
 Hope the pain goes away tonight 🙏🏼. Your still powering through work? Or are you at home?: 1
 But now I'm thinking about it I'm kind of annoyed that you went away to game considering you play 8-12 hours a week and while I don't keep count, I'm very sure we don't exactly call that much. Then again, you type really slow so it's possible texting amounts to that time, in that case I shouldn't be annoyed I guess. Do with this thought plan what you want I guess: 1
 I've gone to buy Aeneas a present but now I found a pillow I want to buy for myself... Screw fluffy things, I'm such a sucker for them 😭: 1
 But it still happens unfortunately: 1
 happens to all of us at times: 1
 Actually nevermind: 1
 jk: 1
 Good be strong what else are you up too resting i hope 🙏🏼: 1

 Nah sometimes it's good: 1
 You make my heart beat faster when you say things like this, you know that? ❤️: 1
 Everzwijn: 1
 My sister told me something and that she was a bit worried it wouldn't work: 1
 I just checked my calendar and it's Aeneas' birthday on Wednesday!: 1
 Yeahhhh, she has the business and is still doing an advanced master's in IT right now 😅: 1
 I really want to hear your voice right now. Do you mind calling or something? Idk 😅: 1
 I start going hard ehile you try to not moan amymore: 1
 Hope you had a good night: 1
 Eh, she'll live: 1
 Taking with aeneas: 1
 Sadly my hands will never feel as good as yours do when you're touching me: 1
 Well nice so you gone meet up with her?: 1
 Okay, that's fair, I'll do that next time then. Love you too ❤️: 1
 But right now its probably not a good idea to start a hobby like playing video games. Could get suck into it: 1
 I would say that's the most impressive thing: 1
 Relaxing and reading mabye working on the project if I feel like it. Hope you can relax in peace. Mabye sleep a bit 😊: 1
 As long as you know I'll be there for you too, pain or no pain. We'll do this together ❤️: 1
 Sadly could taste freedom 😅: 1
 Sounds good, we're having leftover lasagna: 1

 Aeneas asked if it's okay he tags along to Antwerp on Saturday, idk what you think? If you want him to go with us or... And I'm genuinely asking for you opinion here, you wanna go on a date or something afterwards? We can also talk about it at home if you want: 1
 How is your day going so far: 1
 True, but this is just one where it's clear right now: 1
 It was, guess I just wanted a little more excitement out of it, but I certainly enjoyed it!: 1
 At school working for BAP. Hope the food isn't terrible: 1

 Nope, but will do so in a minute: 1
 I think my general knowledge of this kind of shit isn't good enough to understand even half of what I'm reading but hey, that's what learning is for : 1
 Pretty nice help my parents a bit and gone drive home soon. When do meet up with the other people to watch ESC. Gone drive there?: 1
 Good morning Hon 🥰. Yeah we worked mostly on the design. Going to university now. Your plans for today?: 1
 At least it was fast though, that's good: 1
 You still want to call later?: 1
 Does it make me miss you more yeah? Yeah, but that would be the case anyway so not that big of a difference: 1
 I also do not know who half the people are because they have different names/pictures 🥲: 1
 Ups yeah from school but nothing else: 1
 Goodnight hon ❤️ and I miss you lots 😭❤️: 1
 And a German helmet is another way of saying the tip of the penis: 1
 But I miss you in general so much that that is really more of an oversight: 1
 Good morning my love hope you had a good night too 🥰.: 1
 Never ❤️: 1
 But its still captivating?: 1
 Would you be more motivated if you had someone watch you work on it?: 1
 I was scared that there is no outlet in rhe ice but then i found it and was really happy 😅: 1
 Thx I settled in by now. I am still missing a desk because the plat of the desk is not here. It takes a another week to get to the wood shop but everything else is here. Ah and my closet is still in use by the other guy. So it looks a bit messy 😅: 1

 Sounds interesting!: 1
 Now I'm just imagining things... I'm gonna go to sleep 😅❤️: 1
 Would like some snacks to but this joushold doesn't have shit: 1
 Moral of the story, don't get embarrassed to take pictures with me ;p: 1

 It just felted better: 1
 Can I call you now?: 1
 Ahh sooo cute: 1
 Leave him hon if he really love you ge will stay 😘: 1
 If it makes you feel better, I actually didn't stay awake until then, but I woke up a bunch of times and had a nightmare before waking up to read your message. After that I could finally go to sleep peacefully 😅: 1
 Probably a good idea: 1
 Oh, could you also take the car off the charger please? 😘: 1
 I don't know how to explain that one but yeah, guess we match on that one as well: 1
 Oh my schedule and uni stuff: 1
 In the last few days I just fall asleep: 1
 No the next one will be a nice guy not from Belgium though with a mustache: 1
 Do you have anything to do right now and if not, do you wanna call until DnD starts or something? I get it if you don't 😊: 1
 Same back to you: 1
 Guy is not getting it... Still convinced he'll spank his children... WHY: 1
 I just posted on my story that I got my licence and he congratulated me for that, so now he sent me pictures of his parents' new puppy: 1
 Fucking precious most lovely and stunning girl i know. I adore you and would do incredible hugs and kisses to you right now if we weren't that far apart. I just love you and miss you. My silly little rabbit. 😘🐇: 1

 Does he have some?: 1
 Lol, Alex made a LinkedIn account I see? 😂: 1
 Are you winning son?: 1
 How was your day? Did you start with your cousin on the project?: 1
 I'm glad your friend realised she was toxic, damn, it always sucks to see that happen to your friends: 1
 Favourite place to go/thing to do when you're upset?: 1
 That's good, would suck if one of you wanted to stay and the other was bored as hell just waiting: 1
 Apparently there's a lot of snow in Meraker... 🥳: 1

 Hopd you can sleep soon too and get some good rest: 1
 I got food and I almost got pickpocketed : 1
 Anything for you ❤️: 1
 Driving my bike home now, then I'll probably check it out: 1
 Problems with his cats? In what way? Sounds like you had a good time 😊: 1
 Nice, at least 1 of the Belgians is out already, lost his first match 😅🥲: 1

 Damn, no rest for the wicked huh? Good luck with that, hope it doesn't take too long ❤️: 1
 ... you have a dirty mind sir: 1
 It was kinda weird? You called me while I had to open the front door, but apparently you didn't call me, it was Lena and your mom because they wanted to show me an outfit or make up (idk) but I had to open the door so they were disappointed and after I opened the door they were gone already, but you were on the phone then, which was nice 😊: 1
 There's multiple German songs honestly: 1
 I am at thetram stop: 1
 Thanks hon 😅❤️: 1
 What's the best year in your life except this year and why what happened?: 1
 Yeah, it's where most of the booked is set. It's about a couple on their wedding night but they both have very different expectations of what is going to happen. Quite explicit at times but really interesting!: 1
 It's honestly really good: 1
 I'll check anyway: 1
 Yeah get that. Mabye today there will be something atleast a little bit interesting: 1
 (I'm massively exaggerating things, but the essence of it is kinda true): 1
 It needs to be a rollercoaster of emotion: 1
 Good morning my love 😘 Yeah, I slept pretty well 😊 I hope you had a great night too 😘: 1
 And they're nice: 1
 Yeah, we're gonna get lunch now: 1
 Perhaps!: 1
 The suspension is killing me: 1

 Eh.. well.. Slightly? got a shit ton to do, the video was from during lunch btw : 1
 You dont make any notes during dnd?: 1
 I think she is but doesn't want to admit it because he's literally... right there. If she gets scared now she's not gonna leave her house again or open the curtains of her room, ya know?: 1
 No I like it 😘: 1
 Well what are you up to right now?: 1
 Idk what you could do: 1
 Hope it's a mild period 🤞: 1
 When is the party tonight?: 1
 You got the parking part no worries: 1
 Hmm... It's always hard to tell yourself I guess?: 1
 Fuuuuuck: 1
 Enjoy your relaxing day 😘: 1
 Crazy congratulations to him and the group: 1
 Just watching something (not sure what) with my parents: 1
 Turns out driving is like riding a bicycle, you don't really forget how to do it 😁: 1
 Morning hon, I hope you had a safe drive over to your parents and you're having a nice breakfast with your family 😘: 1
 Oh yeah, I just remembered. You know Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis? Apparently they're in Ghent now. My coworker is very excited: 1

 This text summs up my feeling really really well and it's fits so well. I don't know: 1
 Paper and meet up with Alex. What about you any plans for today?: 1
 Still waiting for the answer for this one gone call there this week probably because they ignore my mails: 1
 yeah, I knew it first actually, i asked Alex if they wanted to play at my place again and suddenly Alex realized that work + dnd is not very possible : 1
 Or just call me when you can 😊: 1
 Yeah it's actually pretty good.: 1
 Also kind of doubting the dress like this but idk: 1
 You didn't give us a lot to go off though 😅: 1
 One question though, would it be possible to do datenight on Wednesday instead of Thursday this week?: 1
 Sounds relaxing. My phone has only 3% left and we are still out for 1 more hour😢: 1
 Going alright, a bit busy but not bad: 1
 What do you mean with that?: 1

 Love you hon and goodnight ❤️: 1
 Not much more: 1
 Everything in me is literally yelling at me to turn around: 1

 Sucks still the same thing as yesterday where they watch over you?: 1
 He's as far from English as can be 😂: 1
 I go time after the 7 of January so mabye around there. My grandfather celebrat his 80 birthday so all of my family will be there.: 1
 I just hope it wasn't because the interview was supposed to be at 1 or something stupid like that: 1
 Sounds nice.: 1
 Yeah, it was still pretty fun: 1
 I AM FREE: 1
 Yeah, idk, maybe the fact that I'll see you again today helped 😘: 1
 Oh shit 😅... That ain't good. Can you turn on the lights in the rest of the house?: 1
 Nothing much just woke up and sitting down for breakfast /lunch: 1
 So about Anthony: 1
 You can call anyone 'du' but it's disrespect full for some / in general: 1
 Is he the prof for all your courses today?: 1
 You too😘: 1
 Hamburg tight?: 1
 I'm not forgetting to eat food, I just can't eat: 1
 Good morning my night was pretty relaxing. Had a weird dream about my exsame. How was your night?: 1
 Freedom at last: 1
 It kind of is: 1
 Just got home, going to sleep now. Goodnight hon ❤️: 1
 Yeah, dreams are weird, kinda know where this one is coming from though. The whole Lars and Jinte thing may have something to do with it idk. : 1
 In the ICE there's always 1 for every 2 passengers thankfully! I'm also always really happy when the person next to me doesn't use it 😅😂: 1
 I figured, he sent me a picture of you a bit ago 😂: 1
 and good luck with your classes (if they aren't cancelled again): 1
 It's just the difference in moods for me, the Dutch guy is cocky as hell and the Belgian guy looks so nervous 😭: 1
 Or orange, I'm not sure: 1
 How were the Palmier cookies btw?: 1
 I don't know why but reading all your messages is nice: 1
 Sounds nice, have fun playing games and good luck with the chores/university work.: 1
 To be honest the chat itself is okay: 1
 Beautiful there like twins: 1
 How's the studying going? Not too tired?: 1
 How's your day going love? 😘: 1
 Bit hurt but nothing bad: 1
 But looks nice also still french: 1
 Yeah, same, my dad too btw. They also wanted to know if you were comfortable here and if you felt like they were hospitable enough, love them loads: 1
 I still hard to believe your coming over tomorrow. I love it but i still cant believe it. Love you and thanks i dont know what to say ❤️: 1
 Yeah, she was in a coma for a while so we saw it coming, just didn't know when: 1
 I'm even more clumsy today than usual... spilt my tea on myself twice, and almost fell down the stairs exactly the same was twice...: 1
 And I know you will probably say that's ridiculous: 1
 Happy for them: 1
 And Anthony... He sent me a message about french fries today so I think he's getting better, I'll let you know when I see them both tomorrow: 1
 I though so: 1
 Yeahhh, I get what you mean 😂: 1
 Good luck to him then: 1
 My is a memory of me and my cousin watching lion King on VS on the second Christmas day. I don't know why we just watch it all one one bed looking at a small screen.: 1
 Psycho with no regrets and new murder plans on her mind: 1
 I think you misunderstood: 1
 I mean, I definitely have a very specific imagine in my mind when you say nothing crazy going on, clearly you're jumping out of planes and all that: 1
 Hope you have a good time. Text any time you want to: 1
 What we gonna do in Portugal ?: 1
 Yeah will see no worrys: 1
 Yup, thankfully it's somehow still very usable: 1
 Really? Mabye the rest around it is good written: 1
 Same... Kind of doing it right now... Then again, I also know that if I finish this assignment I won't have anything else to do: 1
 I guess so, will probably be transcribing the interview tonight then: 1
 What time is the presentation tomorrow?: 1
 You're not gonna believe this... But the train is running 3 minutes faster than scheduled, so far at least: 1
 Please take good care of yourself, you're so precious. I love you. ❤️: 1
 Get that would feel the same way: 1

 Ah man: 1
 Oh yeah right!: 1
 I'll call you in 10 minutes then, okay?: 1
 Okayish did some chores and had my first class probably gone go to the cafeteria soon. How's your day going so far?: 1
 And quite frankly I also don't think it needs to be on 2 different platforms: 1
 Congratulations!! Glad you finally fixed it! : 1
 Actually no, I do have 1 trait I dislike. My mom's need for independence to the point where asking for help is pretty much impossible: 1
 You have any plans for today?: 1
 Ah, that's sad, hope you figure it out though!: 1
 I really feel like not seeing each other for one month is the maximum. The feeling of missing you is crazy today: 1
 Damm thats realy nice: 1
 Oh, career day! That makes more sense 😅: 1
 We also found out some more info about it: 1
 You got that no worries: 1

 Got home, wasn't that bad of a drive but goddamn, some of those roads are not made for cyclists 😅: 1
 Sorry if it seems that way. Most of the time I am tried but I can't sleep. Like I need at least 30min in bed to fall asleep. I also don't want too bore you(i know I probably don't but I don't know my thoughts go the other way) . I also thought about falling a sleep at the phone seems kinda weird to me and I don't know if I like it.: 1
 Sad but sounds like you had only good memories of her: 1
 It's too late, I can't understand them sorry 😅: 1
 Then how can you answer/do you know I sent one? That doesn't make sense: 1
 No time, schoolwork: 1
 How was volleyball? Feeling more energized?: 1
 Same for my family and my life. My sister and I start talk more about tis stuff but that's the only person in my family. I think i should tell more people that I love and appreciate them. I regret that I am also bad at staying in touch with some of my friends. But I try to change that's aspect of me.: 1
 I can't type: 1
 *Night = love, sorry 😅: 1
 Good morning, what're you up to today?: 1
 Yup, it really does: 1
 Alex has to get a root canal done or something, has been in pain for literal months and somehow can't talk to her parents about it, because it does cost quite a lot and also because somehow Alex is practically immune to sedatives and is terrified to go to the dentist: 1
 Pick up my sister from the train station and eat dinner together now we watching Kaleidoscope. How is your movie night going?: 1
 Ah, always nice : 1
 I love you and I never want to lose you: 1
 But yes, this would be a great way to do so 😅: 1
 Thank you! That's the song he was talking about indeed 😘: 1
 Plus make up itches: 1
 Nah, I think he wants to know if I could write the privacy policy for them... I mean, I guess I can try but I'm not entirely sure about it, it's a legal document you know? if I do something wrong the company could get sued in the future. Then again, their own fault for giving this task to an intern! How's it going? Not too bored yet?: 1
 Favourite and least favourite colour?: 1
 Also any funny scenario you got as a example?: 1

 Nachhaltigkeit: 1
 😅 Well it's true but very unlikely.: 1
 By the way i am making burger: 1
 These are moments where I'd absolutely love to just cuddle with you on a couch and do nothing for the rest of the day: 1
 Nice yeah Aeneas also send me the apparments  and told me he would go today. They look pretty nice. Yeah my day is going great kinda produktiv today feels good. Do a lot of work on my papers need to send them in on Friday but Friday is also dnd. So I need to finish it earlier like tomorrow probably.: 1
 Norway is gorgeous, but driving for 7 hours does get boring after a while. What are you up to?: 1
 Love you too hon. Wanna make you feel this way more often than the other way around / missing me 🥰: 1
 Restart the pc: 1
 It's absolutely ridiculous: 1
 Oh yeah... Man how do I forget so many things 😭: 1

 Well, I guess I'll have to believe in it to see it, so I'll believe as well: 1
 No worries, I'm a terrible influence on her too, I got her to spend €8 on the grabbing machines 😅: 1
 It's such stupid things to study 🥲: 1

 Yeah I think we need to call tomorrow Alex wants to hang out some more sorry. But I got time tomorrow 😘: 1
 I mean, technically I'm also following along on the conference in San Francisco at the same time but eh, who cares about that (it's the welcome speech): 1
 It was quit nice. The escape room was interesting we got the worst ending we only helped the bad guys and killed everyone except us. It was more story than escape room tbh. For dinner we cooked "Flammenkuchen" was tasty. How was you day?: 1
 Just did a little bit of stretching, yoga and some strength exercises for legs and arms: 1
 Nothing surprisingly: 1
 We can if you want to but i totally forgot and making food now: 1
 Sounds like a lot went to a underground minigolf courae: 1
 I'm not that clumsy when we dance 🥺: 1
 Good morning hon, hope you had a great time yesterday 😘 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 It kind of feels like Norway was a dream: 1

 And after that we're gonna see how to place them around the office, so yeah... interior design: 1
 Goodnight love, I hope you're not still working on the presentation 😅❤️: 1
 Although in my defence this is technically also Dutch so I made it easy for myself 😅: 1
 Just 2 more hour at work 🥳: 1
 My dad is perhaps forcing you to go watch football together with him: 1
 You can also start listening to a pot cast. That make me sleepy sometimes just listening to people talk: 1

 Yeah hope so: 1
 So I'm guessing later than 9?: 1
 Reading my book, Alex is supposed to be here soon. The book btw, is fucking insane. I feel like I might go crazy just by reading it 😅: 1
 Yeah... I think I'm just gonna 'work on it' for today, finish it and hope I get something else to do tomorrow, not gonna stress over it too much. Have fun (?) in class!: 1
 Okay yeah also gonna make me some food then 🥲: 1
 I would hope not: 1
 Also not a lasting solution: 1
 Thanks went really well. Alex is pissed off because of the exame length he had no time left: 1
 Looks nice but abit thin: 1
 I love you and I really hope you know I really appreciate everything you do and are too ❤️: 1

 Gives me energy: 1
 But still will see: 1
 Go hang out with your 16 year old gf: 1
 (after the shower for obvious reasons): 1
 Oh believe me, she was silly and way too insecure+ hiding it behind a small superiority complex... She wasn't bad at all, but I believe she changed a lot since then 😅: 1
 (I definitely did not directly translate a Flemish saying... No): 1
 It was nice! Anthony somehow cut his hand at the end though, so that was interesting!: 1
 Sounds not good for ones health but sure why not 😁: 1
 Nice hope you have a great time with Alex and mabye you can work together on your character and the stuff you still need to do for dnd tonight 🥰 hope you don't procrastinated to much on your BAP today 😘: 1
 It's going alright, I'm not gonna be able to finish all my work but oh well, not my problem. Hope you get a lot done today, get rid of the procrastination 😘: 1
 Idk why but it was and is a hard day for me too 😅: 1
 Thx: 1
 I'm gonna eat something small, no worries: 1
 Nice yeah but you should also take some headphones with you for the train: 1
 And wearing the new shirt I see?: 1
 One of the songs she will present on the show has a french title though, so I'm very curious what that's gonna be like!: 1
 You like it?: 1
 Great going out now with Alex to a friend.: 1
 Better take a nap then yeah: 1
 I mean... Safe is subjective: 1
 I'm blushing really really a lot right now 😶😳🥵: 1
 Just a duffel bag and my school backpack I think should be enough: 1
 He ask for it for a long time now. So I need to do it at some point so yeah. Manly because he keeps asking me for it.: 1
 He wants to still keep using the internet and wants to be "connected" and all but at some point he give me a headache because he keeps changing everything and dowmloading random shit that I neexmd to clean up 🥲: 1
 Your a cutie too 😘🧡: 1
 But apparently they always make the interns do the incisions: 1
 That's ... Interesting: 1
 Let me know when then?: 1
 Meet with some friends to go watch avatar 2 and good family time.: 1
 I just don't want to worry you and yet I say things like this anyway 😅: 1
 Sure, I'll be there in a couple of minutes 😊: 1
 Yeah we can definitely call tomorrow 🥰: 1
 Or just because it's an introduction class?: 1
 You are so goddamn cute, I can't handle it: 1
 Btw, don't forget to fill in the Google sheets: 1
 Hmm... sad, maybe they'll get better with time?: 1
 But i think you should get the head phones and go to sleep 🙏🏼: 1
 Well to be sure yeah xD: 1
 I think today will be fine, everyone is feeling lazy because the weather is too good: 1
 Sounds like a great thing to do when you're upset though: 1
 No idea but i could: 1
 I actually am gonna do it for free: 1
 No plan probably around 17 or so will see: 1
 I found a book on Instagram that looked interesting to read: 1
 She was drunk and we think Killian to at the point where they made out but we are not sure about both of them: 1
 Mabye but I am also on this one. Don't like it either especially because my family drag me too camping with them in the summertime from when I was 11 till I was 16 years. Was nice camping but the heat and the mosquitoes where 2x times worse than at home.: 1
 I'm just watching a series my dad recommended rn... No way I'm going to sleep soon 😅: 1
 I wanna see your pretty face 🥺: 1
 Whats the one think object u would never ever give up?: 1
 Very true, I never would have been able to experience that much if I had more classes: 1
 The dunks are nice this year: 1
 Haha... Yeahhhhh... Belgians don't care I guess: 1
 I'm glad you enjoyed your night then 😘: 1
 I like to go to a bridge near my house over some train tracks and just... Look around? I don't know, it feels soothing.: 1
 I can't believe you'll be here in a couple of hours ❤️: 1
 Yeah I did and he is a sweet sometimes: 1
 No volleyball?: 1
 Allways wanted to say that?: 1
 He didn't notice, but his girlfriend is Belgian and she asked where the package came from so yeah: 1
 You'll definitely get some, no worries 😘: 1
 Don't often feel like that, but thanks love 🫠: 1
 It's stuck in a traffic jam 🥲: 1
 I mean I probably should but not now... maybe next year 😅: 1
 Hope things calm down a bit then. Drive safe and have fun in Dresden 😘: 1
 You're a cutie and I love you 🥰: 1
 My day is alright, a bit boring so far but okay. Gonna go to the store with my dad in half an hour that's about it: 1
 Yeah you are her parent figure for sure but that all sounds like a good plan.: 1
 i mean well thats a lot of smart people there with alot of life experience: 1
 Mabye we can ask Anthony if he know where to find it?: 1
 Dirty me talk but i allways wanted to fuck somebody with colorful hair 😅😳: 1
 Don't think Jingwen would be stupid or reckless enough to give me that much power though 😅: 1
 Okay... I think we got most of it, but how many legs are there to a set?: 1
 Looks so soft 🥺: 1
 Can't forget about that one 😘: 1
 Oh okay yeah makes sense: 1
 I got the feeling that your day was good through your texts.: 1
 Hope class is going alright?: 1
 Sounds good hope she is not too sad about it mabye try to cheer her up if it doesn't work? Mabye get jinte with you: 1
 The christmas celebration is over for my family so now we sit back and watch some movies and play some games together. How was the snowshoe hike did u take some pictures?: 1
 I don't know if there's space, but if you can I'd suggest you just park in our street: 1
 Give me a couple of minutes: 1
 Nope on my way to getting naked 🤭: 1
 Hope the work helps but yeah, hope you can study with all the thoughts 🍀: 1
 We can but i will be sceptical: 1
 Very peculiar: 1
 Pretty sure it's about the vacation arrangements or something and it's not right because they keep saying "Schade": 1
 Yup would call them out if that happens: 1
 Booked a room at my uni for group work... 😅: 1
 Cute rawr: 1
 Oh yeah, did you figure out the problem you had yesterday? For me it's just more working on the analysis and then the presentation this afternoon. I feel like my slide is very much sad when I compare it to Gerardos though... He really put some effort in 😅: 1
 Gonna go to sleep soon so I can I dream off you ❤️: 1
 Yeah its nice. What are you up too for tonight?: 1
 Done with studying talk with my dad a bit and now just relaxing and mabye watching some series or something else.: 1
 Tell me more i wanna know: 1
 One thing I do have to say about going out so often is that once I get home I am so tired I can't think about how much I miss you for too long because I simply fall asleep 😅❤️: 1
 Love you too and good morning 😘: 1
 I think it was the trip when I realized it first 😅.: 1
 Thanks hon 😊😘: 1
 I was just sighing because I miss you: 1
 The only time I have ever seen you 'cry' and I'm not even sure that was you crying was back in Norway on the accidental sleepover... I don't think I would like to see you cry necessarily but it's cute to think of 😘 (though it also breaks my heart to think of, complex feelings idk): 1
 Ah... The protection is a really good trait, but I see your problem with the other trait: 1
 How'd changing the light go?: 1
 Makes it almost worth it: 1
 Please please: 1
 Not really.: 1
 He walked out of my room by himself, small blessings 😊: 1
 I miss you so fucking much.: 1
 But I want to call you 🥲: 1
 If you want to take a nap I'd do it on the train from Leipzig to Frankfurt, but make sure to put an alarm 😘: 1
 Apparently Anthony wasn't aware we're still playing DnD... I... I have a really hard time believing that honestly: 1
 Talk with Alex about it he either talks me down or we do stupid stuff together.: 1
 Yeahhhh... I still have to finish packing + quite honestly I don't think I'll sleep a lot tonight anyway, too afraid to oversleep 😅: 1
 I get that 110%: 1
 Thx hon  ❤️: 1
 No shit 😂: 1
 Oh? How come?: 1
 Would take a small nap after lunch and then call?: 1
 Procrastination really should be your second name 😅: 1
 Thanks darling: 1

 Omw now 🥰: 1
 Yeah... Finding people is Difficult as hell: 1
 Would love to try it: 1
 Uh... Well, some guy got too close while I was handing back some glasses, so that kinda sucked, also kinda scared me a little how fast Anthony was ready to fight the guy once I got back, but he was gone already: 1
 I wanted to ask if I should make a steam account or something if we want to play games together? Or idk how else, I'm a noob: 1
 It just said "other family members" so I used that but it turns out that's for children... But oh well 😅: 1
 You're a hottie ;p: 1
 Good luck with both! Yeah, it needs to be handed in at 5 today: 1

 You have ruined one of my favourite hobbies by existing and being awesome... I can't even be mad: 1
 Alex is busy and Jinte is not responding so I have tried but I shall not be social tonight: 1
 Hahah: 1
 I mean probably discord: 1
 But work is going quite alright, I actually feel like I'm doing something useful for once : 1
 And they respect my privacy not to read anything, but sometimes my mom gets curious so she asks who I'm chatting with: 1
 Yuppp... If none of my friends are going today I'm just sitting all the way in the back or something...: 1
 Also pretty much tripped when trying to hand in my exam 🥲: 1
 Yeah its annoying as fuck but i am sure you got it when you study a bit 😘: 1
 But I'm happy you like it ❤️: 1
 Hope your day will be great too 😘: 1
 They're nice: 1
 Well, maybe, you want to add more? I feel like the projects thing is more of a portfolio than something that should be on your resume, but then again I haven't looked into resumes for software developers so I could 100% be wrong: 1
 "Made" everybody put ther own things on there: 1
 Nothing really: 1
 I sure hope I dream about you, but I hope more that we meet in our dreams: 1
 Ah, you'll get there eventually: 1
 I expect to see pictures of the happy couple on their date though: 1
 Don't have a magnet and the arrow thing I have figured out but doesn't help much 😅: 1
 Okay, thanks! I don't think I know of any allergies... I just know Anthony doesn't eat brownies, that's it.: 1

 Also doing a Valentine's brunch box with my parents tomorrow apparently... I feel like I'm invading a date BUT food 😁: 1
 I wanna sleep 🥲: 1
 Good morning my love hope you had a good night 🥰.: 1
 Would have to actually look into it, also have to determine the moment a response counts, like in a conversation already or just a message sent out of nowhere, results would be very different: 1
 Leaving now, home in about 20 I think: 1
 Yeah, at 11: 1
 Thanks, they're my mom's 😂: 1
 And I am really slow at texting 😅: 1
 But I don't have the patience needed 😅: 1
 It also takes a while until its loading the days in: 1
 Hope your evening isn't too exhausting still 😘❤️: 1

 Our dear Lambert's day has been amazing obviously, considering I'm here with her: 1

 Making my self pretty and some university assiments: 1
 Trying to be polite?: 1
 Yes, just too bad I woke up in the middle of it 🥲: 1
 Batshit insane probably: 1

 Just now looking at the All Star game with my dad: 1

 You have home office for the rest of the week right? And how is it to be home all day but not really because you need to work?: 1
 I think it should be pretty nice, only thing that sucks is that we didn't eat and there's also nothing to eat here 😅🥲: 1
 Did you get any further in what you have to do?: 1
 Yeah but another time is hard to find right now: 1
 I do think either you got something wrong, or he did, because I did very much not get excellent grades for my bachelor thesis 😂: 1
 Yeah did get some done. Now it's tee and coffee time with my family. How is your day going. Still doing the German book?: 1
 You have no idea how relieved I am: 1
 Also have fun with this conversation I just had with Jinte... Why the fuck are we even friends??: 1
 I didn't see your message sorry 😅: 1
 No, he's the one doing the dishes currently: 1
 Morning, it's going okay abit of procrastination. But I got the day free so working on it the howl day. What are your plans for today?: 1
 Honey, we have a collective discord where no one has even said anything so far, I sincerely doubt it. But I'll go to the Monitoraat tomorrow for tutoring so hopefully that helps some: 1
 Else: 1
 Have fun, but ya know, don't fuck it up again too much 😘: 1
 Nevermind going to my grandparents for lunch.: 1
 Yeah get that doing the same but i still is difficulty still thinking about you. Like doing just anything and thinking it would be nicer with you or you would like it. Or just being alone and wishing you were here 🥲.: 1
 Fuck hormones and feelings and that teleportation is non-existant: 1
 I am so white that I sat outside in a little sunlight for 2 hours and now I'm sunburned... 🙃: 1
 How's your sister doing? Happy to be back? Kaleidoscope is pretty good, I hope you enjoy it! Movienight is going good, Barry keeps barking at the most random things though, but it's kinda funny.: 1
 Did you hear anything from Aeneas about his internship today?: 1
 Yeah, will see what they both say: 1
 Necrophilia is also not allowed for the record: 1
 Do you use the new bikes btw?: 1
 My night was good. Need to wake up early for classes though. How is work going today?: 1
 Yeah, they help me not be as tired during the day so I take them first thing in the morning: 1
 Sounds nice but exhausting. Yeah I think I will get it done today. Hope everything goes well for you today 😘: 1
 Nice import protest. Dont burn down the city 😅: 1
 We need to visit my sister in 30 min and watch dart with my family. I don't really care but my family is really into it around Christmas every year: 1
 Yeah but I talk with them after words and got a bad vibe from the team each so I declined the offer. I still have two open will see.: 1
 I slept alright I guess. We're doing some more family activities today, going out for lunch and then a walk I think. What are your plans?: 1
 Only for you hon, I'm only your dirty slut 😘: 1
 Still feels fucking weird: 1
 Thank you but no?  I am not cutie right now, I am confused and sad potato: 1
 Did you get to study?: 1
 I know it's possible but I'm Belgian... It's better to expect the worst: 1
 Might be able to finish my to do list mostly after all. How's your afternoon?: 1
 Sounds nice to meet new people. BAP went well, did 2 interviews today, was quite nice: 1
 We now eat lunch gor the last time and then drive home: 1
 Ah, you probably are doing something already: 1
 Oh yeah, I was wondering, how does your job work? Do you just get assignments you can do in your own time or do you have specific work hours?: 1
 Just procrastination at its finest how about you ?: 1
 Eh, I'll live: 1
 Thats looks like a dick: 1
 I am missing you like crazy right now it sucks: 1
 Hope you have a productive/fun day 😘: 1
 Or ruining your evening: 1
 Yeah that's the curse of phones and other media device you can't study anymore 😅: 1
 I am home now. Thank God I love her but sometimes she is just too much talk and you can't stop her 🥲: 1
 Would say you can sleep in the car but considering your dad lost his licence that's not really the case: 1
 Shit, I forgot to tell you, I can't tomorrow 😭: 1
 For God's sake, I can't do next Thursday either... Fucking bullshit...: 1
 It's okay we can reschedule: 1
 I do, but it's stupid: 1
 Normally he is but he got something in his drunk head: 1
 Because I ate 3 of them today (they're kinda nice) and my dad was like "no one eats them, take them with you": 1
 ? okay why sounds weird: 1
 ah fuck thanks for reminding me.: 1
 It's endearing 😘: 1
 Just some stuff Jinte needed for Morocco, a reflective heat blanket and then for both of us some sunscreen: 1
 I don't see why you should apologize for that?? Also I do the same spacing so often 😂: 1
 I should go to sleep soon because I am indeed tired as fuck, but the way you said goodbye including that factoid made me feel like I was somehow being sent to bed like a kid and I have an issue with authority telling me what to do with my own body so now I refuse to go to sleep soon: 1
 It's gone be alright. Your are a group and she can't fail you all: 1
 Calling Alex about our campaign... That we are still farrr from finishing... 🥲: 1
 Cruel cruel but oh so sexy man: 1
 Okay! Have fun, let me know what you think of it!: 1
 Indeed. Blessed be the algorithm: 1
 Nice, always love random knowledge: 1
 What are you up to today? 😊: 1
 Another one of Alex's stickers?: 1
 Just an idea: 1

 What's the conference about the meeting you invite everybody for your bosses: 1
 In your opinion, is it better to work for school now I'm motivated or go to dance class?: 1
 Still eating but we can call already if you want: 1
 The cards told me soooooo oooh: 1
 Okay, I can work with that: 1
 Yeah crazy right: 1
 Don't have one like that: 1
 Love you rabbit ❤️🐇: 1
 Thanks hope so too. I am kinda nervous ☺️: 1
 That's a good idea! I'll tell Alex 😘: 1
 oh okaayn: 1
 My day was pretty good, didn't unpack everything but I'll get there... Maybe tomorrow! Did go on a walk and saw Jinte which was very nice, so I feel quite good about today. How about you?: 1
 Have fun with Marco: 1
 Ah... Well... Yeah, I feel sorry for you in that case 😅: 1
 Does it make sense that I want to talk to you but I also really don't have the energy to put effort into that?: 1
 Yeah... Probably stuck with it for at least another week: 1
 👍🏻 Good decision. The Kitchen Floor 😬?: 1
 Beautiful cat: 1
 Frauenfeld: 1
 That's great!! Let me know how it went afterwards? I'm excited for you 😊: 1
 That's true,  you can definitely find some interesting stuff but mostly it just sounds pretty boring 😅: 1
 By how and for what?: 1
 Thank you?: 1
 You look cute 😘: 1
 We knew someone that was here and we want to see him but he left early so. I don't know really?: 1
 Yeah no, I would say we don't have it anywhere: 1
 Love you too 💕: 1
 Do you want tea?: 1
 I have to annotate a meeting that takes place from 4: 1
 Yes, definitely a date 🥰: 1
 Yeah I was so nervous about the cooking. While we were cooking my hard was beating so fast: 1
 All have cats except me 🥲: 1
 Not physically unfortunately 🥲: 1
 Driving home now will write you then: 1
 Hmm, Yeah, fair: 1
 Hahah, guess we'll have to ask him some other time then. Maybe I'll just send him a message to ask: 1
 Sometimes you are special more so than normally obviously allways in a good wayv😅🥰: 1
 Yeah, me too...: 1
 Limoncello? Whats this?: 1
 Still working or what are you up too?: 1
 You're working on the presentation alone right now? Or are you at uni with Alex or something?: 1
 How is studying going my love: 1
 NO WORRIES: 1
 I have already given up paying attention to this class 😅: 1
 Morning, did you sleep alright? Good luck with your 4 classes ❤️: 1
 Aw so cute ❤️: 1
 Your lunch looks great ☺️: 1
 Oh yeah right i forgot about your cousins. They are also coming: 1
 Okayish still got a lot too do but its getting done: 1
 That's kinda funny: 1
 Yeah and still be in same groups: 1
 Big bang?: 1
 Eating with my mom's side of the family. In a hour: 1
 What about the way I say it bothers you? Just to know what not to do in the future: 1
 I don't mind the call 😂 Was happy to see and hear you 😘: 1
 I am a big fan of kimchi ramen, that shit is amazing: 1
 Exactly 😘: 1
 Do I know these people but sure: 1
 Yeah got volleyball and probably gone go out to eat with my parents. They couldn't do it today: 1
 You better 😘: 1
 Hey nice getting new friends: 1
 Yeah he just build some stuff with big Lego and shows it to me or he play fireman with his toys.: 1
 I have seen it before, but yeah: 1
 And I probably won't get the motivation to do anything until later tonight around 9: 1
 Okay so you will take the 1-2 more sessions ?: 1
 Jinte and Lars...: 1
 As soon as you know when your meeting is we can book some things: 1
 Except for this, I fully meant this: 1
 Goodnight my lovely silly goose ❤️ (it simply doesn't feel right without the silly on it, idk why): 1
 So basically Lars said he might be interested but he knows she doesn't want a relationship right now. Which is true, but she also kinda likes him (has since high school) so she doesn't want a relationship right now but doesn't want to exclude the possibility for the future... So they're staying friends? For now?: 1
 okay sounds good hope iit works: 1
 It has a weird positiv vibe: 1
 Geuss will do that: 1
 Okay rip but you got experience in that field of the db: 1
 Should be interesting: 1
 That's too bad. Hope you have a great time, be safe 😘: 1
 Hmmmm... Let me get back to go on that: 1
 I get what's mainly wrong now though: 1
 There's a whole story behind it, I'll tell you later?: 1
 Wanna talk about it?: 1
 Playing game and eating a pizza right now so my evening is going nicely but i thing i will sleep soon: 1
 Ahhhh, okay, that makes sense!: 1
 Tsss: 1
 Pray so too going to hotel now. Text you later: 1
 I would like too: 1
 3/4 dead: 1
 My reception is shit here: 1
 No, still waiting for it: 1
 And cuddle: 1
 Yeah slept good, how was your night?: 1
 Oh shit, what happened?: 1
 Turns out my cousin is doing an art atelier all day. I'm at the store with my parents and aunt now: 1
 Well hope the jinte and Lars think will be over soon / forgotten: 1
 Yeah, it was very good food 😊: 1
 If you wanna go alone uhm... We wanted to do burgers, so buns, some veggie burgers and some tomatoes or something? Maybe some salad to have with it: 1
 Still need to prepare for DnD and some preparation for a meeting I have tomorrow... 30 minutes max I think, nothing to worry about. Yeah, we don't have a workplace tour before we start, just have to show up next Tuesday and then we'll have an introduction day apparently.: 1
 … Why the fuck are you this cute, it should not be legal: 1
 I just told her not to lead him on if she doesn't feel like it's gonna turn into anything anytime soon. She said she doesn't know, but he's also kind of involved with that couple so... God, it's just too confusing and I'm not sure, they could either be a great couple or they could find out they aren't compatible like that at all in the first 3 weeks... At this point they both suck at deciding so nothing is changing so far but yeah... He should have waited a little longer with this one 😅: 1
 It's okay, did you have a nice night? I'd much rather you have me wait than being unsafe: 1
 Love you hon and  your a great person.: 1
 We'll probably also be home way earlier than expected, around 9 or something: 1
 If you're not too tired we can, but I guess there's no real difference in calling or texting so whatever you prefer: 1
 Happy valentine's day my love 😘❤️: 1
 What are you having for lunch? My day is going alright, thinking about taking a nap though: 1
 I don't know, what were you guys thinking for dinner?: 1
 Just put it on for the sake of feeling like you're doing something?: 1
 (also turns out it's been almost 5 years since we last saw each other properly 😅): 1
 Yeah, sounds nice: 1
 Eh, I would do it for free: 1
 Oh yeah for sure: 1
 Morning love 😘, Jesus Christ you wake up way too early 😅... I also woke up at 6 but went back to sleep immediately until just now: 1
 Cutie, totally get that though, alone time is definitely nice sometimes: 1
 Ohh yeah kinda forgot that 😓 well mabye there are some not that much focus on you armpits: 1
 Great love to hear that: 1
 Nah, the cold is kinda going away, but now I just feel weak as fuck: 1
 That's maybe a weird thing to thank you for <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Well, so far yes, but who knows, she's only had the business for a year: 1
 You're cute and I love you so much 😘: 1
 No clue what you could do now either... Watch a movie? Read a book? Solve a puzzle? Talk to me? ;): 1
 Good morning, I'm going to Brussels today : 1
 What are you up to in the meantime?: 1
 Shitty but i dont know why? Just one of those days: 1
 What book you gone read?: 1
 Nah, I'm just kidding, don't worry ;): 1
 Pfftt, people in general are a mystery to me, but Anthony is pretty simple, especially with the way he opened up to me in Norway. All he wants is to be accepted and to feel wanted. He often feels alone, but in part that is his own fault for not reaching out to anyone himself. Oh, and he is deeply and utterly in love with Claire, which doesn't help his self esteem because he puts her on a too high pedestal, making him think he's 'unworthy' of her.: 1
 I have no idea if they're good or not, guess we'll find out sooner or later?: 1
 If my parents argue about anything it's usually that too: 1
 I am hypt but i totally forgot where we left of last time: 1
 Better make the best of it! Going anywhere else after this?: 1
 Then again, eh, I kinda like looking through cooking books, we'll see: 1
 That sucks but I would be a pack weekend. Mabye it's better you can relax abit 😘. Have great night I am going to bed now : 1
 If you want to we definitely can 😘: 1
 But why can't we call because of the work you have to do right?: 1
 Still 11 days: 1
 Nah, you don't have to buy it, it's all good. Also really bad nutritionally 😅: 1
 My way quite honestly sucked, just slept through most of it honestly. It's only now that I'm feeling a little bit better and I just got to eat something. No worries, I'll be better soon! I'm not the only one, my grandpa also isn't feeling too good, but I think it might have been food poisoning from the sushi we had yesterday. How was your day? I hope a lot better than mine!: 1
 Fair enough, sleep is very nice! We still have at least 2 hours of driving to go... The roads aren't great and we had to take a detour because one of the mountain passes was closed: 1
 Please explain to me why there's just as many books in english as there are in Italian and Spanish??: 1
 For their fake plants: 1
 Probably gone watch a show eat and go to sleep again need to be out tomorrow early again but fo4 the last time 🥳: 1

 Hope you get some good sleep tonight: 1
 Dude... You're too fucking gorgeous I can't, I've been staring at your face basically the whole call: 1
 Can't tell me I have 4 books of 1000+ pages and yet I still can't find the law I'm looking for? Ridiculous: 1

 Well atleast you got good consulting: 1
 No i swear: 1
 Glad it's going down, but damn that took a long while... Hope you're okay: 1
 Just out of curiosity, is it a coincidence that you liked the ones that were the most 'proper' more than the ones that show some more skin?: 1
 Greetings back!!: 1
 You tell me I'm your bitch but cursing over text is too far 🤭: 1
 Just saying that befor dont know if that makes any difference or senses to say befor. But i love you allot like a shit lot. Like that much that i would say it every living minute if it means i can stay with you: 1

 I hope you're having a lovely day hon ❤: 1
 I've actually always wondered, did you cry that night? Because I know there was a kind of joke that I was the only one not to but I was never sure: 1
 Hope so, almost went to world's end and bought a MTG deck but then realised I have no clue what I'm looking at so if you don't mind we can do that together if we find some time?: 1

 My cousin is coming in an hour, just enough time for me to take a nice (though lonely ;)) shower and eat some breakfast. I don't know when she's going home, but probably not too late. I have planned nothing else today and I kinda hope she leaves around 7 or something so we can have our movie date 😊: 1
 Btw, are we doing datenight tonight?: 1
 Okay, no problem, that's why I'm asking: 1
 I will!: 1
 Procrastination to a toll on that: 1

 Not gonna lie though, not entirely happy you left me 🥲: 1
 Okay enjoy what ever you do tonight too sorry again 😘: 1
 Can you add it to the tricount?: 1
 No actually I ate before: 1
 I am happy you're safely home, hope you get some sleep now 😘: 1
 I am really happy about all the time we spent together last week but also feel kinda sorry that that means you have to catch up on all the work 😅: 1
 Gerardo brought his girlfriend along to the after work drinks and I was just _slightly_ jealous: 1
 Ahh, okay, how was it?: 1
 But the guy (the trainee) also had to pull out an instruction manual for how to handle it when people ask for emergency contraception and had to go over the whole thing 😂😅: 1
 Will be there in 40 minutes: 1
 Okay, sure will see if his connection is stable: 1
 Slutshaming me? I see: 1
 Eh, it's kind of okay, really interesting to see the amount of traffic fines this woman has, absolutely insane: 1
 gone call you in a 5 min: 1
 My brain says Noodle with some good tomatoe Soße. But my heart says my mum's (eierkuchen) Pancakes. You?: 1
 Yeah we going to shopping now. What are your doing now or are your plans for the rest of the day: 1
 Crazy 😳. Nothing much just relaxing with Alex and Killian: 1
 What do you mean? She decides to leave early herself: 1
 Do I bring a present for everyone? Wait, do you guys do something for Easter?: 1
 Jinte here : 1
 Fucking hate it when that just happens out of no where...: 1
 So basically he only visited 1/3 apartments today because the first one didn't show up and the second one the guy didn't have the keys for... So he's going back on Monday to visit those last 2: 1
 Yes she is and such a great person: 1
 Sorry hope tomorrow it changes 😘: 1
 We should go to sleep: 1
 So you don't want to? I'll let him know: 1
 I can read smut in public without any issues. Have done so in the past, it's really not that difficult once you get desensitized enough: 1
 You won't and you can't your amazing and last time we did a one shot is was great too: 1
 Just getting a cup of tea and then I'll call you: 1
 Will see don't try to rush or too force it. We can do it any day I have nothing much planned except Saturday: 1
 True, very very true: 1
 Alex, Patrick and me are going to a street food festival in Leipzig later and then hanging out probably some billiard and stuff.: 1
 As if you don't know the answer to that already: 1
 I'm going to the store for a bag of rocks now: 1
 Or well, he's 'keeping me company' 😜: 1
 Oh, nice! Let me know if you have any questions or if you just wanna look over it together!: 1
 Yeah, no worries, the floor is soft: 1
 It's like friends or professional if they allow it but most of the times it's family and friends.: 1
 It's okay I don't mind to much: 1
 You sure you're okay?: 1
 Christophe ?: 1
 Procrastination and a bit of university 🥲.: 1
 Same btw 😘❤️: 1
 Well I am really tired but if you want to we can call until I fall asleep?: 1
 The thought fills me with happiness: 1
 Oh yeah! Pieter's mom really likes that show! I don't think she realises it's a bit more dramatic than actual events though 😅: 1
 You thought so? Damn, what else do you know?? Crazy how you can read my mind sometimes: 1
 My camera is kinda shit 😅: 1
 I am also the only one who hasn't bought anything so far: 1
 Oh, she's not that old!: 1
 Here are some pictures of Alex with people we talk too. I don't like taking pictures mabye if somebody was really interesting.: 1
 Well, if we know the person is fine with it and it's generally known it happens sometimes: 1
 Love to hear that 🥰. My day was alright didn't do much. Wanted to change my tires finally but they said the next date would be Saturday so waiting aaaah.: 1
 Basically 😂: 1
 You can roast the potatoes and paprika for 25 minutes at 190°c and add the tomatoes in 10 minutes before the end: 1
 Which is honestly incredible now I think about it: 1
 Cute dog, way too early though: 1
 Monday works for me : 1
 The story was meh but the visuals where really good: 1
 That she definitely does 😂 <Diese Nachricht wurde bearbeitet.>: 1
 Why does this happen when I'm at work 🥲: 1
 And going around your lower half: 1
 Ate something and now writing for the assignment: 1
 Very clear: 1
 Good morning, what's on your planning today?: 1
 I'm gonna have tomato soup for lunch. You know what you're having?: 1
 Sorry what: 1
 His dad is trying to set us up... I fucking hate this: 1
 Well yeah just be there in any case i geuss and mabye look for abit of red flags: 1
 Man i wanna be there right now sooo badly. Just saying you got this 🥰❤️: 1
 Well mabye do them while you talk bad about your boss with your senior: 1
 That's why I'm asking: 1
 I didn't look at it afterwards but yeah: 1
 They should though, that should be mandatory, at least some classes for it: 1
 I'm not sure nice is the correct translation honestly... The Dutch word is 'braaf', I think she's just saying that the combined evilness or edgyness of the people around me would probably be 0 and she doesn't really like it too much for some reason? It's always funny to me how she wants me to do the exact opposite of what most parents would want their kids to do 😂: 1
 Yo, you know I would but you told me not to: 1
 And getting tips for Berlin: 1
 Going to Leipzig with alex now and meeting up with Patrick will see what we do ☺️: 1
 Idk, Moustache has almost learned how to manipulate my dad into giving him second dinner?: 1
 Over all a nice night qlso went billiard and table tennis playing: 1
 Okido : 1
 I don't know if it's getting worse because I know I'll see you soon or because it's been so long since I've seen you but it doesn't feel nice 😅: 1
 Leipzig main train station or "haubt Bahnhof" would be the easiest: 1
 Just something stupid about the book I was reading, nothing important: 1
 Today I fucked up by having Jinte look up a book I know nothing about: 1
 The rapper?: 1
 8 sounds good. : 1
 Could be worse: 1
 Great nap only 20~30 min but great 🥰: 1
 Gone take a shower now write you back in 30 mins or so: 1
 Yeah sorry we started a game: 1
 I can definitely work from home, I just really benefit from having other people that are working around me. Pretty sure just having someone on videocall or something would be enough too though.: 1
 Maybe I'm just losing my creativity from being back in Belgium, who knows?: 1
 Thanks for always supporting me love 😘: 1
 True 😅: 1
 If you're too bored join us on discord and just not say a word, see how long it takes Alex to notice you're there: 1
 Apparently Anthony might join later as well: 1
 If you still wanna call after let me know, but eating and sleeping definitely goes first if you ask me, your health is important to me: 1
 Well hope you don't feel like a 3 wheel: 1
 That is kind of logical, I'm still in bed, I should be falling asleep now yet I'm awake : 1
 Eh, I had a hard time falling asleep. I'm in a meeting for BAP right now, think that's the only thing I will do today. Oh, and apparently they're working on the window again today, hopefully that means it will be done sooner : 1
 I love how you go against the stereotypes so well though ;p: 1
 He tried something, but I didn't have anything in my pockets, so he quickly left again I guess, not entirely sure: 1
 Don't worry about it, I figured you'd be busy today 😘: 1
 It's worse than I thought, I might have to sacrifice a friendship on this one: 1
 Yeah body whise its really awful for you. Stress is a killer: 1
 I should just share my calendar with you goddamn: 1
 Or sexy would be a better therm: 1
 Okay, hope you at least get some interesting things from it: 1
 😁 Nice it's paratical knowledge. But yeah mabye around 17: 1
 I'm gonna fucking miss you train I know it: 1
 Haha... Relaxing 😅... Sure! After work I thankfully have nothing planned though. How about you?: 1
 I'm sorry 😅😘: 1
 Urg: 1
 Yeah sounds like they treat you like children. Really nice of them 🙃: 1
 We're now in the tram: 1
 Hope you find some place 😘, am hanging out with Alex now : 1
 Yeah it's okay I can live with that. It is deserved to be fair 😅: 1
 Alex was shocked that he wasn't the coolest 😅: 1
 Hey hey, honey, you can choose, either I wear your sweater or I wear the outfit from yesterday, but I'm not doing both 😂: 1
 Can I call you when I get home? In +-15 minutes?: 1
 Alex almost did: 1
 Saying goodbye is hard but I'd rather have those moments too than to give those away. Any moment more with you is worth it. So I also won't be walking away before the train leaves again: 1
 Yeah my sister does it: 1
 Yes please, take good care of yourself! Do some mental health exercises or something, definitely go for a walk! No matter how much I hate mental health walks, they fucking work 😅: 1
 Going to bed now 🙏🏼: 1
 The show is really good... Forgot how much I liked it, we're just constantly talking about it, it's a lot of fun 😊: 1
 Drive safe, hope you had a good time 😊: 1
 I hope you don't have too exciting plans for the weekend so you can rest up? 😅: 1
 Yeah i would think so also trying to apologize to the fur baby is sooo hard hope he gets it though: 1
 Yeahhh, watching those with my parents was hella embarrassing 😅... I think I was 13 or something... A lot of sex scenes.... 😂: 1
 Yeah no idea will see: 1
 You're feeling kinda rested? You only got home around 3...: 1
 Yeah no worries. I wanna call you today or any other day but rather sooner than later. Also we can call anytime today so if you wanna be there the howl time for dinner we can call earlier if you wanna too.: 1
 It would have been way too fucking easy to commit identity fraud in 2008: 1
 They have me analysing cookies now, and how best to stalk our prospective customers when they go on our website I guess? It's actually pretty interesting, kinda like it : 1
 Jesus, bit last minute to cancel but better late than never I guess. Uhm... really hard to say, Elisa made 3 types of tiramisu, Alexandra made these amazing potatoes with 2 types of sauce, then there was Dahl and Angelos made Fava spread (I'm taking some home because there was so much left) Oh, and Cyril made these great plantains, honestly impossible to choose which was best...: 1
 Okay, see you soon!: 1
 He ask some questions will write you then later. We are at the open kitchen now.: 1
 Just watching a random series so nothing much: 1
 Hmm, yeah, maybe I'll eat a honey waffle, not hungry though. How's your afternoon going? getting somewhere with that one pager?: 1
 Damn... You guys strike once a year? Fuck, wish that was the case over here, public transport strikes at least once every month...: 1
 You're still working on it now?: 1
 And brunching with my dad's site of the family: 1
 yeah probably: 1
 Alright, gotta get through at least another PowerPoint to be done for today though: 1
 The political ads are the worse on in the world: 1
 Sounds like a great time! Dance class was good, but we had a bit of improv which I'm not great at. We train a couple of weeks, so next week we start a new dance normally. Please send me a picture of your new hair! Yeah, we're going for dinner with my grandpa, it was his birthday yesterday. Tabasco is coming tomorrow: 1
 Didn't buy the pillow, it was 30 euros and didn't fit in my bag: 1
 That's good! Keep up the good work then ;): 1
 Yeah, I get that, it's the same for me but I think it's still something that annoys you a bit no? I don't care if it's something you feel is unimportant, but if something is bothering you please tell me. Especially if it's things like our communication because as it turns out, both of us were kind of suffering from it: 1
 You're done studying or still working on it?: 1
 My night was pretty shit actually 😅... Woke up like 20 times. But! I did dream about you, so that was nice. Also dreamt about us being robbed though so 😅: 1
 How was my first session?: 1
 Same girl they always say I have zero emotions while presenting: 1
 Yeahhhh, so, we're rooting for England tomorrow? 🙃: 1
 Sounds like a weird dream indeed 😅: 1
 Sounds like that works really well, would try the same if I knew anyone in my classes who would want to do that: 1
 You can have one probably 😅: 1
 If you're okay with it, I totally forgot to ask you, sorry 😅: 1
 You sure because there is a business think on the 27 and I need to tell the if the date fits. Not sure but mabye you can come along if you want to?: 1

 You know the game shell shock live? He coded a aimbot for it. Now the update some stuff for it and it doesn't work anymore so he is debugging the game and looking for the reason. If you would like to know more let me know it will take a while too explain it.: 1
 Excuse me what??? How did that happen?? Did you send them an email about it? That's ridiculous...: 1
 *Isn't: 1
